Picking the Perfect Pooch

Introduction First thing’s first: despite the title of this report, there is no such thing as a perfect pooch (just as there is no such thing as a perfect human). The closest you can come to picking the perfect pooch is to pick one that’s best for you and your family. You know what’s weird? Dog owners all believe their dog’s personality is distinct and unique. Even if they own two dogs of the same breed, perhaps even from the same litter, they’ll say each dog has a personality all his own. And they’ll be right. And yet many of those same people believe that dog personalities are determined by breed. They’ll say things like “Golden Retrievers don’t bite,” or “Pit Bulls are vicious.” And they’ll be wrong. A dog’s personality, like that of a child, is determined more by “nurture” than “nature.” Depending on how he’s raised, a Golden Retriever will bite and be vicious; a Pit Bull will be a gentle coward.

4

It is true that dogs of a certain breed may share some behavioral characteristics (e.g., most Labrador Retrievers enjoy swimming and are crazy about fetching a ball). There are exceptions to every rule, but knowing behavioral (as well as physical) characteristics will help you to decide on a dog that will likely be a good fit for you and your lifestyle. We’ll cover that later in this report. But looking beyond the breed characteristics and picking a dog based on his individual personality is a very important—yet often overlooked—step in finding a dog that’s best for you and your family. Keep an open mind about what type of pooch to pick until after you’ve done your homework. You and your soon-to-be best friend will be much happier with the results. First step: Keep reading!

Puppy or Adult?

Should you get a puppy or an adult dog? This is the first decision you need to make before picking a pooch. Please give this some serious thought. If you do, your final decision may surprise you.

5

Most people don’t even think about the adult dog option—they just go out and get a puppy. They’re so cute! Adorable! Fun! Just the word “puppy” makes most people feel all warm and fuzzy inside. But perhaps you should at least consider the benefits of an adult dog before making your decision:


The habits, manners, and temperament of an adult dog (at least two years old) are already established and easy for you to evaluate. Most dog rescue groups, shelters, adoption services, etc., will allow you to take a dog on a trial basis. You can take him home for a few days to see if his personality is compatible with you, your family, your other pets—in other words, you can find out if the dog fits what you’re looking for a in a new furry companion. If not, you can usually take him back. With a puppy, on the other hand, you won’t necessarily know what kind of dog he will turn out to be, because this will depend very much on you and the time you spend with him.



Adult dogs typically require less care, attention and training than puppies. An adult dog doesn’t need to go to the bathroom as often as a puppy. They are usually housetrained, and often know the difference between a chew toy and a your favorite pair of shoes. An adopted adult dog may be an ideal “out of the box” companion that is so well trained, affectionate and “perfect” that you’ll wonder how anyone could give him up. But there is the possibility of the other extreme, as well. Each dog is unique. (Hence the importance of the trial adoption period.)



Adult dogs are less likely to be adopted from shelters than puppies. If you want to rescue a dog, picking an older one is more likely to save a life.

The key to finding a good adult dog is to take plenty of time to evaluate his habits, behavior, and personality. Proper training can correct many bad habits and teach good ones (yes, you certainly can teach an old dog new tricks!); but not all behavioral problems can be overcome.

6

A puppy, on the other hand, is like a lump of clay waiting to be molded by you. You can raise him to be your ideal companion. This, of course, presumes you know how to train a dog properly and have the time—and the desire—to do so. But because you’re reading this report and have subscribed to the Happy Mutt Training System, we know you’re one of those rare humans who realize what’s involved and is willing to go through it anyway—and that whatever pooch you bring home is going to be one lucky, welltrained, well-adjusted dog! Keep this in mind: An adorable puppy will become an adolescent dog with a few months; that adolescent will quickly become an adult dog that can live from 10 to 20 years. So when considering a puppy, put a lot of thought into the grown dog it will become, and the long-term commitment you will make. All adult dogs were once adorable puppies, and all adorable puppies will grow into adult dogs.

7

What Kind of Dog?
Mixed-Breed or Pure-Breed? After deciding to get a puppy or adult dog, the next question is: What kind of dog is best—mixed-breed (mutt) or pure-breed? There are fans on both sides of this question who would never consider owning the “other” choice. Then there are people who just want a great companion and don’t care whether he’s a mutt or an AKC champion. [Note: We use the term “mutt” with affection. We have a warm spot in our heart for mutts. But we love all kinds of dogs!] As with the puppy or adult dog decision, there are pros and cons to both mutt and purebreed options. Pure-breed puppies are more predictable in terms of behavioral and physical characteristics. In many cases before picking a pure-breed puppy, you can check out the appearance, friendliness, basic manners, and general health of his parents. Sometimes too much breeding/inbreeding, or breeding to achieve a desirable physical characteristic (such as the flattened nose of a Pug), can create health problems. Purebreed dogs can be expensive. Depending on the breed, a pure-breed puppy will typically cost several hundred dollars. A mutt, on the other hand, is pretty much a one-of-a-kind dog. If you’re adopting a mutt puppy from a friend, you might see what the mother is like, but the father is often a total mystery. If you adopt from a shelter, you can only guess about both parents. Mutts generally have fewer health problems and tend to live longer than pure-breed dogs. And mutt puppies are much cheaper (often free). You cannot simply select the "perfect" breed or the "perfect" individual puppy and have him automatically grow up to be a "perfect" adult dog.

8

Any puppy (mutt or pure-breed) can become a wonderful companion if properly raised and trained. Conversely, any puppy can become a canine nightmare if not properly raised and trained. Regardless of pedigree (or lack thereof), you should pick a pooch that is best suited to you and your lifestyle.

Big or Small? Whether you want a mutt or pure-breed, the next thing you should think about is the size of the dog. If you live in an apartment, you may think it’s best to limit your pooch possibilities to small dogs. But you don’t have to. Large dogs can make wonderful apartment companions as long as they receive regular exercise during walks or dog park visits. Large dogs are often calmer and quieter than small dogs (less barking for neighbors to complain about). Dogs of any size will make great apartment pets as long as they are properly trained.

9

If you have small children, would a small dog be better? Not necessarily. Any dog, regardless of size or breed, may be frightened and irritated by children. A dog that feels threatened is more likely to bite. Of course, the bite of a Chihuahua will be less severe than that of a Rottweiler. Dogs of any size can make good companions for children if they are properly trained and socialized around children (but also make sure your children are taught how to act around dogs). Small dogs eat less (so are cheaper to feed); and you’ll have smaller piles of poop to clean up, of course. They can be easier to control (they are not physically able to drag you down the street during your walk). But again, proper training will enable you to control any dog of any size. Do Breed Research If you’ve decided on a pure-breed dog of a particular size, it’s time to do specific research and consider behavioral traits as well as physical ones. If you pick a purebreed pooch without doing your homework, you may be in for some surprises. For example, Border Collies are very smart dogs, so you might think this would be a great choice. But super-smart dogs actually require more attention and care than average-intelligence dogs. They need mental exercise as well as physical exercise. Like bright students, they tend to get bored easily—and a bored dog is not a good thing. If you find a particular breed of dog appealing, get information about it from appropriate resources:


Ask a veterinarian if the breed is prone to any health issues. Get “reviews” from people who actually own the breed. Go online. The Internet makes research easy. Just do a search for the breed and you’ll find several web sites. Don’t limit your reading to just one site; pay particular attention to comments made in online discussion forums (by owners and trainers as well as breeders). Look for tendencies and traits that you do not want, such as aggressiveness toward other dogs. Get several opinions. People who complain



10

about behavioral problems—such as a Schnauzer that barks too much or a Chihuahua that still pees in the house at two years old—may not have trained them properly. Even after compiling the results of your research, remember that every dog is different. His behavior will mostly be the result of genetics and how he’s raised. And don’t forget personality. Two sibling pure-breed pups raised in the same way by the same person may have totally different personalities. Even the best breeder cannot accurately predict how a puppy will turn out. But there are things you can do to increase your odds of finding a great dog.

11

Picking a Pooch

Most people pick dogs based on physical characteristics. A particular color, length of hair, type of ears, etc. But just as with people, you should look beyond the “pretty face.” The plain black pooch that others ignore might be the best choice. You want to a dog that likes you, is friendly (not shy or scared), and doesn’t mind being handled. Don’t pick a puppy that is less than eight weeks old. Some breeders will want you to reserve a puppy at a younger age. That benefits them, not you (and not the puppy). A very young puppy hasn’t yet developed a personality. You’ll have no way of knowing whether such a young puppy will be timid or friendly, for instance. And this is definitely

12

something you’ll want to know, especially if you’re paying big bucks for a pup that you’ll be sharing your life with for several years! If you’re getting a puppy from a breeder, be sure to “meet” the pup’s parents. Pay close attention to their behavior. Their behavior may give you a clue to the eventual disposition of the puppy. Don’t get a puppy from parent dogs who aren’t friendly. Look for puppies raised indoors around people instead of in an outdoor kennel. You want a puppy to share your home; so look for a puppy that has been raised in a home. If you’re getting an adult dog and can talk to the person giving him up, ask specific questions about its behavior. Avoid vague questions like: Is he friendly? Ask these instead: Does he like to be groomed and handled? Can you trim his nails? What happens if you take away his favorite toy? Is he good around other dogs (familiar and unfamiliar ones)? How does he react to strangers? Does he bark a lot at visitors? Has he ever growled, shown his teeth, or bitten anyone?

13

The Basis of Pet Success

Regardless of the many reasons for picking a particular pooch—whether pedigree, size, cuteness, or other traits you find appealing—the success of the relationship between you and your new friend will ultimately depend on how you raise and train him.

14

Pre-Training Basics

If you have a young puppy, we recommend that you wait until he’s at least 8 weeks old to begin formal training. Before you begin the formal training lessons with a dog of any age, please plan to follow these keys to success: 1. Be patient. Each dog is unique, and can only learn at his own pace. Some dogs learn quickly; others take more time. Patience is indeed a virtue when it comes to effective dog training! 2. Be kind. This goes hand-in-paw with “Be patient.” Don’t lose your temper if your dog doesn’t “get it” right away, or appears to be ignoring you. Please do not punish your dog for not learning quickly enough. As a matter of fact, don’t punish

15

your dog at all. (We’ll be teaching you effective ways to stop or prevent inappropriate behavior—without punishment.) 3. Be flexible. If your dog is struggling to learn, be willing to change your training routine. The location may be too distracting. The time of day may be too close (or far from) feeding time. The length of your training session may be too long (or too short). The training exercises may need to be broken down into smaller, simpler steps. Remember, each dog is unique. Be flexible and willing to do whatever you can to help your dog succeed. 4. Be generous. Be generous with your rewards and your time. Always reward your dog’s correct responses generously. Don’t be stingy with the treats—he’s worked hard and deserves a generous reward! And commit ample time to your training lessons. We’re all busy these days, but this is “quality time” for you and your dog. You’ll both enjoy and benefit from the lessons, so make sure your schedule is adjusted accordingly!

Rewards
One of the biggest keys to success with positive reinforcement training is rewarding your dog properly. This means giving him something he loves at exactly the right moment. Your first task is to figure out what kind of reward will best motivate your dog. Food Treats All dogs are unique individuals. Most dogs are motivated by food that tastes and smells good to them. Food treats can be very small, which is handy for keeping them in your pocket or a pouch to use during training—and important to maintaining your dog’s caloric intake to healthy levels. So that’s the form of reward we’ll be using throughout this training.

16

Be sure what you’re giving your dog is good for him. But don’t rely on the packing of store-bought treats to tell you “Your dog will love it!” Strong-smelling meat and cheese treats are usually winners, but many store-bought treats are made primarily of other ingredients. Your dog may not appreciate artificial colors, tastes or smells. Small morsels of cooked chicken are a popular home-made treat. But keep in mind that what motivates other dogs may not motivate yours. Experiment and find out what he loves to eat. Non-Edible Rewards What if your dog isn’t motivated by food (rare, but a possibility)? You’ll have to find something else that motivates him. You may think a couple of pats on the head are a great reward, but your dog may not. He might not even like it (most dogs don’t)! Try scratching his belly or some other form of petting. Again, experiment to find out what your dog loves. Another form of reward to consider is play. Tossing a ball, playing tug-of-war, or playfully chasing your dog for a few minutes may be his idea of heaven. The Best Reward Let your dog show you what he truly loves. He’ll do this with his reaction to the reward you offer. You just need to pay attention to how he responds. Just because he accepts a piece of kibble doesn’t necessarily mean he loves it. Watch him carefully when you’re giving him a treat, petting, or playing with him. If he looks away or walks away, he probably isn’t all that thrilled about what you’re offering. But if he gets excited, stays close and begs for more, he’s showing you that he loves it and will be willing to work for that reward in the future. For initial training, we highly recommend using a food treat as the reward. It’s the easiest to work with and gets the fastest results…just make sure your dog really likes it!

Timing
After you figure out the form of reward, the second key to positive reinforcement is timing. This is critical during early training: you must give the reward immediately after your dog performs the correct action. This means within half-a-second! Your response to his correct action must be clear and it must be instant. If you pause in stunned amazement that he actually did something right, then snap out of it and give him a treat several seconds later, you’ve blown it. You must train yourself to deliver instant gratification to your dog. Do this consistently, and you’ll be amazed at how quickly your dog learns. Here’s another important tip about timing: don’t make your training lessons too long. Like humans, dogs can become bored by repetition. Bored students don’t learn very well. So to keep the training sessions effective, don’t make them outlast your dog’s attention span. Each dog is different, so you’ll need to be alert and notice when his attention starts wandering. Try for a 10-minute session and see how that goes. Shorten

18

it if necessary. Don’t lengthen it to more than 15 minutes. Repeating a short session two or three times a day will be much more effective than having one long session each day.

Primary and Secondary Reinforcements
The instant reward you and your dog choose will be your primary reinforcer. A primary reinforcer is something your dog inherently loves. In other words, he was born loving it (treats, tummy rubs). Another form of reward is known as a secondary reinforcer. A secondary reinforcer is something your dog must learn to love and be motivated by. Praise is an excellent example. Puppies are not born loving a phrase such as “Good girl!” After all, it’s just noise to them. They must learn to associate that noise with love. A popular form of secondary reinforcement is clicker training. A clicker is a handheld device that makes a distinctive clicking sound. That sound is basically a substitute for verbal praise. When used properly, your dog will learn to associate the clicking sound with love. We prefer using verbal praise versus a clicker, simply because your voice is something you’ll always have with you. If you prefer to use a clicker, just remember to mentally substitute “click” when the lessons say verbal praise or “Good!”

Consistency is Key
Regardless of whether you use your voice or a clicker, the most effective way to train your dog is to use a combination of primary and secondary reinforcers that are consistent. If you’ll use your voice instead of a clicker, choose a phrase and use it exactly and consistently. Dogs are not people, remember? Words are just noise to them. They have no idea that “Good girl,” “Great job,” “Way to go Molly” or other phrases all mean they did the right thing. Pick your praise phrase, and make sure you (and others in your family) use that exact phrase or word every single time.

19

Then, several times a day, say your praise word or phrase and immediately give your dog the primary reinforcer (such as the treat you know he loves). Do about five repetitions, two or three times a day, for two days. You can also use your praise word or phrase when rubbing her belly, when she’s eating his dinner, or any other time you’re sure she’s enjoying something she loves. Within a few days, she’ll learn to love the secondary reinforcer (the praise phrase or word) and will be eager to hear you say it. (Throughout the training course we’ll use the example of “Good,” but substitute your own choice of secondary reinforcer. Remember to use it—and only it—consistently.) During early training, the combination of the primary and secondary reinforcers will be extremely powerful and effective… more so than using either form of motivation alone. Treats Won’t be Needed Forever Don’t worry that you’ll have to carry treats around in your pocket all the time to get your dog to behave. As your dog learns, her obedience will eventually become habitual. You won’t need to consistently use treats or other primary reinforcers for those behaviors beyond that point. (You’ll need to use them consistently whenever teaching something new, though.) It will always be a good idea to continue using the secondary reinforcer (“Good!” or whatever). You’re basically thanking your dog for doing what you asked… simple common courtesy is always a good thing! We’ll tell you when you can start decreasing the use of treats or other primary reinforcers. But for now, and whenever you’re teaching your dog something new, be sure to use both forms of positive reinforcements as instructed. OK, now that you know the basics of rewards and timing, you’re ready to begin training your best friend!

Housebreaking Breakthroughs

Successful housebreaking is, by far, the most important element of a loving, lifelong relationship between you and your dog. If you don’t teach your new best friend not to pee and poop in your house, he won’t be your friend for long! Fortunately, housebreaking a puppy (or adult dog) isn’t complicated. All you have to do is prevent peeing and pooping in the house, and reward peeing and pooping outside. While putting this simple concept into practice isn’t difficult, it does require your diligence, dedication, and patience. But the rewards are definitely worth the effort! In this report, we’ll provide some general information about dogs on which our housebreaking techniques are based, explain the benefits of crate training, and then give you the step-by-step process for housebreaking your dog.

21

Five Facts
Here are five facts that will guide your housebreaking training: Fact 1: Adult dogs can be housebroken the same as puppies. If you adopt an adult dog, you may not have to worry about housebreaking if he has already been properly trained. Dogs—even the smartest ones—do not naturally know it’s wrong to go potty indoors. They must be trained, and most adult dogs are. But you can’t assume this is the case. If he was always kept outdoors, raised in a cage at a puppy mill, or improperly trained by a previous owner, you will need to start fresh and housebreak him using the same basic techniques as you would for a puppy. Adult dogs don’t have to go as often as puppies, though, which will make the training much easier for you. (On the other hand, adult accidents will create bigger messes!) Fact 2: Puppies have limited bladder & bowel control.

22

A puppy younger than 20 weeks old will need to go potty once every hour when awake. A very young puppy (under 12 weeks old) will need to go more often—every 30 minutes or even more frequently. For an older puppy, a general rule for determining the number of hours he can go without going potty is to take his age in months and add one. So a four-month-old could hold it for about five hours. Small breeds can’t hold it as long; large breeds can hold it a bit longer. Remember, this is a general rule; your puppy’s control may vary. When sleeping, puppies can wait longer. But don’t think a puppy who can hold it for 6 hours while sleeping can hold it that long while awake. He can’t. Fact 3: Dogs like to sleep in a clean area. If given a choice, dogs, like people, will never sleep in an area that is soiled with pee or poop. In the wild, “dogs” (wolves, coyotes, foxes, etc.) sleep in a den and go outside to relieve themselves. Their pups learn to do the same. Because dogs will try their best not to soil their sleeping area, your puppy is less likely to pee or poop in a small “den.” Confining him to that “den” whenever you can’t watch him will guarantee he doesn’t get a chance to begin the bad habit of going anywhere else in your house. Fact 4: Dogs do best when kept to a routine schedule. Feeding your dog on a set schedule will help him to go potty on a regular schedule. If you let your dog eat and drink whenever he wants, you’ll be less able to predict when he’ll need to go out. Take him out on a regular schedule, too! Fact 5: Punishing a dog after he has an accident in the house is pointless, and may do more harm than good. Your dog will not understand that you are upset about something that happened in the past—even if it was just a minute or two ago. He will think he’s in trouble for what he’s doing at the instant you discover the mess and go ballistic… whether he’s happily

23

coming up to greet you or sitting quietly. This, obviously, is the wrong message to give your dog.

Common Scents

Photo Credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/flattop341

A dog relies on his nose and scent to find “the bathroom.” If a dog has gone potty in your house before, this will leave behind a chemical scent that says “this is the potty place!” This scent will be hard for your dog to resist. That’s why you should make sure there is no odor of urine or feces in the house before beginning to housebreak a new dog or puppy. Do not use a cleaning solution that contains vinegar or ammonia (the scent is too close to urine scent). You can use baking soda or club soda… or purchase special odoreliminating cleaners at a pet supply store.

24

Equally important to cleaning up the scent of past mistakes is marking rooms with the scent of your happy “pack.” A dog will be reluctant to go potty where he and his pack (you and your family) live. That’s why an unhousebroken dog who can’t get outside will often run to a rarely used area of the house, such as a guest room, to go potty. Once you have removed the scent of urine or feces, spend time in each room with your dog (especially the rooms you rarely use). Sit on the floor and play with your dog in each room for several minutes each day. Soon the room will be marked with a scent that says to your dog, “this is a no-potty zone!” It will be difficult to mark every area of your house this way, and even if you could, this is more of a passive deterrent than a foolproof method to prevent your dog from going potty indoors; additional action is needed, especially for a puppy.

Crate Training and Housebreaking Go Hand-in-Paw
If your puppy is free to run all over the house, he’ll go potty whenever he gets the urge instead of learning to hold it. You can’t watch him closely enough all the time to prevent this. So set him up for success instead of failure. Remember Fact 3: Dogs Like to Sleep in a Clean Area. By confining your puppy (or dog) to a “den,” you will inhibit him from peeing or pooping (teach him to hold it), since he won’t want to soil his sleeping area. You’ll also be able to accurately predict when he needs to go potty: immediately after being released from confinement.

25

We recommend you create a cozy den for your puppy out of a dog crate.

Make sure the crate is big enough for your puppy or dog to be able to stand up, turn around, and lie on his side—but not so big that it gives him room to pee or poop in there without lying in it. Line the crate with a towel you’ve used or a t-shirt you’ve worn (so your scent is on it). Make the crate comfortable for your puppy. Place the crate in a quiet area, away from distractions (not too close to a window or in a high traffic area of your house), but not away from his “pack” (you and your family). Some people choose to put the crate in their bedroom, but this may interrupt your sleep as the puppy will likely whine (and/or bark) the first few nights. Before confining your puppy to his crate, you first need to teach him to enjoy being in it. Say “crate” and toss a few treats into the crate and see if he goes in to get them. Praise

26

him if he goes inside. If he doesn’t go inside, put the treats on the lip/entrance of the crate, instead. Gradually move treats farther into the crate until he goes all the way inside to get them. Do not close the door; let him go in and out as he pleases. Make it a fun game by tossing treats into the crate a few times in a row, off and on throughout the day. Say “crate” whenever you want him to go in, and praise him when he does. After he appears comfortable with the crate and eagerly runs in to get the treats, shut the door for a second after he goes in… then open it and let him out. Do that a few times. Then try shutting the door and leaving it shut as you feed him a few treats through the door. Then let him out. The next step is to stuff a hollow chew toy (such as a Kong®) with something delicious. Let your puppy sniff the stuffed chew toy and then place it in the crate. Shut the door with your puppy on the outside. Usually it takes just a few seconds for your puppy to beg you to open the door and let him inside. Say “crate,” let him into the crate, praise him for going inside, and shut the door. Once he’s busy licking the treat out of the chew toy, walk away. Return before he finishes licking all the goodies out of the toy, and open the door. Don’t let him take the chew toy out of the crate; take it from him. Next, tie the freshly stuffed chew toy to the inside of the crate and leave the door open. Your puppy can then choose whether he wants to remain outside or go into his crate and start licking the treat from his chew toy. Most puppies choose to rest happily inside the crate and work on the stuffed chew toy. He may even fall asleep in there when he’s done. Close the door. Speaking of sleeping, you’ll also want to put your puppy in the crate when he’s sleepy. Encourage him to get into his crate with treats and by saying “crate” when you notice he’s about to fall asleep. Close the door after he goes in. If you find him already asleep, pick him up and put him inside, as gently as you can. Close the door.

27

With several instances of this pre-conditioning, some puppies will quickly accept being confined in their crate at night; others will whine or bark like mad to be let out. Sometimes putting a cover over the crate will help your puppy to settle down and go to sleep. Ignore a puppy’s immediate whining and barking to be let out, otherwise you’ll teach him that whining and barking is the key to getting what he wants (very bad idea). Most puppies will settle down after a few minutes and go to sleep. If he starts whining after being quiet for a while, he may need to go potty. You should take him outside, but don’t let him out of the crate as he’s whining. Wait a moment to see if his whining pauses, and then quickly open the door and take him outside. If he doesn’t pause on his own, make some sort of noise that will cause him to stop whining and listen. Then get him out right away before he starts whining again. Use the crate at night and during the day whenever you’re unable to watch your puppy or have him outside. Do not use the crate as “punishment.” If you scold your puppy and then lock him in the crate, he’ll associate the crate with being punished. You want him to think of his crate as his comfortable den—not a jail cell. Follow these steps, and after just a few days your puppy will consider the crate to be his safe, cozy den and will happily rest inside.

It’s All in the Timing
Successful housebreaking is all about timing. Your goal is to have your puppy in the right place (outside) at the right time (when he needs to go); and avoid having him in the wrong place (inside) at the wrong time (when he needs to go). This will be much easier when you’re able to predict when your puppy needs to go. Keep Fact 2: Puppies Have Limited Bladder & Bowel Control, in mind.

Usually, puppies need to pee right after waking up from a nap, and poop within a couple of minutes of that. If you don’t want to wait around for your puppy to wake up and do his business, you can wake him up when you are ready and the time is right. Another critical element of timing is that you immediately reward your puppy for doing the right thing (we covered this in our Pre-Training Basics report). When your puppy goes potty when and where you want, your immediate and lavish rewards (praise and yummy treats) will teach him to repeat this correct behavior.

Step-By-Step Housebreaking Process

A new puppy (or dog) that is not housebroken should be restricted to one of these three situations at all times: 1. 2. 3. Inside under your constant and attentive supervision. Outside with you. Confined to his crate/den.

Situation 3 is where your puppy should spend most of his time during the housebreaking process.

30

Did you notice that we did NOT include a situation where you leave your dog outside all the time? Many people mistakenly think that puppies kept outside will be less trouble— after all, they won’t be peeing and pooping in your house, and they won’t need your constant supervision, right? But here is the reality: puppies left outdoors and unsupervised for long periods of time seldom become housebroken. They tend to bark, chew, dig, and escape from your yard. Outdoor puppies also become so excited on the rare occasions when they are allowed indoors (excited puppies tend to pee without warning), that eventually they are no longer allowed inside at all. We don’t want that. You shouldn’t want that. Here’s how to housebreak your four-legged friend: 1. Determine where you want your dog to go potty. It’s best to pick a doggy toilet area that’s relatively close to the door, so you and your dog don’t have too far to go when he’s gotta go. Give the location some thought, because after he’s trained, your dog will continue to use this place as his toilet. This is convenient for clean-up time, especially if you have a large yard—and your family won’t have to be wary of little “landmines” when playing outside in the non-doggy-toilet areas. 2. Know when your puppy needs to go. Until your puppy is trained to tell you when he needs to go outside (don’t worry, that will eventually happen), you have to be an expert at deducing this. Sometimes a puppy will need to go within 5 minutes of going! Don’t assume you don’t have to watch him just because he’s just gone potty. Here’s when you should take a puppy out to go:


Immediately after he wakes up. Immediately after letting him out of his crate/den. Every 30 to 60 minutes while he’s awake, based on his age (see Fact 2). After he eats or drinks.







31



When he’s been doing something for a while (like chewing on a toy), and then gets up and starts looking around.



When he starts sniffing the floor. When he goes to an area where he’s gone potty before. When he’s running around and excited more than usual. When he’s look at or wandering near the door. When he’s pacing, whining, or starts to squat (duh!). Note: Male puppies squat to pee just like female puppies (versus lifting a leg) until they are 4-9 months old.

3. Keep your puppy under your constant and attentive supervision, or confined to his crate, when indoors. It only takes a couple of seconds for a puppy to squat and pee, so you must watch him very closely. Don’t stare at him (it’ll make him nervous), but keep an eye on him at all times when he’s out of his crate. This will be easier if you limit his movements, either by keeping him on a leash or by restricting him to one or two rooms. Don’t think you can watch TV, wash the dishes, or do something else and still watch your puppy. If you become distracted or preoccupied, accidents will happen and this will make housebreaking your puppy a longer, more difficult task. It’s your responsibility to take him outside when he needs to go. Accidents will be your fault, not your dog’s. 4. Take your dog to his designated toilet area every hour or whenever he needs to go (see Step 2), whichever is less, and teach him to go on command.


Every hour, fill your pocket with treats, release your pup from his crate and quickly take him outside to the designated toilet area. Encourage him to go quickly by enthusiastically calling “Outside, outside, outside!” (If you take your time, he may pee or poop en route. Also, hurrying him along tends to jiggle his bowels and bladder so that he really wants to go the moment you let him stand still and sniff his toilet area.)

32

Take your dog out every hour even if he’s old enough to hold it for longer than that. This practice is as much to train your dog—in the shortest time possible—to use the designated toilet area and go on command as it is for getting him outside in time to pee or poop!


Use a leash (even if you have a fenced yard) to lead him to the correct place. This will also get him used to going potty while on the leash.



Stand quietly (don’t stare at him) and wait until he begins to go. (If he stares at you instead of doing his business because he smells treats in your pocket, just look away and pretend to ignore him; eventually he’ll start sniffing and preparing to go.) When he does start to go, quietly (so you don’t startle him) say “go potty.” (You can choose another cue. Make it something you wouldn’t mind saying in public. Once you decide, be sure that you and your family use only this word/phrase, and use it every time he goes.)



After your dog is finished, immediately give him a generous amount of tasty treats and lots of enthusiastic praise. Lavish rewards mean quicker results!

These steps are essential. If you just open the door and let your dog run out by himself to go potty, then give him a treat when he comes back to the house, his housebreaking will take longer and be less successful. Your dog will think he’s getting the reward for coming back to the house (versus going potty), and you’ll miss the opportunity to train him to go on command.

33

5. Spend time playing with or training your puppy, or take him for a nice walk (if he’s old enough). If you take him outside to go, and then quickly bring him back in and ignore him after he does so, he’ll learn that "after I go, my fun ends!" Consequently, he may become reluctant to go potty when he’s outside (and end up going inside when he can no longer hold it). It is much better to praise your puppy for going potty and then take him for a walk as an extra reward for a “job well done.” This extra reward will also encourage him to go potty more quickly.

34

What if he doesn't go potty when you take him outside?

If your puppy enjoys the great outdoors but doesn’t go potty within a few minutes, take him back inside, put him in his crate, and try again in 10 minutes or so. Repeat the process until he does go. Your puppy will learn that if he doesn’t go potty when you take him outside to do so, he’ll be confined to his crate again (no go, no freedom). Eventually he will go in the appropriate place at the appropriate time, and you will be able to give him appropriate rewards! What about putting down newspapers? Allowing a puppy to go potty on newspapers or some other kind of potty pad/material is a mistake. He will earn that he can go potty indoors, whenever he wants, as long as it’s on the paper. He will never learn to hold it; he may never be truly housebroken.

35

Control what goes in so you can predict when it will come out.

What goes into a puppy will come out with predictable timing (depending on the age and size of your dog). Feeding your dog on a set schedule will help him to go potty on a regular schedule. Generally, a puppy will need to go potty about 15 minutes after eating or drinking. If you let your dog eat and drink whenever he wants, you’ll be less able to predict when he’ll need to go out. Feed your puppy at the same time each day. Leave the food there for ten minutes or so, then pick it up and put it away if he hasn’t finished it. A puppy younger than three months should be fed three times a day; older puppies and dogs should be fed twice a day. Do not leave water out all day and night; put it down at regular intervals and pay attention to how much he drinks. Don’t let him drink water after 7 p.m. Feeding dry food is better than canned food which contains more liquid.

36

Handling Inevitable Accidents
If you follow the steps in this report, you’ll have fewer accidents—but they will happen. Expect them. Don’t get upset at your dog when an accident happens. Instead, try to determine why it happened. Did you get distracted when you should’ve been watching him? Did you forget to take him out at the right time? Figure out what you did wrong, so it doesn’t happen again. Despite what many people believe, dogs do not intentionally pee or poop in your house because they are angry, lonely, or want to “get back at you” for something. Dogs don’t think of pee or poop as something “nasty” to be used out of spite. And the so-called look of “guilt” or cowering in “shame” when you scold him is actually your dog’s way of showing appeasement and submitting to your obvious anger. If you do not actually catch your puppy in the act, do nothing (except clean it up). Do not—repeat—do not rub his nose in it, hit him, yell at him, shake him, or punish him in any way. Dogs don’t think about time the way humans do. Your dog will not understand that you are upset about something that happened in the past—even if it was just a minute or two ago. He will think he’s in trouble for whatever he’s doing at the instant you discover the mess and go ballistic… whether he’s happily coming up to greet you or sitting quietly. What if you do catch him in the act? If you catch your dog squatting and about to go potty inside the house, make a sudden, surprising sound—such as slapping the wall—not to scare him, but to get his attention so that he momentarily stops what he’s doing. Then urgently encourage your puppy to run outside with you. “Outside, outside, outside!” And finally, reward your puppy lavishly for going potty in the right place.

37

In any case, be sure to clean up all accidents quickly and thoroughly. You must eliminate any lingering scent so it doesn’t invite your puppy back for a repeat performance.

How Long Before He’s Housebroken?
When can you safely start leaving your puppy or dog alone in the house for a while? It depends on many things, including his age, size and—most importantly—your diligence in training him! In general, if you follow these housebreaking guidelines, your dog should be making good progress within two months. But some dogs learn quickly while others take more time. Gradually increase the amount of time you allow your puppy to be indoors, out of the crate, and monitor his progress. Adult dogs generally need to go out at least once every four hours—first thing in the morning, around midday, late in the afternoon, and before going to sleep for the night. If you can’t get be home to let your puppy or dog out often enough, consider hiring a pet sitter. Expect accidents and set backs; they’re normal. Continue following the above steps and be patient.

Be Alert for Special Circumstances
There are a few reasons why it might be particularly difficult to housebreak a dog. Dogs who were raised in puppy mills or pet stores, or who were regularly confined without the opportunity to go potty away from their sleeping area, will take longer to housebreak and require more patience and understanding from you.

38

Sudden changes in dog food brands or overindulgence in treats or table scraps can cause diarrhea. There may be physical reasons, such as a urinary infection. Be sure to get your dog checked thoroughly by your vet.

In Summary
If you’re housebreaking a puppy, remember he doesn’t know anything yet. If you’re housebreaking an adult dog, there may be some old habits he has to “unlearn” first. Be patient, be consistent, be encouraging. A few weeks of dedicated effort on your part will result in a lifetime of clean floors and a beautiful relationship with your dog!

Lesson 1: Teaching Your Dog His Name

Photo Credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/silance/

Even if your dog already knows his name, please don’t skip this lesson. We promise you’ll learn something! The first thing we all teach our dogs, even before we realize we’re doing any training, is that when we make a certain specific sound, we want their attention. This “sound” is their name. That’s all it is, and that’s all it should be used for. Many dog owners tend to think of their dog’s name as more than that. They use it as a “catch-all” command with multiple definitions that vary depending on what they want their dog to do at the moment: “Max!” (Meaning “Come here!”); “Max!” (Meaning “Stop that!”); “Max!” (Meaning “Get down!”); “Max!” (Meaning “Stop barking!”); “Max!” (Meaning “Don’t eat that cat poop!). You get the idea. You’re dog may be the smartest dog in the world, but he is not a mind reader.

40

You shouldn’t use your dog’s name any differently than a child’s name. For example, if you call a child’s name, he may acknowledge that he hears you (if you’re lucky), but his likely response will be to call back, “What?” He probably won’t even look up from the video game or whatever else he was doing when you called his name. You’ll need to follow up with an instruction; tell him what you want: “Bobby! Stop playing that game and do your homework!” (Then he may or may not do as you ask, depending on how well he’s been trained.)  The point is, plan to use your dog’s name in the same way—to get his attention. Period. Then use other sounds (commands) and actions to tell or show him what you want him to do. Important: Even after your dog learns his name, he may continue doing whatever he was doing when he hears you use it (just like Bobby). Don’t get upset or impatient. And don’t repeat his name: “Max… Max!... MAX!!!” Doing this will only teach your dog to ignore you until he hears his name over and over. We’ll give you better solutions. So let’s get on with the lesson. Lesson 1: Teaching Your Dog His Name Read this lesson first, and then practice it with your dog. 1. First, load up your pocket (or a bag or pouch) with 20 or so treats. 2. Take your dog to an area where there won’t be a lot of distractions. 3. Wait for your dog to look at something other than you, then say his name (once!). 4. When he looks at you, immediately give him a treat and say “Good!” (Or whatever you’ve chosen as the primary reinforcer, phrase or clicker. We’re going to just use “Good!” in our training examples.) 5. Now move a few steps to another location and again wait for your dog to be looking away from you. 6. Say your dog’s name again and immediately reward him again with the treat and praise when he looks at you. 7. Repeat this process five times. If your dog was particularly distracted before responding to his name, give him extra praise and treats.

41

If your dog doesn’t do what you want If you say his name and he doesn’t look at you, he may be too distracted. Move him a few paces to a different location and try again. Say his name. Use an enthusiastic tone of voice. Give immediate rewards if he looks at you. If he still doesn’t respond to his name, clap your hands, whistle or make some other attention-getting sound. When he looks, say his name again and immediately give the rewards. Do this as a last resort. You want him to learn to respond to his name, not the other sounds. [Note: If your dog does not show any response to those attention-getting sounds, please have his hearing checked. Seriously. Some breeds, such as Dalmatians, are prone to hearing problems. A dog owner who thinks the dog is too dumb to learn is sometimes surprised to learn the dog is actually deaf!] Another tactic: put the treat in your hand and let your dog sniff your closed fist so he’ll know it’s there. Pull your hand away and wait until your dog looks away from you. Say his name and immediately reward his response. If your dog continues to ignore his name after several attempts, try moving to a less distracting location. (Distractions include smells, not just sights and sounds.) Keep trying, be patient, and remember not to repeat his name. Give immediate rewards when he responds. This Week’s Homework Practice this lesson. During this week, you’ll be training yourself as well as your dog. The important lesson for you: Learn to say your dog’s name only once. This is difficult for most people. We rely on verbal communication. Dogs don’t. So you’ll have to train yourself not to do what may come naturally: repeating yourself until you get a response. Practice this lesson several times each day during the week. Vary the time of day and location (both inside and outside). Do not, however, move to areas with greater distractions to challenge your dog with higher degrees of difficulty, even if he is a fast learner. The Happy Mutt Training System works best when you build on a strong foundation of success and progress slowly, one step at a time. Do five repetitions during each lesson.

42

Concentrate on saying your dog’s name only once. Remember: do not use your dog’s name as a “catch-all” command with multiple definitions. As our training progresses, you’ll learn that each desired action will have it’s own separate command (and it won’t be your dog’s name). In Addition to Practicing This Lesson…


Learn the type of reward that is the best motivator for your dog. Food treats, such as small pieces of cooked chicken, can be kept fresh by placing them in sealable plastic bags and storing them in the refrigerator. Focus on positive reinforcement. You’ll be teaching your dog that listening to you and learning are fun. Your goal is to have a happy student, eager for each lesson. Use treats your dog loves most, and give them immediately as instant reinforcers. Remember to use a combination of primary (treats) and secondary (praise or clicker) reinforcers together. When your dog responds correctly, immediately give the treat and say “Good!” Always use the same praise word/phrase. Have fun playing with your dog! Don’t focus all your time together on training. Spend lots of quality time just enjoying each other’s company.

Lesson 2: Teaching Your Dog to Sit

Photo Credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/exfordy/

Even if your dog already knows how to sit on verbal command, please don’t skip this lesson. We promise she’ll begin to learn something new! The method you’ll use to teach your dog to sit is known as the “lure and reward” method. You’ll lure your dog into a sitting position, then immediately reward her. It’s a popular method because it’s effective, easy for you to do, and easy for your dog to learn. A great “side-effect” of this method is that it allows a natural motion to become a visual cue… a form of sign language for your dog. This is so cool! Dogs are very visual and they often respond to body motions better than they do to sounds. (You’ll need to keep this in mind as sometimes it can work against you: to your dog, your voice may be saying one thing while your body language is saying the opposite. In dog communication, body language trumps verbal language every time. We’ll cover this in more detail later.) Imagine being able to use hand signals as commands for your dog

44

when you’re on the phone, or too far away for your dog to hear you. It’s definitely something worth pursuing. So let’s get on with the lesson. Lesson 2: Teaching Your Dog to Sit Read this lesson first, and then practice it with your dog. 1. Load up your pocket (or a bag or pouch) with treats. 2. Take your dog to an area where there won’t be a lot of distractions. 3. While your dog is standing, put a treat in your hand, and move your hand to within an inch or so of your dog’s nose. Make sure she smells the treat hidden in your hand and is focusing her attention on it. 4. Move your hand slowly backward, about an inch over her head, between her ears, toward her tail. Keep your hand low over her head so she doesn’t try to leap up to get the treat. 5. As your dog watches your hand with the treat move just above her head, she will raise her chin up—and her butt will plop down into a sitting position. When that happens, immediately give her the treat and say “Good!” 6. Now move a few steps away. Get your dog to stand and follow you. 7. Repeat Steps 3, 4 and 5. 8. Did you notice you haven’t told her to “Sit” yet? Don’t say that until you can get her to sit consistently by moving your treat-filled hand over her head, toward her tail. Once you’re sure she’s going to do this properly the next time you do that, say “Sit” a split second before you start moving your hand. When she sits, immediately reward her with the treat and “Good!” 9. Repeat this process five times, saying “Sit” just before she does so. If your dog doesn’t do what you want If your dog backs up instead of sitting down as you move your treat-filled hand over her head and toward her tail, position her so that she’s facing out of a corner and cannot back up without hitting the wall.

45

This Week’s Homework Practice this lesson two or three times each day during the week. Vary the time of day and location. Do no more than five repetitions during each lesson. Reduce the number of repetitions as your dog learns… eventually asking her to sit just once, two or three times a day. Dogs tend to learn to sit quickly, and repeating the lesson too often will only make them bored (remember, we don’t want bored students). After a few of days of successful “Sit” practice, start to focus a bit on your hand movement. As you move your treat-filled hand over your dog’s head and toward her tail, begin to emphasize an upward sweep of your hand… less over her head, more in an upward curve toward your body. (Don’t go too far with this just yet; we’ll continue working on it in next week’s lesson.) In Addition to Practicing This Lesson…


Reinforce Lesson 1, Teaching Your Dog Her Name: Continue teaching your dog her name (as you learned last week) at various times throughout the week. Use a training area that is slightly more distracting than last week. Remember to say your dog’s name only once, and wait for her to respond before giving the rewards. Have fun playing with your dog! Don’t focus all your time together on training. Spend lots of quality time just enjoying each other’s company.

Lesson 3: Teaching Your Dog to Come When Called

Photo Credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/brianteutsch/

Teaching your dog to come when called is one of the most valuable lessons in this training course. It can literally save your dog’s life. A dog that comes when called can be kept away from traffic or other dangers. You can let him run at the dog park, in the woods or along the beach knowing that when you call him back, he’ll come. This training therefore gives you both more freedom. But teaching your dog to come when called is also one of the most difficult lessons—for you, not your dog. You’ll need to control your normal human tendencies and pay close attention to your body language. What you’ll be learning to do is counter-intuitive to humans, but very effective. The end result—a dog that comes when you call him, every single time—will be well worth the effort.

47

Before we begin, you need to decide what command you’ll use. Give this some thought, because you’ll need to use it each and every time, without change. Consistency is key with verbal commands. You can’t expect your dog to learn that “Come,” “Come here,” “Get over here,” “Hey, come on,” and “Max, get your butt over here right now!” all mean the same thing. The simplest, of course, is “Come!” Three things during this training are going to be different from other lessons. First, your tone of voice. It should be upbeat and enthusiastic. Think of yourself as an excited coach yelling encouragements to a player running down the field, versus calmly telling the player what to do. Second, repetition of the verbal command is good for this particular training, because a series of short, enthusiastic sounds works best when getting your dog to move quickly. Imagine a coach yelling “Go! Go! Go!” Also, clapping while giving the command is extremely effective. Third, you’ll need to use your entire body (not just your voice) to get your dog to do what you want. Most people tend to stand facing their dog, or even step towards him, when they want him to come. That’s the opposite of what you should do. To get your dog to come, you’ll need to turn and move away from him as you call him. This will be the hardest trick for you to learn, but you’ll be amazed at how well it works! Think of yourself as “pulling” your dog toward you. When pulling something heavy on the end of a rope, you can stand facing it and pull it towards you with just your arms… or you can do it the easy and much more effective way—by turning, putting the rope over your shoulder, and walking away from the object, pulling it behind you. Here’s another tip: most dogs want to go where their owners go. They figure out where we’re about to go by looking at our feet. That’s why you’ll be turning and moving away from your dog to get him to come to you. One more thing before we begin. It is very important during this initial training that your dog learns to love coming to you. As mentioned earlier in this course, your primary reinforcer (such as the treat) must be something your dog loves—not just accepts, but really loves. Your tone of voice when giving praise must be encouraging and happy, too. Have you ever seen someone yelling at their dog that got loose? Typically they lose patience quickly and switch from a cajoling voice to a stern, angry yell if the dog doesn’t come immediately. Think about that. Would you want to run towards anger? Of course not! Remember, your goal is to make your dog very happy to run to you when you call. So be very careful to not patience during this lesson, keep your voice happy and enthusiastic, and give tons of praise when your dog does the right thing. Now (finally), let’s get on with the lesson!

48

Lesson 3: Teaching Your Dog to Come when Called Read this lesson first, and then practice it with your dog. 1. Load up your pocket (or a bag or pouch) with treats. You’ll need more than usual for this lesson. 2. Take your dog to an area where there won’t be a lot of distractions. 3. Move about 10 feet away from your dog as he’s not paying attention to you. 4. Enthusiastically call out your dog’s name, followed by the come command: “Come! Come! Come!” Do this while turning sideways (don’t turn your back, you need to watch him closely), and start clapping as you begin to run away from your dog. 4. As soon as he moves in your direction, call out your praise (“Good!”) and keep going. 5. Slow down and let your dog catch up to you; then stop and immediately give him a handful of treats and lots of enthusiastic praise—like coming to you was the best thing in the world! Important: This method reinforces your dog’s actions twice—first for diverting his attention from whatever he’s doing (Step 4), and second when he reaches you (Step 5). Step 4 is just as important as Step 5. Be very good and consistent about praising your dog the instant he turns his attention to you. Considering how many smelly distractions there are in your dog’s world, getting him to stop whatever he’s doing and look at you really is quite amazing, and you need to show your appreciation. Give your praise (“Good!”) immediately when he looks at you and starts to move in your direction. And be sure that with Step 5, you give the treat immediately when he reaches you. Do NOT wait because he may sit down. If you give him the treat after he sits, he’ll think sitting was the action that’s being rewarded, not coming to you. 6. Walk about ten steps away from your dog and wait for him to look away from you. 7. Repeat Steps 3, 4 and 5. 8. Repeat this process three times. If your dog doesn’t do what you want If your dog doesn’t come, he’s probably too distracted. That’s OK. Remember, he hasn’t yet learned that coming to you will make him happier than anything else he’s doing. So here’s what you do: go to him. (This is difficult for some people to do as they feel it is “giving in” to their dog. But please trust us… this is the right thing to do at this point of training your dog.) Let your dog know you have a treat in your hand, and use it to lure

49

him as you walk away, giving your come (“Come! Come! Come!”) command. Stop after a few steps and give him the treat. If the treat lure doesn’t work, put a leash on him and gently pull him along as you give your come command. Stop after a few steps and give him the treat. Remember to keep your tone of voice upbeat, enthusiastic and happy. This Week’s Homework Practice this lesson several times a day. Vary the time of day and location. Think of the training as a fun game for you and your dog. Remember to use the same come command every time, turn away from your dog, and clap while running away. Give instant praise when he turns his attention to you, and instant treats when he reaches you. Be aware of what your dog is doing when you call him to come to you. You want him to learn quickly and easily, so don’t call him when he’s focused on something else. Keep the degree of difficulty for this exercise as low as possible at this point. Use the command also when you know you’re dog will be coming to you automatically, such as when you put his food bowl down. Also remember the key to this lesson is to teach your dog that coming to you is a wonderful thing. So for now, do NOT use the come command to call him to you if the end result is something he won’t like, such as having his toenails trimmed. Instead, go to him, put on the leash, and lead him to where you need him to go. Keep your tone of voice upbeat, friendly, and encouraging, but be sure to avoid using the come command when your dog won’t like what happens afterwards. In Addition to Practicing This Lesson…


Reinforce Lesson 2, Teaching Your Dog to Sit. Continue teaching your dog to sit (as you learned last week) at various times throughout the week. Remember not to change your verbal command. If you started with “Sit,” do not say “Sit down” or anything else. After a few successful sessions with the basic lesson, during your next session, put your treat in your other hand (not the one that is moving over his head toward his tail). This will teach your dog that he’ll get a reward for doing the right thing (sitting) even when he can’t sniff the food. Remember to say “Sit” before moving your arm.

50

After a few successful sessions, during your next session, try saying the word alone, without moving your arm (or anything else). It may take him a few seconds longer to sit on just the verbal command, so wait until he does so before giving lots of praise and several treats. If your dog doesn’t sit on just the verbal command, resist the temptation to repeat the command. Instead, go back to using the arm motion with the verbal command. Don’t worry if he won’t respond to the verbal command without the arm motion at this point. When you feel your dog is ready to move on, during your next session, try teaching him to respond to the arm motion alone. Modify the arm movement somewhat, so it’s more of an upward motion out and back towards your chest than a movement over your dog’s head toward his tail. Use just the arm movement alone, without the verbal command. Give extra praise and treats to reward him if he sits. After he learns to respond to just the verbal command, and to just the visual command, alternate them (but not during the same session). Sometimes ask him to “Sit” verbally. Other times just use the arm movement. Give lots of praise for doing the right thing. Be patient; this alternating of verbal and visual commands is a bit complicated for your dog. Don’t switch commands during the same session. Go back to using the verbal command and arm motion together if he doesn’t respond to either alone. All dogs learn at different paces. Just keep working at it. Make sure there aren’t too many distractions. Give lots of praise for doing the right thing. Keep your practice sessions to no more than five repetitions per session.

Reinforce Lesson 1, Teaching Your Dog His Name: Continue teaching your dog his name at various times throughout the week, allowing the level of distraction to increase during your practice sessions. Remember to say your dog’s name only once, wait for him to look at you, then immediately give praise. Intermittent Reinforcement Begins When you’re confident your dog will respond to his name each time, you can begin “intermittent reinforcement.” Continue giving verbal praise, but back off on giving treats every time your dog responds correctly. Give treat rewards intermittently, at random. This gradual withdrawal of treats is an important step, so don’t skip it. (You can delay it another week, though, if your dog doesn’t yet respond consistently to his name.) Start using petting (make sure it’s the kind your dog likes—most dogs do NOT like pats on the head, for instance) and play as other forms of reward.

Lesson 4: Teaching Your Dog to Stay

Photo Credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/wigwamgirl/

It’s not easy for a dog who loves being with you to stay where she is while you walk away. But teaching your dog to stay has many benefits. For example, a dog that stays on command can be kept out of harm’s way when you need to run across the street. The stay command will also help your dog to learn patience and impulse control. A visual command to stay can help you keep your dog safe when you’re too far away for your voice to be heard, so we’ll incorporate a hand signal into this lesson. You’ll use two verbal commands for this lesson: a word to tell your dog to stay, and a different word to let her know it’s OK now to move (release her from the stay). As with all training, pick specific verbal commands and use them consistently. The obvious word for the stay command is “Stay.” (Don’t be tempted to lengthen that sometimes into “Stay there.”) The release command can be something like “Release” or

52

“Free” or “Okay.” Make sure it’s not a word you might use for another meaning in other circumstances (such as “Release” when you want your dog to let go of a toy). It’s probably best to use “Free,” as you’re not likely to use that for anything else. That’s the word we’ll use for this lesson. Teaching your dog to stay involves working with three elements: 1. Distance. Distance refers to how far you move away from your dog. 2. Time. Time refers to how long you want your dog to stay. 3. Distraction. Distraction refers to everything going on around your dog that is tempting her to get up. It’s best to begin with easy challenges for your dog in all three elements: short distance, short time, fewest distractions. Eventually we’ll work on each element separately, gradually increasing the degree of difficulty. Let’s get on with the lesson. Lesson 4: Teaching Your Dog to Stay Read this lesson first, and then practice it with your dog. 1. First, load up your pocket (or a bag or pouch) with treats. 2. Take your dog to an area where there won’t be a lot of distractions. 3. If you’re right-handed, put a treat in your left hand (vice versa if you’re left-handed; you want the treat in the hand you won’t be using for your hand signal). 4. Place yourself about two feet away from your dog. 5. Ask your dog to sit. As soon as she does, say “Stay” in a low, quiet voice and raise your hand, palm open and facing her, in the universal “Stop” hand signal. Look directly at your dog. Try not to move any other part of your body. 6. After a very brief pause of just 1 or 2 seconds, say “Good,” lean forward and give your dog the treat from your other hand. Important: Make sure to quickly move the treat all the way to her mouth so she’s not tempted to get up and move toward it. 7. While your dog is still eating her treat, release her by saying “Free” in a low, quiet voice, and lean back away from her.

53

8. Important: Let your dog get up or do whatever she wants, but do NOT praise or reward her for getting up. You want her to learn that the Stay action is the one that will reap the rewards. 9. Repeat Steps 4-8. Be sure you don’t allow more than a couple of seconds to go by before rewarding after giving the Stay command. 10. Repeat this process five times. If your dog doesn’t do what you want If your dog doesn’t stay still for a couple of seconds, she’s probably too distracted. Try moving to a different location, or waiting until she has less energy. Make sure she knows you have a treat in your hand. Keep your tone of voice low and quiet, letting it drop in pitch (versus going up, as if you’re asking a question). Make sure your hand motion is distinct and does not look like the arm motion you use during the Sit training. This Week’s Homework Practice this lesson several times a day, with fewer repetitions. Vary the time of day and location. Make sure there are as few distractions as possible. Remember to use the same commands (“Stay,” “Free”) every time, using a low, quiet tone of voice. Give instant praise and reward after just a couple of seconds by bringing the treat all the way to her mouth so she doesn’t move to get it. Do not be tempted to see if she’ll stay longer. Right now it’s very important to lay a solid foundation. Practice your “Stop sign” hand signal and make sure it’s different from your “Sit” motion. In Addition to Practicing This Lesson…


Reinforce Lesson 3, Teaching Your Dog to Come when Called. Continue teaching your dog to come when called. Practice in various locations that are free from distraction, at different times of the day.

54

Remember the priority is to teach her that coming to you is a wonderful thing that will make her very happy. Don’t use the come command when what you’ll do when she comes is something she won’t like. Resist the temptation to give the come (“Come! Come! Come!”) command more than once if your dog doesn’t respond. Instead, go to your dog and show her the treat in your hand. Give the verbal command, turn and move away while clapping. Be sure to praise (“Good!”) as soon as she looks at you, and then reinforce generously with treats when she reaches you.


Reinforce Lesson 2, Teaching Your Dog to Sit. Continue teaching your dog to sit at various times throughout the week. You can use a training area that is slightly more distracting than last week. After a few successes when using both the verbal command and arm motion together, try them separately. First by saying the word alone, without moving your arm (or anything else). After a few successes with that, try using the arm motion alone, without giving the verbal command, during your next session. Alternate these during practice sessions throughout the week… separately, not during the same session. Be sure to give lots of praise and several treats to reward the correct action. Intermittent Reinforcement Begins When you’re confident your dog will respond correctly when asked (verbally and via arm motion) to sit, you can begin “intermittent reinforcement” for this particular command. Continue giving verbal praise, but back off on giving treats every single time your dog sits on command. Give treat rewards intermittently, at random. This gradual withdrawal of treats is an important step, so don’t skip it. (You can delay it another week and continue with giving treats 100% of the time, though, if your dog doesn’t yet sit whenever asked to do so.) Start using petting (make sure it’s the kind your dog likes—most dogs do NOT like pats on the head, for instance) and play as other forms of reward. Always include the verbal praise.



Reinforce Lesson 1, Teaching Your Dog Her Name: By this time your dog should be responding to her name even when the level of distraction is high. If she does so consistently, you can stop practicing this lesson. Give yourself a treat! At the end of this week you’ll have been patiently being an excellent teacher for your dog for a full month! You’ve had to retrain yourself to focus on communicating in ways your dog understands, which may be contrary to what you’re used to. That’s hard work! So reward yourself for a job well done.



55

Go out to dinner, indulge in your favorite food treat, do whatever you consider a great reward. Seriously, please do this. You deserve it… and it will help reinforce your correct behavior! 

Lesson 5: Teaching Your Dog to Lie Down

Photo Credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pato_garza/

Why is it important to teach your dog to lie down on command? In a word: control. A dog that is lying down is not chasing a cat, barking at other dogs, getting under your feet while you’re trying to cook dinner, or otherwise being a pain in the neck when you want peace and quiet. Sometimes a dog, like a five-year-old child on a sugar rush, can get so wound up and full of energy they can get themselves into trouble. They need to calm down. A dog that will happily lie down when you ask him to will calm down, and is less likely to get himself (or his owner) into trouble. This lesson uses methods similar to the ones you used when teaching your dog to sit. But it may take your dog a bit longer to learn to lie down on command than it did to sit on command. Lying down, after all, takes a bit more effort… and being asked to lie

56

down when you’re not even tired seems kind of silly, even to a dog. So it may take longer, but don’t get impatient or discouraged. As with other lessons, you need to decide what command you’ll use. Remember, consistency is key with verbal commands; one word or phrase, one meaning. If you use “Down” for this lesson, you can’t use “Down” to also mean “Get off the couch” or “Stop jumping on Aunt Mavis!” Many trainers use “lie down,” but that’s a bit too close to “get down.” To make it easier on your dog, we recommend a totally different-sounding word: “Rest.” We’ll use that word in our training lessons. So let’s get on with the lesson. Lesson 5: Teaching Your Dog to Lie Down Read this lesson first, and then practice it with your dog. 1. Load up your pocket (or a bag or pouch) with treats. 2. Take your dog to an area where there won’t be a lot of distractions. 3. Put a treat in your hand and ask your dog to sit. 4. With your dog sitting and you squatting or sitting next to him, hold your hand with the treat about an inch from his nose and slowly move your hand straight down to the ground. Important: move your hand straight down, right below your dog’s nose, being very careful not to move it away from him as this will cause him to get up and move toward it. We don’t want that. (If that happens, just start over.) 5. Your dog should follow the treat down with his nose, and then lie down completely. You may need to hold the treat on the ground for a few seconds before he lies down. It may also help to tap the ground with your other hand. Be patient. 6. As soon as your dog lies down, immediately give the treat and verbal praise (“Good!”) 7. Walk a couple of steps away to a new location. 8. Repeat Steps 3 through 7. Practice this a few times. 9. Did you notice you haven’t told your dog to “Rest” yet? Just as you learned with the Sit command, do not give the verbal command until you can get him to lie down consistently by moving your treat-filled hand down to the ground. Once you’re sure he’s going to do this properly the next time you do that, say “Rest” in a calm, low voice a split second before you start moving your hand. When he lies down, immediately reward your dog with the treat and “Good!” praise.

57

10. Repeat this process five times, saying “Rest” in a calm, low voice just before he does so and rewarding his correct response. If your dog doesn’t do what you want If your dog backs up instead of lying down, try having him sit with his back to a corner, so he can’t back up. If your dog doesn’t lie down all the way, repeat steps 3 through 7 but add this: place your other hand (the one without the treat) on his back, just behind his shoulders, and gently push him slightly sideways and downward as you move the hand with the treat down to the ground. If your dog still doesn’t want to lie down, try moving him to a rug. (Some dogs simply don’t like lying on cold, hard surfaces.) As with other lessons, make sure your dog is not too distracted...or nervous. He’ll be more willing to lie down if he’s calm and relaxed. If he’s nervous or full of energy, postpone your lesson until he’s settled down. Remember to keep your tone of voice calm and low. Remember, the instant he lies down, give the treat and praise (“Good!”). This Week’s Homework Practice this lesson several times a day. Vary the time of day and location. Also watch your dog when you’re not practicing the lessons, and when he starts to lie down on his own, say “Rest” as he does so. Then quickly give him a treat and praise. In Addition to Practicing This Lesson…


Reinforce Lesson 4, Teaching Your Dog to Stay. Vary the time of day and location. Make sure there are few distractions. Remember to use the same commands (“Stay,” “Free”) every time, using a low, quiet tone of voice. Practice using your “stop” hand signal, making sure it’s different from your “Sit” hand motion. Hold the treat in the hand you are NOT using for the “stop” signal. Give instant praise and reward after just a couple of seconds by bringing the treat all the way to his mouth so he doesn’t move to get it. If that’s consistently going well, try extending the amount of time for your dog to stay by a few seconds longer before being released.

58

Important: Don’t be tempted to extend the stay any longer than a few seconds before you’ve built a very strong foundation with this command.


Reinforce Lesson 3, Teaching Your Dog to Come when Called. Continue teaching your dog to come when called at various times throughout the week. Practice in various locations, at different times of the day. Remember the priority is to teach him that coming to you is a wonderful thing that will make him very happy. Don’t use the come command when what you’ll do when he comes is something he won’t like. If he’s responding well when you’re 10 feet away, try moving about 20 feet away from your dog before asking him to come. Resist the temptation to give the come command (“Come! Come! Come!”) more than once if your dog doesn’t immediately respond. Instead, go to your dog and show him the treat in your hand. Give the verbal command in an enthusiastic voice, turn and move away while clapping. Be sure to praise (“Good!”) as soon as he looks at you, and then reinforce generously with treats when he reaches you. Note: Remaining calm and patient when being ignored is difficult for most people, but please don’t get frustrated if your dog doesn’t come every time you call him. Some dogs learn more slowly than others. Also, like children, dogs tend to become more willful as they get older, and may occasionally decide that whatever they are doing is more interesting at the moment than coming to you. Sometimes even walking over to him and showing the treat won’t work. Don’t get angry, don’t raise your voice, don’t repeat the come command over and over. Instead, gently take him by the collar or snap on the leash and lead him away from whatever he’s interested in and to the destination you want—then give him a praise and a wonderful reward. The worst thing you can do is lose your temper and yell angrily at your dog. If your dog ignores your come command but eventually does stop whatever he’s doing and comes to you on his own, you can say to him whatever you want to vent your frustration—as long as you say it in a loving, happy, singsong voice. “You stubborn little bastard. If you ignore me like that again I’ll sell your ass on eBay.”  Remember, you’re saying this is a loving, happy voice. Pet your dog as you’re saying it. Make him happy he came to you. This little mental trick will help you feel better while still reinforcing your dog’s correct (though belated) behavior.



Reinforce Lesson 2, Teaching Your Dog to Sit. By this time your dog should be responding to both the verbal and arm motion sit commands even when the level of distraction is fairly high. If your dog does so consistently, you can back off on the formal practicing of this lesson. But do continue the verbal praise

59

(“Good!”) when your dog sits on command. Also use petting (make sure it’s the kind he likes) and play as rewards instead of treats. (An occasional treat is still a good idea.)

Lesson 6: Teaching Your Dog Not to Jump Up on People

Photo Credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/yomanimus/

The importance of this lesson may depend on the size of your dog. A dog the size of a Chihuahua jumping up on you (or visitors as they come through your door) won’t create quite the same problem as a 100-pound bear of a dog. But then again, muddy paws are messy, regardless of their size. And some visitors may not enjoy being “greeted” by any jumping dog. Teaching your dog not to jump up on people will take extra time and patience because dogs naturally greet friends and family by sniffing or licking each other’s muzzles. Your “muzzle” is too high, so they try to jump up to reach it. They’re not being rude or pushy; they’re being sociable! We just need to train them to be sociable in human terms. You’ll need a volunteer to help you with this lesson. Lesson 6: Teaching Your Dog Not to Jump Up on People

60

Read this lesson first, and then practice it with your dog. For Teaching Your Dog Not to Jump on Visitors: 1. Load up your pocket (or a bag or pouch) with treats. 2. Take your dog near the door where you and your visitors most often come into the house. (You and your dog will be inside the house.) 3. Ask your helper to come through the door and, as soon as your dog gets within a few feet, have your helper ask your dog to sit in a low, calm voice. 4. If your dog sits, immediately praise him and give him a treat. (Your helper makes the request, but you provide the reward for correct behavior.) 5. Repeat this exercise five times. If your dog doesn’t do what you want If your dog doesn’t sit when asked to do so by your helper, move in front of your dog (so you’re facing him) and ask him to sit yourself. Immediately reward his correct behavior with praise and a treat. Practice this a couple of times: after your helper comes through the door, you step in front of your dog as he approaches the helper, face your dog and ask him to sit, then give the reward. After he sits successfully for you two or three times, ask your helper to ask your dog to sit after coming through the door. If your dog still won’t sit and keeps trying to jump up on your helper, don’t raise your voice or show impatience; your dog is probably just a bit too excited about greeting your helper. Instead, when your dog doesn’t sit as asked by your helper, instruct your helper to abruptly turn his back on your dog, walk outside and close the door. If your dog then turns to you, do the same—turn your back on your dog. After about 10 seconds, have your helper come back in, approach your dog again and ask him to sit… and again turn his back, walk out and close the door if your dog does not comply. Have your helper keep doing this until your dog sits as requested—then immediately reward your dog with praise and several treats for (finally!) calming down and doing as asked! Note: If you can get more than one person to volunteer to help you with this lesson, individually at various times, your dog will more quickly learn the correct response (sitting, not jumping) for anyone who comes into the house. For Teaching Your Dog Not to Jump on You: 1. Think of situations in which your dog is likely to jump on you, and be prepared to ask him to sit before he can do so… ideally, when he gets within six feet of you.

61

2. Practice training sessions where you go out and come back into the house, through various doors. Use the same methods as mentioned above: ask your dog to sit after you come in, and immediately reward the correct response. 3. Plan your practice sessions for when your dog is relatively calm. 4. Use your verbal sit command as well as your hand motion, as learned in Lesson 2. Important: Keep your voice low and calm. This may require diligence and practice on your part, especially if you’re coming home after being gone all day and are used to greeting your dog with excitement and enthusiasm. Remember: the goal is to control your dog’s excitement so that he’s less likely to jump up on you. So try not to sound excited to see him. If you’re calm, he’ll calm down quicker. 5. Give praise and treats when your dog sits as requested. Tip: Have a baggy of treats ready outside your door, so you can quickly reward your dog for sitting whenever you come into the house. 6. Don’t have your dog sit for long. Ask him to sit, give him the rewards as soon as he does so, and then move away and allow him to follow. Give him a chew toy or do something that takes his focus away from jumping up to greet you. If your dog doesn’t do what you want If your dog doesn’t sit when asked, turn your back on your dog, walk outside and close the door. After about 10 seconds, come back in, approach your dog again and ask him to sit… and again turn your back, walk out and close the door if your dog does not comply. Keep doing this until your dog sits as requested—then immediately reward your dog with praise and several treats for doing as asked. If you’re practicing in other areas and other situations where you dog might jump on you, immediately turn your back on him if he doesn’t sit when asked. Don’t talk to him. The point is to teach your dog that he’ll lose your attention when he jumps up on you or doesn’t sit when asked. Important: When your dog jumps up on you, do not attempt to correct this behavior by pushing him away with your hands, or by bringing up your knee to block his jump or force him backwards. This is what many trainers tell people to do, but don’t do it. Most dogs will perceive this action as play, and they’ll get even more excited and will jump back with greater enthusiasm. This is the not the effect you want. Instead, follow the above instructions for deterring their jumping behavior (turn your back, walk away). Being ignored by you is “punishment” enough for most dogs, and they’ll quickly learn to sit as asked, rather than jump up.

62

Bonus Lesson: Getting Your Dog to Go to His Room when Visitors Come Sometimes it’s easier to avoid a jumping-up situation than try to prevent or correct it. To do this, teach your dog to run to another room when the doorbell rings or someone knocks. For this lesson you’ll need a hallow toy stuffed with peanut butter, cheese or some other food your dog really likes. 1. Pick a designated room where you want your dog to go when the doorbell rings or someone knocks. 2. Have the hallow, food-stuffed toy ready on a shelf or somewhere (other than the floor) in that room so you can quickly grab it. 3. When your dog is in the house and calm, go to the door and ring the bell and/or knock, then run to the designated room, calling your dog and clapping so he’ll run after you. 4. As soon as your dog follows you into the room, give him the food-stuffed toy, leave the room and shut the door (with him still in the room, of course). 5. After 10-20 seconds, go into the room, take the toy away and let your dog out. 6. Wait about 10 minutes, and then repeat Steps 3 through 5. 7. Practice this exercise three times, pausing for several minutes between each session. This will teach your dog that if he runs to the designated room when the doorbell rings or someone knocks, he’ll get a delicious reward. 8. For your fourth practice session, change the procedure a bit. While your dog is still inside the closed room busy with the food-stuffed toy, go ring the doorbell or knock and then talk as if you’re greeting friends. After a few seconds, go let your dog out of the room. 9. After your dog has learned to run to the designated room when the doorbell rings or someone knocks, advance the training with a real visitor. After the visitor has been inside for a few minutes, go let your dog out of the room. As your dog approaches the visitor, practice the “no jumping” lesson where your visitor asks your dog to sit as he approaches. Immediately reward his correct response.

63

Tip: Give your dog the food-stuffed toy whenever visitors are in the house, so he’ll be more interested in that than jumping up on them. This Week’s Homework Practice these lessons several times a day. Vary the time of day and location. In Addition to Practicing This Lesson…

Reinforce Lesson 5, Teaching Your Dog to Lie Down. Vary the time of day and location. Make sure there are few distractions. After getting your dog to sit, move your treat-filled hand directly downward from his nose. Say “Rest” in a calm, low voice a split second before you start moving your hand. Be prepared to hold the treat on the ground for a few seconds, or tap the ground to get his attention. If necessary, press gently on his back. When he lies down, immediately reward your dog with the treat and “Good!” praise. Also practice saying “Rest” just before your dog lies down on his own. Reward him as usual.



Reinforce Lesson 4, Teaching Your Dog to Stay. Vary the time of day and location. Make sure there are few distractions. Remember to use the same commands (“Stay,” “Free”) every time, using a low, quiet tone of voice. Give instant praise and reward for staying as asked by bringing the treat all the way to his mouth so he doesn’t move to get it. If that’s consistently going well, try extending the amount of time for your dog to stay by a few seconds longer than last week before being released. Later this week, when you think your dog is ready, work on the “distance” element of this lesson by backing up just one or two steps after asking your dog to stay. As you back up, slowly drop your “stop sign” hand signal, so both your arms are loosely by your side. Stop moving after a couple of short steps and stand very still, looking directly at your dog. After a couple of seconds, move forward and give your dog the treat. As your dog is eating it, rock back a bit, wait a second, and give the release command (“Free”). Remember to keep your voice low and calm when giving the release command and don’t praise him for getting up.

64

If your dog starts to get up before you give the release command, immediately move forward to block his forward motion, raising your hand in the stop signal again. Important: Drop your arm and back off as soon as he stops moving forward. If you wait too long and your dog is already up and moving before you can “block” him, just go up to him and use a treat to again lure him back to where he started… and try again. Remember to remain calm, and avoid repeating the verbal command to stay.


Reinforce Lesson 3, Teaching Your Dog to Come when Called. Continue teaching your dog to come when called at various times throughout the week. Practice in various locations, at different times of the day. Remember the priority is to teach him that coming to you is a wonderful thing that will make him very happy. Don’t use the come command when what you’ll do when he comes is something he won’t like. If he’s responding well when you’re 20 feet away, try moving about 30 feet away from your dog before asking him to come. Resist the temptation to give the come command (“Come! Come! Come!”) more than once if your dog doesn’t immediately respond. Instead, go to your dog and show him the treat in your hand. Give the verbal command in an enthusiastic voice, turn and move away while clapping. Be sure to praise (“Good!”) as soon as he looks at you, and then reinforce generously with treats when he reaches you.

Lesson 7: Teaching Your Dog to Heel

Photo Credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/ktylerconk/

If you’ve ever been taken for a walk by a strong, willful dog, you can’t help but gaze in wistful admiration at people whose dogs walks calmly by their sides, even when off a leash. But there’s more to gain from teaching your dog to heel than no longer being dragged down the street. When walking your dog is not a “chore,” you’ll enjoy it more, you’ll do it more, and you and your dog will both benefit from more frequent walks. Teaching an energetic and always-curious dog to walk slowly by your side and ignore all the fascinating scents and other distractions during your outings will be a major challenge. After all, dogs, unlike people, do not naturally walk side-by-side with their friends and family.

66

Some dog trainers (amateurs and professionals alike) use various forms of choke collars, brute force, and intimidation to teach dogs to heel. From a dog’s point of view, this concept of “heel” must seem more like “hell.” As you know by now, that’s not how we operate. Teaching your dog to heel will be easier than you think when you make the lessons an interesting game. But it will take a little time; you may not get to a finished “heel” for a few weeks. That’s OK, because the process will be lots of fun for you and your dog. Follow our training system, and soon you and your dog will be the ones struggling dog walkers gaze at in wistful admiration! Lesson 7: Teaching Your Dog to Heel Read this lesson first, and then practice it with your dog. 1. Load up your pocket (or a bag or pouch) with treats. 2. Take your dog to a quiet area where it’s safe for her to be off a leash. 3. Decide on which side you’ll prefer your dog to heel—your left side or your right. It doesn’t matter which side you choose, but once you decide, don’t change your mind later and confuse your dog. For the purposes of this lesson, we’ll use the left side. If you prefer the right side, just substitute “right” whenever we say “left.” 4. Put a few treats in your left hand. 5. Show your dog the treats in your hand and then start walking away. 6. Encourage your dog to stay with you as you walk away. Call her name, slap your left leg, make smoochy noises, etc. Pick up the pace of your walking, almost as if you’re trying to get away. As you’re doing all this, wave the hand with the treats down low on your left side so your dog knows where they are. 7. If your dog follows you, stop after a few strides and give her the treats and lots of praise. It’s great if she’s stayed right by your side, but don’t worry if she lags a bit behind at this point. 8. Wait a couple of minutes, and then repeat Steps 4 through 7. Vary your walking speed and make sudden changes in direction. The point is to make it interesting and fun for your dog to keep up with you. If your dog doesn’t do what you want If your dog doesn’t follow you, go back to her and put the treats right under her nose before walking away and encouraging her to follow.

67

If she still isn’t interested, the treats are not tempting enough or she’s too distracted. Find a treat she likes better, wait until she’s hungrier, or move to a less-distracting location.

This Week’s Homework Practice this lesson a couple of times a day, but only for short periods of a minute or less. Make sure there are few distractions, and your dog is eager to play and get lots of yummy treats. In Addition to Practicing This Lesson…


Reinforce Lesson 6, Teaching Your Dog Not to Jump Up on People. Vary the time of day and location. Make sure there are few distractions. You’ll need a helper to come in the door and ask your dog to “Sit,” while you’re ready with a treat and reward if she does so. After a couple of successes, see if she’ll sit automatically when your helper comes in, without giving the “Sit” command. If she does, give her lots of praise (but in a low, calm voice) and extra treats. If she doesn’t, go back to practicing with the verbal command a couple of times, then try again without it. Don’t get frustrated if your dog has a hard time controlling her excitement and learning not to jump up on people. Some dogs learn this lesson quickly; others take a long time and a lot of practice. Make sure you and your helper remain calm with body movements and tone of voice (even when giving praise). Remember, with this lesson it’s very important to quell your dog’s excitement, not encourage it. Try to get visitors to ask your dog to sit every time they approach your dog. Be sure to have treats ready (and be sure your dog knows you have them). Don’t bother trying this when your dog is overly excited. Also practice coming in the door yourself. Have a treat ready, ask her to sit as soon as she approaches you, and give the rewards when she does so. Repeat this three or four times. Practice giving the verbal praise (“Good”) in a quiet tone of voice, with long, slow sounds rather than short, high-pitched tones.

Try to do two or three sessions a day, if possible.

Reinforce Lesson 5, Teaching Your Dog to Lie Down. Vary the time of day and location. Make sure there are few distractions. This week you want to work on getting your dog to lie down without pressing on her back or tapping on the ground as encouragement. Sit or squat down next to your dog. Ask her to lie down (“Rest”), followed by moving your hand (filled with a treat) down toward the ground. Do not tap the ground; do not press on her back. If she lies down, immediately reward your dog with the treat and “Good!” praise. If she doesn’t lie down, try again, and make sure she knows about the treat in your hand. Use it as a lure under her nose, going down toward the ground. After a couple of successes, ask her again to lie down but move your hand only partway to the ground, stopping a few inches above it. Praise and reward her correct response. Continue this for a few sessions, each time stopping your treatfilled hand a bit higher from the ground after giving the verbal command. (Don’t give her the treat until she lies all the way down.) During sessions later in the week, ask her to lie down (“Rest”) while you are standing up. Make sure she knows the treat is in your hand, and lure her down with it, bending your knees and moving your hand as close to the ground as necessary for her to understand you want her to lie down. Important: Do not bend over at the waist toward your dog. This is too much body movement and your dog may think that’s part of the nonverbal command. Practice asking your dog to lie down (“Rest”) from a standing position, sweeping your hand in a downward motion toward the ground as you bend your knees. During your sessions, gradually bend your knees less and stop your hand motion higher from the ground. Eventually, you’ll want her to respond to the verbal command while you’re standing up straight and just making the arm motion without moving the treat down to the ground. Also this week, continue saying “Rest” just before your dog lies down on her own. Reward her as usual.



Reinforce Lesson 4, Teaching Your Dog to Stay. Vary the time of day and location. Remember to use the same commands (“Stay,” “Free”) every time, using a low, quiet tone of voice. Gradually increase the duration, distance and level of distraction as your dog responds well in her practice sessions, but work on only one of the “3 D’s” at a

69

time. Remember to emphasize the “Stay” with rewards, not the release (“Free”). Lie Down/Stay If your dog is responding well so far, ask your dog to stay while lying down. This is useful when you want your dog to stay put for more than a minute. In a quiet room, when you are about two feet away from your dog, ask your dog to sit, then lie down (“Rest”). You want her lying down comfortably, with her hips flipped over to one side, rather than on her belly with her legs tucked underneath, ready to jump back up. If she doesn’t do so on her own, encourage her to lie with her hips flipped on their side by putting a treat in front of her nose and luring her head back toward her shoulder. This will help cause her to flop over onto her side. Give her the treat and quiet verbal praise; you don’t want her to get excited and get up. Have another treat ready. Try to be sure and stay two feet from her, so you’re not looming over her. Tell her to “Stay” (make sure your tone of voice makes it a command, not a question), and hold your hand in the “stop sign” signal. After a few seconds, rock forward and with an underhanded motion, pop the treat into her mouth. Be ready to “block” her with your body, as you learned last week, if she starts to get up. After a couple of seconds, calmly give the release command (“Free”) and walk away. Remember, no praise or rewards after the release. After a few minutes, repeat the lie down/stay exercise. Try for two or three short sessions a day.


Reinforce Lesson 3, Teaching Your Dog to Come when Called. Continue teaching your dog to come when called at various times throughout the week. Practice in various locations (inside and out), at different times of the day. Remember the priority is to teach her that coming to you is a wonderful thing that will make her very happy. Don’t use the come command when what you’ll do when she comes is something she won’t like. If she’s responding well when you’re 30 feet away, try moving about 40 feet away from your dog before asking her to come. Be careful about what’s in the space between you and your dog. You don’t want distractions.

70

Don’t forget that coming when called is a difficult lesson for your dog to learn. Unlike sitting or lying down, it’s not based on something she naturally does on her own. Only advance the lessons (increase the distance) as she’s ready, remembering that all dogs learn at different paces. If she’s not ready for greater distance yet, don’t push it. Move closer and try again. Remember the excitement factor.

Resist the temptation to give the come command (“Come! Come! Come!”) more than once if your dog doesn’t immediately respond. Instead, go to your dog and show her the treat in your hand. Give the verbal command in an enthusiastic voice, turn and move away while clapping. Be sure to praise (“Good!”) as soon as she looks at you, and then reinforce generously with treats when she reaches you. Even if she’s responding well, don’t start skimping on the treats just yet. Continue giving generous rewards.


Have fun playing with your dog! Don’t focus all your time together on training. Spend lots of quality time just enjoying each other’s company.

IN CONCLUSION

Dog Training Isn’t About Your Dog
Despite what other dog training books, videos, and experts may say, dog training isn’t about the dog. It’s about you.

The Secret to Dog Training Success
Here’s the secret most dog trainers won’t tell you (some of them don’t even know it themselves): successful dog training is not about getting your dog to understand you— it’s about you understanding your dog. Fortunately, you’re one smart puppy yourself. Humans are smarter than dogs. Yep… no offense to dogs, but even the dumbest blonde you know is smarter than the smartest dog you know. That’s good news, because if you want your dog to be a good student—to learn to sit, stay, heel, come, fetch; in short, to obey your every command—you have to be a good teacher. To be a good teacher, you have to understand how your student thinks. Because you’re smart, this will be a breeze. All you have to do is follow the step-by-step instructions provided in this popular dog training course. Within a few weeks, your dog will be so well trained you’ll be showing him off to all your drooling, envious friends. But it will require some effort on your part.

For Dog Lovers Only
Your dog loves to be with you. He loves to please you. That’s why he’ll be easy to train once you understand him. But if the feeling is not mutual… if the idea of spending time with your dog, training him, playing with him, loving him… does not appeal to you, this is not the course for you. If a dog is nothing more to you than a security system, fashion statement, or status symbol, you won’t like this training course.

72

We guarantee that the “effort” will be fun; the result will be a well-trained, happy dog. And that’s not all. Our ultimate goal is to help you connect with your best friend in a way that will enrich your relationship for years to come. Learning is a life-long adventure. While you’ll have the basic training techniques mastered within a few short weeks, you and your dog will never really be “fully trained.” That’s actually a good thing—because you’ll both enjoy the process so much, neither of you will ever want to stop learning!

PREFACE Nutrition of dogs and cats is central for health and wellbeing. Scientific knowledge about nutrient requirements, digestion of feed and metabolism of nutrients are the guidelines for formulating appropriate diets for dogs and cats. It is therefore important that the composition and nutrient profiles of pet food corresponds to the specific nutritional requirements of dogs and cats in the different life cycles. The European pet food industry has taken up the task of adapting the recommendations for nutrient levels in pet food in close cooperation with independent scientists. A significant step was initiated in the year 2010, when a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) with scientists from European countries was installed. The SAB will ensure to maintain the scientific standards of the recommended nutrient levels and it will advise FEDIAF so that latest research results are transferred into the guidelines and the current feeding practice. Proper nutrition ensuring adequate intakes of energy, protein, minerals and vitamins is essential for dogs and cats to ensure health and longevity. By now these revised nutrient recommendations take the current state of knowledge into account. The recommended values are based on scientific principles and take into account the requirements for practical feeding. This enables the pet food industry to adjust the quality of complete diets for dogs and cats according to the scientific state of the art. Through ongoing communication, research and critical evaluation of new findings FEDIAF and the SAB work on the adaptation of these recommendations in a continuous process. The SAB has set itself the task to accompany this development and to assist FEDIAF in its commitment to safe and healthy pet food. Prof. Jürgen Zentek, Chairman of the SAB ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FEDIAF thanks everyone who has contributed to the quality of these Nutritional Guidelines, especially the Scientific Advisory Board members for reviewing the Guidelines and for the continuing scientific support to the group.

The glossary contains definitions of key words used in this Guideline followed by the source of the definition. Whenever appropriate, definitions are adapted to pet food. I. GLOSSARY DEFINITIONS An Allowance or Recommendation for daily intake (RDI) is the level of intake of a nutrient or food component that appears to be adequate to meet the known nutritional needs of practically all healthy individuals. It reflects the minimum requirement plus a safety margin for differences in availability between individual animals and for nutrient interactions. In practice this would be translated as the levels of essential nutrients that healthy individuals should consume over a,b time to ensure adequate and safe nutrition.

II. INTRODUCTION FEDIAF represents the national pet food industry associations in the EU and from BosniaHerzegovina, Croatia, Norway, Russia, Serbia and Switzerland, representing in the region of 450 pet food factories across Europe. One of FEDIAF’s main objectives is to ascertain the well-being of pets by providing well balanced and nutritionally sound pet food through its member companies. Therefore FEDIAF has compiled the present “Nutritional Guidelines for Complete and Complementary Pet Food for Cats and Dogs”, which is based on the state of the art knowledge on cat and dog nutrition, providing pet food manufacturers with nutritional recommendations to ensure the production of well balanced and nutritionally sound pet food. This document is reviewed yearly and updated whenever there are new relevant technological, scientific or legislative developments in pet nutrition. 1. OBJECTIVES The objectives of FEDIAF’s Guidelines for Complete and Complementary Pet Foods for Cats and Dogs are: i) To contribute to the production of nutritionally balanced pet food, while complying with relevant EU legislation on animal nutrition. To achieve this objective, the guidelines incorporate up-to-date scientific knowledge on cat and dog nutrition to:  Provide practical nutrient recommendations for pet food manufacturers when formulating their products for adult maintenance, growth and reproduction;  Help pet food manufacturers to assess the nutritional value of practical pet foods for healthy animals; ii) To be the reference document on pet nutrition in Europe for EU and local authorities, consumer organisations, professionals, and customers. iii) To enhance cooperation between pet food manufacturers, pet care professionals and competent authorities by providing scientifically sound information on the formulation and assessment of pet foods. iv) To complement FEDIAF’s Guide to Good Practice for the Manufacture of Safe Pet Foods and the FEDIAF’s Guide to Good Practice for Communication on Pet Food.

2. SCOPE FEDIAF’s Nutritional Guidelines provide: i) Recommendations for minimum and maximum nutrient levels in commercial pet foods for healthy dogs and cats, to ensure adequate and safe nutrition; ii) iii) iv)  Guidance for the assessment of the nutritional value of pet foods; Recommendations for energy intake; Annexes with advice on specific topics. The levels in this guide reflect the amounts of essential nutrients in commercial products that are required to ensure adequate and safe nutrition in healthy individuals when consumed over time.  The recommended minimum levels include a safety margin to prevent deficiencies due to animal variations and nutrient interactions.  These guidelines relate to dog and cat foods manufactured from ingredients with normal digestibility (i.e.  70% DM digestibility;  80% protein digestibility) and average bioavailability.  The maximum recommended nutrient levels are based on EU legal limits (L) or levels that are considered nutritionally safe (N) based on research data.  Pet foods can be adequate and safe when nutrient levels are outside the recommendations in this guide, based on the manufacturer’s substantiation of nutritional adequacy and safety. Excluded from the FEDIAF’s nutritional Guidelines are pet foods for particular nutritional purposes and some other specialised foods such as for sporting dogs etc. Therefore specific products may have nutrient levels that are different from those stated in these guidelines.

III. COMPLETE PET FOOD

1 Guidance Complete pet food means pet food which, by reason of its composition, is sufficient for a daily ration (Regulation EU No. 767/2009 adapted). When a complete pet food is fed for an extended period (i.e. covering the whole period of the life stage) as the only source of nutrients, it will provide all the nutritional needs of the particular animals of the given species and physiological state for which it is intended. If a manufacturer labels a product as a complete pet food without specification of a determined life stage, it is assumed to be complete for all life stages, and should be formulated according to the levels recommended for early growth and reproduction. If the product is designed for a specific life stage, then the label must clearly state this. For example "Bloggo" is a complete pet food for breeding cats, or "Bloggo" is a complete pet food for growing puppies. FEDIAF recommends to all members of each National Association that before a complete pet food is placed on the market: i) It should be formulated to take account of current nutritional knowledge and using the data compiled in this guide. ii) If certain nutrient levels are outside the values stated in this guide, manufacturers should be able to prove that the product provides adequate and safe intakes of all required nutrients. iii) Each family of products (Annex VII) should be validated by chemical analysis of the finished product. It is recommended to use an officially recognised method (Chapter V). 1.1 Minimum recommended nutrient levels in cat and dog foods The nutrient requirements of cats and dogs are the subject of ongoing research. When formulating pet foods, manufacturers should not use a reference to minimum requirements but minimum recommended levels ensuring adequate nutrient intake as contained in this guide. The nutritional tables are provided in “units/100 g DM” (Tables A1 & B1), “units/1000 kcal ME” (Tables A2 & B2) and “units/MJ ME” (Tables A3 & B3). This FEDIAF Guide is based on published scientific studies (including NRC 2006) and unpublished data from the industry. 1.2 Energy contents of pet foods Feeding trials are the most accurate way to measure the energy density of a cat and dog food (see Chapter VI for the different methods). A feeding trial normally measures digestible energy. By subtracting the energy lost in the urine, the same trials allow also for determining the metabolizable energy. The energy lost in the urine
9/75

Publication – July 2012

can be measured if urine is collected or, if urine is not collected, be calculated using the following correction factors: 1.25 kcal (5.23 kJ) g-1 digestible crude protein for dogs and 0.86 kcal (3.60 kJ) g-1 digestible protein for cats (Chapter VI). Alternatively, formulae given in annex I can be used by manufacturers to calculate the energy content of practical diets. In addition, a bibliographic survey for calculating the energy needs of dogs and cats, in relation to body weight, physiological state and specific activities, is reported in annex I. 1.3 Maximum levels of certain substances in pet food for cats and dogs For certain nutrients, FEDIAF has defined a nutritional maximum level in these guidelines. This is the maximum level of a nutrient in a complete pet food that, based on scientific data, has not been associated with adverse effects in healthy dogs and cats. Levels exceeding the nutritional maximum may still be safe, however, no scientific data are currently known to FEDIAF. Until further scientific data are available FEDIAF recommends that commercial pet foods should not exceed this nutritional maximum. In addition, maximum permitted levels have been determined by the legislator for several nutrients if added as a nutritional additive (i.e. trace-elements & vitamin D) (legal maximum). They are laid down in the Community Register of Feed Additives pursuant to Regulation 1831/2002/EC of the Parliament and the Council, concerning additives in feeding stuffs. The legal maximum levels apply to all life stages (EU Regulation 1831/2003 in conjunction with EU register of feed additives). A legal maximum only applies when the particular trace-element or vitamin is added to the recipe as an additive, but relates to the ‘total’ amount present in the finished product [amount coming from the additive + amount from feed materials (ingredients)]. If the nutrient comes exclusively from feed materials, the legal maximum does not apply, instead the nutritional maximum, when included in the relevant tables, should be taken into account. Both groups of maximum values are reported in the FEDIAF tables A1-3 and B1-3 of chapter III. A non-exhaustive list of scientifically recognised analytical methods that can be used to assess the nutrient levels in pet food is available in Chapter V. 1.4 Product validation Before a product is placed on the market, it should have undergone the necessary procedures to ensure its adequacy.

The following nutrients should be taken into consideration for evaluation of nutritional adequacy. NUTRIENTS
Major nutrients Fatty acids Protein Fat Linoleic acid Alpha-linolenic acid Arginine Cysteine Phenylalanine Leucine Calcium Sodium Chloride Manganese Vitamin A Thiamine Niacin Cobalamin Taurine (cats) Arachidonic acid (cats) Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) Histidine Tyrosine Threonine Methionine Phosphorus Copper Magnesium Zinc Vitamin D Riboflavin Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) Folic acid Choline Isoleucine Lysine Tryptophan Valine Potassium Iron Iodine Selenium Vitamin E Pantothenic acid Biotin Vitamin K

Amino acids

Minerals

Vitamins

Vitamin-like substances Remarks

See section on analytical method pp. for the appropriate method and other details. Routine analysis for energy calculation includes moisture, crude protein, crude fat, crude ash, crude fibre (Weende analysis)

1.5 Repeat analyses Once a product has been passed and the formula remains essentially unchanged, there is no need for further analysis. However, bearing in mind the fluctuations in raw materials, it is recommended that regular analyses are conducted to make sure that the product still meets the appropriate nutritional standards and / or truly satisfies its claim of belonging to a family. The frequency of testing is the responsibility of the manufacturer. If the manufacturer makes a major change in the formulation or processing, complete reanalysis is recommended. 1.6 Directions for use / feeding instructions The manufacturer is required to provide, as part of the statutory statement, directions for the proper use of a pet food indicating the purpose for which it is intended. The feeding instructions should be clear and complete, and give an indication of the daily amounts to be fed. Feeding instructions could also provide information about the frequency of feeding, the need to have water available, and possible need to adapt the amount according to activity. ANNEX I can be used as basis to calculate the amounts to feed.

2 Tables with Nutrient Recommendations

- How to read the tables Values are expressed as follows: recommended minimum value The maximum nutrient levels are listed in a separate column on the right and are indicated by (N) for nutritional maximum and (L) for legal maximum. For commercial dog and cat foods it is recommended that the nutrient levels are at or above the levels listed in the tables and do not exceed the nutritional or legal maximum. If the protein digestibility of ≥ 80% (mentioned in the scope, paragraph 2 of Chapter II) cannot be guaranteed, it is recommended to increase the essential amino acid levels by a minimum of 10%. An asterisk (*) indicates that there is further information in the substantiation section which follows the nutrient recommendations The nutritional tables provide nutrient allowances in “units/100 g dry matter (DM)”, “units/1000 kcal ME” and “units/MJ ME”. Conversion factors: Units/100g DM Units/100g DM Units/1000kcal Units/1000kcal Units/MJ Units/MJ x 2.5 x 0.598 x 0.4 x 0.239 = units/1000kcal = units/MJ = units/100g DM = units/MJ

x 1.6736 = units/100g DM x 4.184 = units/1000kcal

These conversions assume an energy density of 16.7kJ (4.0kcal) ME/g DM. For foods with energy densities different from this value, the recommendations should be corrected for energy density.

Specific recommendations for nutrient intake during reproduction are only available for a few nutrients. Hence, until more data become available, recommendations in the tables combine early growth and reproduction for dogs, and growth and reproduction for cats. Where there are proven differences between the two life stages both values are stated. They are declared as follows: value for growth / value for reproduction.

 

The nutrient levels in the tables are minimum recommended allowances for commercial pet food, not minimum requirements or optimal intake levels The right column indicates the maximum recommended value The legal maximum (L) is mandatory and always applies to all life stages. The nutritional maximum (N) is the highest level that is not supposed to cause any harmful effect. Unless the life stage is indicated it applies to all life stages.

When a nutrient has an asterisk (*), additional information and substantiation references are available in Chapter III. 3. Tables A4 and B4.

3 Substantiation of nutrient recommendations’ tables
The following section provides substantiation and explanation for the recommended allowances (RA) (nutrient recommendations) for dogs and cats in the previous tables. These recommendations are based on scientific publications, NRC 2006 and data from the pet food industry. TABLE A4 – Substantiation of nutrient recommendations for dogs GENERAL 1
Amino acids, trace elements, vitamins (Adult dogs) Unless indicated with an * and substantiated hereafter, the values recommended for adult dogs are the levels recommended by NRC 2006 increased by 20% to compensate for the lower energy requirement of household dogs (see Annex I) compared to the energy intake assumed by NRC.

NRC Chapter 15. Nutrient Requirements and Dietary Nutrient Concentrations. In: Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats. The National Academic Press, Washington, DC. 2006: pp. 359-360, table 15-4.

PROTEIN Total protein 1
Total protein (Adult dogs) The RA by NRC-2006 of 25g/1000kcal (6g/MJ) a for adult dogs is based on Sanderson et al. . However, the diet in this study had a high protein digestibility and the energy intake was 0.75 around 130kcal (550 kJ) /kgBW . FEDIAF has adjusted the protein level to take into account a digestibility of 75% and added a 20% to account for lower energy intakes for pet dogs, giving a RA of 40g/1000kcal (9.56g/MJ). This value has been increased to 45g/1000kcal (10.8g/MJ) to cover requirements of older dogs b,c,d . This is equivalent to 18g per 100g DM (10.8 g/MJ). If formulating below 18g protein/100g it is particularly important to ensure that the amino acid profile meets FEDIAF guidelines for adult maintenance. The recommendation for protein assumes the diet contains some carbohydrate to decrease the risk of hypoglycaemia in the bitch and neonatal mortality. If carbohydrate is absent or at a very low level, the protein requirement is a, b, c much higher, and may be double.

Total protein (Growth)

For practical foods made from cereals and various animal by-products, the crude protein level needed for maximum nitrogen retention appears to be about 25 per cent dry matter for newly weaned puppies, whereas for puppies over 14 weeks of age it is 20 per cent dry a matter.

Lysine
1 Lysine (nutritional maximum puppies) for Czarnecki et al. (1985) showed that excess dietary lysine (4.91% DM [basal diet 0.91% + 4% from a supplement]) decreases weight gain in puppies but not 2.91 % DM (basal diet + 2% from a supplement). It was concluded that the highest no-effect-level of lysine for puppies was 2.91% DM (energy density 4156 kcal/kg) 17.39MJ/kg). This is equivalent to 7.0 g/1000 kcal (1.67g/MJ) or 2.8% DM (at 4 kcal/g DM) and this is therefore the FEDIAF maximum for puppy growth.

Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids
1 Omega-3 and Omega-6 polyunsaturated long chain fatty acids (Growth & Reproduction) During gestation and early life after birth, DHA and arachidonic acid (AA) are selectively f accumulated within the brain and retina. Supplementation with α-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid during gestation and lactation is an ineffective means of increasing the milk content a of DHA and AA respectively. Although very young puppies have the capacity to convert some ALA into DHA, after weaning puppies lose c this capacity. Moreover, electroretinograms have revealed improved vision in puppies from mothers fed n-3 long chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids and fed b,d,e the same food after weaning. Consequently it is preferable to have small amounts of DHA and/or EPA, as well as AA in foods for growth and reproduction to supply enough for neonatal nutritional modifications.

Omega 3 fatty acids (Adult dogs)

Omega 3 vs. 6 FA (Adult dogs)

Although there is increasing evidence of beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids, the current information is insufficient to recommend a specific level of omega-3 fatty acids for adult dogs. The effects of omega-3 fatty acids depend on the level as well as on the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids. Very high levels of long chain omega-3 fatty acids can decrease cellular immunity, particularly in the presence of a low a, b level of omega-6 fatty acids .

recommends that the calcium level in a pet food for early growth should be at least 1g/100g DM. During late growth, it is recommended that large breed and giant breed puppies continue to be fed a pet food containing at least 1 % of calcium until about 6 months of age. During the whole late growth phase, pet foods for puppies of small and medium size breeds may contain less calcium (minimum 0.8% DM) and the calciumphosphorus ratio can be increased to 1.8/1.

High intake of calcium has an adverse effect on skeletal development in large breed dogs, particularly during the early growth phase. a,b Therefore a strict nutritional maximum is recommended for foods intended for large breed puppies. Weber et al. showed that when feeding a balanced food, a calcium level of 1.6 % DM from 9 weeks of age does not cause side effects. c,d During later growth up to 1.8% DM can be fed to all breed dogs including giant breeds with the exception of great Danes.

Iodine
1 Iodine From studies by Castillo et al. a low nutritional maximum for iodine in dogs (0.4mg/100gDM) was recommended. However in these studies puppies were significantly overfed (approx. 75% above energy requirement) which resulted in a substantially increased intake of iodine. Furthermore the food was deficient in a number of key nutrients, e.g. Ca, P and K, and therefore inappropriate for puppies. Consequently, these results are irrelevant for normal commercial nutritionally balanced foods, and the existing legal maximum is safe for all dogs.

VITAMINS
Vitamin A
1 Vitamin A The FEDIAF maximum is based on the studies reported by Hathcock et al., Goldy et al. and a,b,c Cline et al. in adult dogs . The value is 80% of the dose that Goldy et al. identified “as may be approaching a level that challenges the dog's ability to maintain normal vitamin A homeostasis” and about 45% of the no-adverseeffect intake established by Cline et al. over one year (no detrimental effects on bone health). Furthermore Hathcock et al. reported an intake at least three times the FEDIAF nutritional maximum as safe in adult dogs fed for ten months (body growth and haematological indices unaffected). In view of these data the FEDIAF maximum is considered appropriate for all life stages. There is no evidence so far that the nutritional maximum for puppies should be different from the current nutritional maximum for adults. This value has been used in this guide for at least 10 years and has never given rise to any problems c-e in growing dogs. Moreover, in a study supported by the pet food industry no adverse effect has been seen in puppies of different breeds when fed a puppy food containing 40,000 IU of vitamin A per 100g DM (4kcal/g or a,b 16.74 kj/g).

1 Omega 3 fatty acids (Growth & Reproduction) The study by Pawlosky et al. suggests that juvenile felines it is important that the status of DHA in the nervous system is maintained for optimal retinal function. However, young felines a have a low synthetic capacity to produce DHA. Therefore it is recommended to have a small amounts of DHA and/or EPA in foods for growth and reproduction. Although there is increasing evidence of beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids, the current information is insufficient to recommend a specific level of omega-3 fatty acids for adult cats.

TRACE ELEMENTS
General
1 General Manufacturers are reminded that the bioavailability of trace-elements is reduced by a high content of certain minerals (e.g. calcium), the level of other trace elements (e.g. high zinc decreases copper absorption) and sources of phytic acid (e.g. some soy products).

1 Iodine Based on the Tc99m thyroid to salivary ratio, Wedekind et al. (2010) have estimated that the minimum requirement of iodine for the cat is 0.46 mg/kg DM; but closer analysis of the data indicated that iodine requirements may be a closer to 1.1 mg/kg DM. The recommended allowance, therefore, has been set at 1.3 mg/kg DM, taking into account a safety margin of 20%. This corresponds with the minimum requirement stated by NRC (Table 15-12) b.

weeks on a vitamin A intake of 50,000 IU/kg BW corresponding to about 90,000 IU per 100g DM. Therefore, FEDIAF’s maximum of 40,000 IU/100g DM can be considered safe for growing kittens. b Freytag et al. reported that feeding a food with 100,000 IU/100g DM to pregnant queens caused fatal malformations in kittens. The next lowest value of 2000 IU/100g DM caused no adverse effects. From these data NRC 2006 recommended not to exceed 33,330 IU/100g c DM in feeding stuffs intended for reproduction. In view of these data, FEDIAF recommends a maximum vitamin A level of 33,330 IU/100g DM for products designed for reproducing queens.

Vitamin E

The vitamin E requirement depends on the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the presence of other antioxidants. An increased level of vitamin E may be required under conditions of high PUFA intake. For cat food, it is recommended to add 5 to 10 IU Vitamin E above minimum level per gram of fish a oil added per kilogram of diet.

IV. COMPLEMENTARY PET FOOD Complementary pet food is legally defined as pet food which has a high content of certain substances but which, by reason of its composition, is sufficient for a daily ration only if used in combination with other pet foods [Regulation (EC) 767/2009]. Complementary pet food covers a wide range of products including: A. Products which significantly contribute to the energy content of the daily ration but are not complete. 1 Products intended to be mixed with other food components in the household to form a complete feed. 2 Treats and snacks are normally given to strengthen the human animal bond and as rewards during training. Although they are not intended to contribute significantly to the daily ration, they may be given in quantities that impact total energy intake. The feeding instructions should give clear recommendations on how not to overfeed. B. Products, which contribute to the daily nutrition and may or may not add significantly to the energy content of the daily ration.  Products used to complement foods, e.g. snacks supplying higher levels of ω-3 & ω-6 fatty acids. C. Products that are not intended to contribute to the nutritional content of the daily ration, but are given to occupy the animal and can be eaten.  Dog chews

1. Recommended allowances In view of the many different types of complementary pet foods, manufacturers are advised to base their feeding instructions on the intended role of the product in the total ration. The total daily ration should match the recommended allowances and nutritional and legal maximum values listed in the tables for complete pet food. 2. Validation procedure FEDIAF recommends that for the purpose of nutrition validation, complementary pet food should be divided into three parts: For products belonging to category A, the validation procedure should comply with that laid

31/75

Publication – July 2012

down for complete pet food in order to assess the nutritional adequacy of the total daily ration. For products belonging to category B, the validation procedure should cover those nutrients that are relevant for the intended use of the product. For occupational products (designed for chewing) belonging to category C; no specific validation procedure for nutritional adequacy is needed. 3. Repeat analyses When a validation procedure is recommended the same rules should apply for complementary and complete pet food.

V. ANALYTICAL METHODS
In order to obtain representative results, samples have to be collected and treated according to the general principles laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 152/2009 of 27 January 2009 establishing Community methods of sampling and analysis for the official control of feeding stuffs. The analysis of only one sample may not reflect the level declared in the average analysis of the product. To obtain a representative analysis, multiple samples coming from different batches have to be analysed. A composite sample made from multiple samples is also valid. To evaluate the results of a single-sample analysis, maximum tolerances for deviation from the declared values, as foreseen in ANNEX IV of Regulation 767/2009 on the marketing and use of feed should be permitted as well as tolerances for analytical latitudes.

Vitamin D analysis of pet foods containing levels which are approaching the minimum recommendation, say between 500 and 1000 IU/kg DM is difficult and unreliable. The detection limit for HPLC methods is approximately 3000 to 5000 IU/kg. Analysis is not required if supplementation is practised and it is unlikely that un-supplemented products with adequate levels of vitamins A and E will be deficient in vitamin D.

VI – FEEDING TEST PROTOCOLS

Recommended feeding trial protocol for the determination of metabolizable energy of cat and dog food GE DE ME kJ kcal Gross energy Digestible energy Metabolizable energy Kilojoule Kilocalorie 1 Indicator method 1. Introduction This feeding protocol has been designed in order to determine ME of cat & dog foods in a way not harmful for cats and dogs and is adapted from the "AAFCO dog and cat food metabolizable energy protocols - Indicator Method” (AAFCO 2007). CP DP BW Cr2O3 Crude protein Digestible protein Body weight Chromic oxide

2. Protocol 2.1 Animals A minimum of six fully grown animals at least one year of age shall complete the test. The animals shall be in good health and of known weight, sex and breed. Animals shall be individually housed during the trial (collection period). 2.2 Feeding Procedures Feeding procedures shall be standardized. The feeding shall consist of two phases. The first phase shall be the pre-collection period of at least three days for dogs and five days for cats (Nott et al. 1994) with the objective of acclimatising the test animals to the diet and adjusting food intake, as necessary, to maintain body weight. The second phase shall be the total collection period; faeces and possibly urine will be collected during at least four days (96 hours) for dogs and five days (120 hours) for cats. 2.3 Food Food type, flavour, and production codes representing the composite feed shall be recorded. The food source shall remain constant throughout the test period. The indicator shall be uniformly mixed in a quantity of food sufficient to feed all animals for the

36/75

Publication – July 2012

duration of the pre-collection and collection periods. If chromic oxide is used, approximately 0.25% of a high quality chromic oxide (Cr203) free of soluble chromium shall be mixed with the food. 2.4 Food Allowances The amount of food presented to each animal may be based upon existing data on the quantity of food required to maintain body weight, or the estimated daily maintenance energy requirements [110-115 kcal (460-480 kJ) ME per kg BW 0.75 for dogs or 60-70 kcal (250-293 kJ) ME per kg BW for cats] (See ANNEX I - Energy). 2.5 Times of Feeding Animals shall be fed at least once daily and at the same time each day. Water shall be available at all times. Food shall be fed as is, or per normal feeding instructions for the product. The excess food shall be weighed back after feeding. 2.6 Pre-trial Termination If, during the pre-collection phase, the food is continually rejected or results in minimal consumption by a majority of the animals, the trial shall not proceed into the collection phase. 2.7 Collection 2.7.1 Faeces Collection It is imperative that all collection containers be clearly marked using double labels or any alternative adequate coding. The labels shall include the animal number, diet number, and dates of collection. Aliquots of faeces from five separate days shall be collected. Every effort should be made to avoid collecting contaminants such as hair. The aliquots shall be dried and pooled per individual animal. 2.7.2 Urine collection During the collection period, all daily urine shall be collected for each animal and weighed, unless a correction factor is used to estimate metabolizable energy. Every effort should be made to avoid collecting contaminants such as hair. 2.8 Sample Preparation 2.8.1 Food The food shall be blended to ensure a uniform consistency and an adequate quantity used for appropriate assays. Ample quantities of the remaining sample should be frozen and retained

37/75

Publication – July 2012

until assay results have been reviewed and found acceptable. 2.8.2 Faeces Faeces shall be analyzed using composite samples. The samples shall be blended to ensure a uniform consistency and an adequate quantity used for appropriate assays. Ample quantities of the remaining sample should be frozen and retained until assay results have been reviewed and found acceptable. 2.8.3 Urine Urine shall be collected in sulphuric acid containing receptacles to stabilize the urine and prevent loss of nitrogen. Aliquots of urine from the collection period shall be freeze dried and pooled per animal in sufficient amount for GE assay. 2.9 Analytical Determination Prepared samples shall be used for analysis. AOAC approved analytical methodology shall be used when available or one of the recommended analytical methods listed Chapter V. Food and faeces shall be assayed for gross energy (bomb calorimetry), crude protein, and the indicator. If urine is collected, gross energy and crude protein in the urine should also be determined. If digestibility values of dry matter, fat or other nutrients are wanted, food and faeces should also be assayed for those substances. Food and faeces are analysed for the indicator by the same method (Atomic absorption spectrophotometry is the preferred method if chromic oxide is used as the indicator (Arthur 1970). Since controlled sample digestion and oxidation of the chromic oxide to chromates is critical for reproducible results, colorimetric analysis of chromium is less reproducible than atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Food, faeces and urine (if collected) are stored in the freezer in case of need for further analysis

2.10 Calculation of Digestible and Metabolizable Energy and Digestible Nutrients 1. Digestible energy & protein The determination is based on assays of the gross energy or crude protein consumed minus the energy or crude protein in the faeces. DE (kcal or kJ/g) =

{1 - (GE of faeces x % Cr2O3 in food) } x GE of food
(GE of food x % Cr2O3 in faeces)

DP (% food) =

{1 - (% CP in faeces x % Cr2O3 in food) } x CP in food
(% CP in food x % Cr2O3 in faeces)

Digestible fat, ash and dry matter can be calculated in the same way as digestible protein. 2. Metabolizable energy The determination is based on assays of the gross energy consumed minus the energy lost in faeces and in the urine. If urine is collected ME (kcal or kJ/g) = DE - GE of urine If urine is not collected ME (kcal or kJ/g) = DE - (DP x correction factor for energy lost in urine) Correction factor for energy lost in urine (Kienzle et al. 1998): 1.25 kcal or 5.23 kJ/g for dogs 0.86 kcal or 3.60 kJ/g for cats

The labels shall include the animal number, diet number, and dates of collection. Faeces shall be collected daily for a minimum of four days for dogs and five days for cats. Every effort should be made to collect all of the faeces and avoid collecting contaminants such as hair. The methodology is as follows: i) ii) Weigh collection container and record weight. Place faeces in the respective animal's container for that day of collection. Collect faeces as quantitatively as possible.

Urine shall be collected with a minimum of contamination, in a urine receptacle containing sulphuric acid to stabilize the urine and prevent nitrogen loss. After the total urine volume is determined, aliquot samples shall be freeze-dried in an appropriate container. 2.9 Analytical Determination Prepared samples shall be used for analysis. AOAC approved analytical methodology shall be used when available or one of the methods in Chapter V. Food, faeces and urine (if collected) shall be assayed for gross energy (bomb calorimetry). If urine is not collected, food and faeces also shall be assayed for crude protein. If digestibility values of dry matter, fat or other nutrients are wanted, food and faeces should also be assayed for those substances. 2.10 Calculation of Digestible Energy and digestible nutrients The determination is based on assays of the gross energy consumed minus the energy in the

Digestible fat, ash and dry matter can be calculated in the same way as digestible protein. 2.11 Calculation of Metabolizable Energy The determination is based on assays of the gross energy consumed minus the energy in the faeces and correction for energy lost in the urine (or energy lost in urine as determined by calorimetry). 2.11.1 Without urine collection ME = [(GE of food consumed - GE of faeces collected) – (grams protein consumed = (CP of food consumed - CP of faeces collected) x100/ amount of food

ANNEX I – Energy
1 Introduction The feeding guide, more than anything else on a pet food label, draws the attention of the consumer, to who the amount to feed is certainly key. Energy requirements vary considerably between individual dogs and cats, even between animals kept under the same conditions. This wide variation between individual animals can be the consequence of differences in age, breed, body size, body condition, insulation characteristics of skin and hair coat, temperament, health status or activity. It can also be caused by environmental factors such as ambient temperature and housing conditions (Meyer & Zentek 2005, NRC 2006). No single formula will allow to calculate the energy requirements for all dogs or cats (Heusner 1991), and every equation only predicts a theoretical average for a specific group of animals. Providing satisfactory feeding recommendations remains thus an ongoing challenge for pet food companies. The next section provides general recommendations for household dogs and cats and should be considered a starting point. The following discussion is intended to clarify some of the substantial differences seen between individual dogs or cats. 2 Abbreviations BCS Body condition score (lean, ideal, overweight, obese) BMR BW DE DER DM ECF GE kcal Basal metabolic rate Body weight Digestible energy Daily energy requirements Dry matter Extra cellular fluid Gross energy Kilocalorie NFE REE RER TNZ UCT kJ ME MJ MER Kilojoule Metabolizable energy Megajoule Maintenance requirements Nitrogen free extract Resting energy expenditure Resting energy requirements Thermo-neutral zone Upper critical temperature energy

Gross energy The gross energy (GE) of a food is defined as the total chemical combustible energy arising from complete combustion of a food in a bomb calorimeter (NRC 2006a). The predicted GE values of protein, fat and carbohydrate are listed in table 1. Table 1. Predicted gross energy values of protein, fat and carbohydrate Nutrient Crude protein Fat NFE + Crude fibre 5.7 kcal/g 9.4 kcal/g 4.1 kcal/g Gross Energy 23.8 kJ/g 39.3 kJ/g 17.1 kJ/g

(Kienzle et al. 2002; NRC 2006a) NFE = nitrogen free extract

kcal GE/100g = 5.7 x % crude protein + 9.4 x % crude fat + 4.1 x (% NFE + % crude fibre) kJ GE/100g = 23.8 x % crude protein + 39.3 x % crude fat + 17.1 x (% NFE + % crude fibre) Metabolizable energy Digestible energy and metabolizable energy are a more accurate way of expressing the energy density of a food. Metabolizable energy reflects better the energy that is utilised by the animal, but is more difficult to determine. The metabolizable energy (ME) of a pet food is measured most accurately by performing digestibility trials using one of the two methods described in Chapter VI. The metabolizable energy can also be predicted by calculation from the average analysis using one of the equations hereafter. However, since the digestibility can differ between pet foods, a single equation can not be supposed to predict the ME of all pet food products. a) Atwater factors For processed pet foods “modified” Atwater factors can be used; they are based on an average digestibility of 90% for fat, 85% for carbohydrate (NFE) and 80% for protein (NRC 1985b). kcal ME /100g = % crude protein x 3.5 + % crude fat x 8.5 + % NFE x 3.5 (AAFCO 2008) kJ ME /100g = % crude protein x 14.65 + % crude fat x 35.56 + % NFE x 14.65 The factors developed by Atwater in 1902 work well for human food ingredients such as meat, fish and purified starch products) and can also be used for processed pet foods with a very high digestibility, milk substitutes and liquids for enteral nutrition (NRC 2006a). kcal ME /100g = % crude protein x 4.0 + % crude fat x 9.0 + % NFE x 4.0 kJ ME /100g = % crude protein x 16.74 + % crude fat x 37.66 + % NFE x 16.74

More accurate predictive equations for pet foods are discussed below: b) Predictive Equations for ME in foods for dogs and cats For calculation of ME in prepared pet foods for cats and dogs (dry and wet) the following 4-step-calculation can be used (NRC 2006a): 1. Calculate GE GE (kcal) = (5.7 x g protein) + (9.4 x g fat) + [4.1 x (g NFE + g crude fibre)] GE (kJ) = (23.85 x g protein) + (39.33 x g fat) + [17.15 x (g NFE + g crude fibre)] 2. Calculate energy digestibility (%): Dogs: % energy digestibility = 91.2 – (1.43 x % crude fibre in DM) Cats: % energy digestibility = 87.9 – (0.88 x % crude fibre in DM) 3. Calculate digestible energy: kcal DE = (kcal GE x energy digestibilty) / 100 kJ DE = (kJ GE x energy digestibilty) / 100 4. Convert into metabolizable energy: Dogs: kcal ME = kcal DE – (1.04 x g protein) kJ ME = kJ DE – (4.35 x g protein) Cats: kcal ME = kcal DE – (0.77 x g protein) kJ ME = kJ DE – (3.22 x g protein) This calculation is not suitable for milk substitutes and liquid preparations for enteral nutrition and may be inaccurate for foods with a crude fibre content of more than eight per cent. c) Determination of ME content of foods by feeding trials

Manufacturers should be aware that feeding trials are regarded as the gold standard for determination of the energy content of any pet food. Using the trials described in Chapter VI the digestible energy (DE) can be accurately measured. An approximate factor to convert digestible into metabolizable energy is 0.9. Alternatively, NRC 2006 recommends subtracting 1.25 kcal g-1 digestible crude protein (5.23 kJ g-1) for dogs and 0.9 kcal g-1 (3.77 kJ g-1) for cats (NRC 2006a). FEDIAF recommends that members who wish to use feeding trials should employ the quantitative collection protocol published in Chapter VI. 4 Literature review on energy requirements of dogs

While the formulae give average metabolizable energy needs, actual needs of cats and dogs may vary greatly depending on various factors (Meyer & Zentek 2005, NRC 1985 & 2006). Energy allowances, recommended for maintenance of adult dogs, differ widely, with figures ranging from less than 90 kcal ME/kg0.75 (377 kJ) to approximately 200 kcal ME/kg0.75 (810 kJ).

This diversity is not surprising when we consider the variation in adult size between the different breeds, which, with mature body weights ranging from one kg (Chihuahua) to 90 kg or more (St. Bernard), is the greatest diversity across mammalian species (Lauten 2006). The amount of energy a particular dog will finally need is significantly influenced by factors such as age, breed, size, activity, environment, temperament, insulation characteristics of skin and hair coat, body condition or disease. 4.1 Maintenance Energy Requirements (MER) of adult dogs Energy requirements of animals with widely differing body weights are not correlated with kg body weight (BW) in a linear way (Meyer & Heckötter 1986, NRC 1985). Energy requirements are more closely related to BW raised to some power: The daily energy requirements of dogs most often are calculated in function of a metabolic weight, which equals kg 0.75. Its accuracy for dogs has been questioned, and a valid alternative (kg 0.67) is more related to body surface, and may thus better reflect heat production (Finke 1994, Kienzle & Rainbird 1991, Männer 1991). What such an equation tells you is the expected mean value for a “typical dog of the given size”. We will continue to use the kg0.75, which is also recommended by NRC 2006. It is widely accepted and easy to calculate by cubing BW and then taking its square root twice (Lewis et al. 1987a). Maintenance energy requirement (MER) is the amount of energy expended by a moderately active adult animal. It consists of the basal metabolic rate (BMR) plus the energy cost for obtaining, digesting and absorbing food in amounts that are necessary to maintain BW. It includes calories for spontaneous (inevitable) activity, and, in case of passing the critical temperature, energy needed to maintain normal body temperature (Meyer & Zentek 2005, Rainbird & Kienzle 1989). Independent from BW, MER is influenced by differences in age, type and breed, activity, temperament, environmental temperature, insulation characteristics of skin (i.e. hair length and subcutaneous fat), and social environment, among which “age and activity“ appeared to be the most important contributors to individual energy needs (Burger 1994, Finke 1994, Kienzle & Rainbird 1991, Meyer & Heckötter 1986, NRC 1985). Recommendations for MER may overestimate energy needs by 10 to 60 % (Männer 1991, NRC 2006a). They often include a reasonable amount for activity, whereas approximately 19 per cent of the owners never play with their dogs, and 22 per cent let their dogs out for exercise for less than three hours a week (Slater et al. 1995). 4.2 Activity It is clear that spontaneous activity significantly influences MER; for example, standing up requires 40 per cent more energy than lying down (Meyer and Zentek 2005). However,

recommendations for MER do not always mention the degree of activity included, whilst it is

47/75

Publication – July 2012

important that activity is taken into account when calculating the energy needs of an individual animal. Indeed, average recommendations could be too high for about one out of four dogs, since almost a quarter of the owners exercise their dogs less than three hours a week (Slater et al. 1995). To avoid overfeeding and the risk of obesity, it may be better to start from a lower calculated MER and add as needed to maintain optimal body weight. 4.3 Age Apart from lactation and imposed activity during work or sport, age may be the single mostimportant factor influencing MER of most household dogs (Finke 1994). Three groups of adult dogs can be distinguished: dogs of one to two years old, the average adult dog (three to seven years old) and dogs of more than seven years of age (Finke 1994 & 1991, Kienzle & Rainbird 1991). Young adult dogs, under two years of age, require more energy because they are more active and despite a body weight similar to that of older individuals of the same breed, may still be developing (Meyer & Zentek 2005, Rainbird & Kienzle 1989). Older

animals need fewer calories because of decreased activity (Finke 1991, Meyer & Zentek 2005). In some dogs, however, calorie needs may further decrease as a consequence of an increase in subcutaneous fat and a decrease in body temperature (Meyer & Zentek 2005). Dogs over seven years of age may need 10 - 15 per cent less energy than at three to seven years (Finke 1994, Kienzle & Rainbird 1991). Therefore, practical recommendations should always be related to age (Finke 1994, Gesellschaft für Ernährungsphysiologie 1989a). The age at which a dog’s activity decreases can differ according to breed and between individuals. Most of the assessed scientific work uses the age of seven years as a cut-off point, but this should not be regarded as a general rule. 4.4 Breed & Type It has been shown that some breeds such as Newfoundland dogs and huskies have relatively lower energy requirements, while Great Danes have a MER above the average (Kienzle & Rainbird 1991, Rainbird & Kienzle 1989, Zentek & Meyer 1992). Breed-specific needs

probably reflect differences in temperament, resulting in higher or lower activity, as well as variation in stature or insulation capacity of skin and hair coat, which influences the degree of heat loss. However, when data are corrected for age, inter-breed differences become less important (Finke 1994). Yet NRC 2006 reports Newfoundland dogs, Great Danes and terriers as breeds with energy requirements outlying the predictive range (NRC 2006a). 4.5 Thermoregulation and Housing Cool environment increases animals’ energy expenditure (Blaza 1982, Finke 1991, Meyer & Zentek 2005, NRC 1985, Walters et al.1993). When kept outside in winter, dogs may need 10

48/75

Publication – July 2012

to 90 per cent more calories than during summer. Energy needed for maintaining body temperature is minimal at a temperature called the thermo-neutral zone (TNZ). The TNZ is species and breed specific and is lower when the thermal insulation is better. The TNZ has been estimated to be 15-20°C for long-haired dog breeds and 20-25°C for short haired dog breeds; it may be as low as 10-15°C for Alaskan Huskies (Kleiber 1961b, Männer 1991, Meyer & Zentek 2005, Zentek & Meyer 1992). Besides insulation capacity, the energy expenditure also depends on differences in stature, behaviour and activity during cold weather, and degree of acclimatisation (Finke 1991, Meyer & Zentek 2005, NRC 1985, Zentek & Meyer 1992), as well as on air movement and air humidity (McNamara 1989, Meyer & Zentek 2005). Animals kept together may decrease the rate of heat loss by huddling together; this phenomenon is very important for neonates (Kleiber 1961b). During exposure to heat, the basal metabolic rate cannot be lowered (Ruckebusch et al. 1984). If the environmental temperature increases above the upper critical temperature (UCT), the animal has to get rid of the heat by either increasing blood flow to the surface (vasodilatation) or enhanced evaporation of water (panting), which also costs energy (Kleiber 1961b). Vasodilatation becomes ineffective when the environmental is equal to the rectal temperature (Kleiber 1961b). The UCT for adult dogs seems to be 30 to 35 °C (NRC 2006b). Individually housed dogs, with little opportunity to move, may have daily energy requirements (DER) as low as 70 kcal ME/kg0.75. When housed in kennels together with other dogs and a lot of mutual interaction, which stimulates activity, DER may rise to over 144 kcal ME/kg 0.75 (602.5 kJ/kg0.75) (NRC 2006a). Diet-induced thermogenesis plays a small role; it represents about 10 per cent of the daily energy expenditure in dogs. It increases with diets rich in protein and is greater in dogs fed four meals per day than in dogs fed once daily (NRC 2006a). 5. Practical recommendations for daily energy intake by dogs and cats in different physiological states As mentioned before, it is impossible to have one equation which expresses the energy requirements for every individual animal. Since the energy requirement of an individual

animal may differ from the average shown in the tables, these recommendations should only be used as starting points, and the owner has to adapt the amount when the animal tend to lose or gain weight. 5.1. Dogs

Tables 2-4 provide practical recommendations for maintenance energy requirements (MER) of adult dogs at different ages (TABLE 2), energy needed in relation to activity (TABLE 3) or for growth and reproduction (TABLE 4).

The values shown in Table 2 are only starting points, the amount of energy a particular dog will finally need is significantly influenced by other factors such as activity, environment, breed, temperament, insulation characteristics of skin and hair coat, body condition or disease.

Table 2 provides MER at different ages without taking into account the degree of activity. However, some young adult dogs may have a sedentary lifestyle and need fewer calories than the average shown in table 2, whereas older dogs (> 7 years of age) which are still playing and running will need more energy than indicated. Table 3 provides an example of the daily requirements of dogs at different levels of activity. Although mainly based on data from one breed (border collies), table 3 is a good alternative to table 2 to estimate the energy requirements of adult dogs in relation to their level of activity.

Recommendations for DER in relation to activity Activity level Low activity (< 1 h/day) (e.g. walking on the lead) Moderate activity (1 – 3 h/day) (e.g. playing, off the lead) High activity (3 – 6 h/day) (working dogs, e.g. sheep dogs) High activity under extreme conditions (racing sled dogs

In addition, when dogs are housed at an ambient temperature, which is below or over their specific thermo-neutral zone, MER increases by 2-5 kcal (8-21 kJ) per kg0.75 for every degree

calculate the average energy needs of lactating bitches at different stages of lactation.

Overfeeding puppies can result in skeletal deformities especially in large and giant breeds (Dämmrich 1991, Kealy et al. 1992; Meyer & Zentek 1992; Richardson & Toll 1993). Therefore, puppies should never be fed ad libitum and weight gain closely monitored. 5.2. Cats

Owing to the small variation in adult body weights, the energy needs of cats can be expressed per kg BW instead of per kg metabolic weight. In addition, if metabolic weight is used to calculate MER with the intra-specific allometric coefficient of 0.67 proposed by Heusner in 1991 should be used (NRC 2006a), which has recently been confirmed to be a more accurate than the 0.75 (Nguyen et al. 2001; Edtstadtler-Pietsch 2003). The equation of 100 kcal (418 kJ) ME per kg0.67 proposed by NRC 2006 corresponds with a

51/75

Publication – July 2012

daily energy intake of about 60-70 kcal (250-290 kJ) ME per kg body weight. Although NRC specifies that this equation is only valid for cats with a lean body condition, many lean cats may need less energy (Riond et al. 2003, Wichert et al. 2007). Therefore it is justified to recommend a range that starts at 80 kcal (335 kJ) ME per kg 0.67 [about 50-60 kcal (210-250 kJ) ME per kg body weight]. Particularly for neutered cats and cats living indoors energy requirements may be substantially lower.

ANNEX II – TAURINE
Introduction Taurine (2-Aminoethanesulfonic acid = NH2CH2-CH2-SO3H) is a -aminosulfonic acid rather than an α-carboxylic amino acid (Huxtable ‘92). It was first isolated from the bile of the ox “Bos Taurus” and was named after it (Huxtable ‘92). Dogs and cats exclusively use taurine to conjugate bile acids. In dogs the rate of taurine synthesis appears to be adequate to meet the needs, if their food contains adequate amounts of sulphur-containing amino acids. In cats, the ability to synthesize taurine is limited and insufficient to compensate for the natural losses via the conjugated bile acid (taurocholic acid) in the gastrointestinal tract. Hence taurine is an essential nutrient for the cat. 1 Cat Taurine deficiency can lead to feline central retinal degeneration, dilated cardiomyopathy and reproductive failure. Taurine intake is considered to be adequate when plasma levels are greater than 50-60 µmol/L (Pion et al. ‘87, Douglas et al. ’91) or the whole blood concentration 200 µmol/L or higher (Fox ‘00). In the late 1980s, the feeding of commercial cat foods containing levels of taurine that were considered to be adequate [based on studies with purified diets (Burger et al. ’82, NRC ’86)] resulted in low plasma taurine levels in cats, and were associated with retinal degeneration and dilated cardiomyopathy (Pion et al.1987). Taurine is not degraded by mammalian enzymes, but is excreted as such in the urine or in the form of taurocholate or related bile acids via the gastrointestinal tract (Huxtable ’92, Odle et al. ’93). However, balance studies have indicated that taurine is can be degraded by the intestinal microflora (Morris et al. ’94). The composition of the cat food, as well as the type of production process influence this intestinal degradation (Morris et al. ’94). Hickman et al. showed that heat-processed cat foods resulted in lower taurine plasma levels and greater losses compared to the same food but frozen-preserved (Hickman et al. ’90 & ’92). This was the consequence of increased sensitivity of taurine to intestinal bacterial degradation owing to the heat processing (Morris et al. ’94). For this reason the recommendation for taurine in canned cat food is higher than that for dry food or purified diets. 2 Dog Healthy dogs synthesize sufficient taurine from dietary sulphur-containing amino acids such as methionine and cysteine. Nevertheless, low plasma or low whole-blood taurine levels may be seen in dogs fed non-supplemented very-low protein diets, or foods that are low in sulphurcontaining amino acids or with poor availability of the sulphur-containing amino acids

(Sanderson et al. ’01, Backus et al. ‘03). Feeding certain lamb and rice foods may increase the risk of a low-taurine status, because of lower bioavailability of sulphur-containing amino acids and increased faecal losses of taurine possibly caused by rice bran (Backus et al. ’03, Delaney et al. ’03, Fascetti et al. ’03, Torres et al. ’03). In dogs, low plasma levels of taurine (<40µmol/L) may also predispose to dilated cardiomyopathy (Pion et al. ‘98). However, some breeds seem to be more sensitive to develop such side effects (Pion et al. ‘98), particularly Newfoundland dogs, in which the rate of taurine synthesis is decreased (Backus et al. ’06). The addition of taurine to such foods or increasing the intake of the precursors of taurine (methionine and cysteine) can prevent such a decrease (Backus et al. ’03, Torres et al. ’03). In dogs, adequate levels of taurine are values greater than 40µmol/L in plasma and greater than 200µmol/L in whole blood (Elliott et al. 2000). 3 Conclusion The taurine values for cats, stated in the tables B1,2,3 (Chapter III), are starting points. Individual companies can have different levels of taurine in their products as long as they ensure that the products maintain adequate blood value in the cat's body (plasma levels should be greater than 50/60 µmol/l, > 200 µmol/L in whole blood). For dogs dietary taurine is not essential, since dogs can synthesize taurine from sulphur amino acids, therefore dog foods should formulated to maintain adequate body reserves of taurine (> 40µmol/L in plasma and >200µmol/L in whole blood). Analytical methods for taurine are given in Chapter V. References

ANNEX III – ARGININE
The arginine requirement increases with increased protein content owing to its role as an intermediate in the urea cycle. The NRC 2006 advises an extra 0.01 g arginine for every 1% increase in protein (% DM) above the recommended allowance for all life stages in dogs, and an extra 0.02 g arginine (dogs) for every 1% increase in protein for cats. The following tables outline the arginine recommendations for various protein contents. All values are stated as g/100 g DM.

ANNEX V – AdVERSE REACTIONS TO FOOD I. Introduction
Adverse food reactions in cats and dogs are mainly expressed by pruritus and gastrointestinal signs. Acute anaphylactic reactions such as those seen in a minority of people who are allergic to nuts and some other foods have not been reported in relation to pet food.

II. Definitions
1. Adverse reactions to food An adverse reaction to a food is an abnormal or exaggerated clinical response to the ingestion of a food or food additive. It may be immune mediated (called food allergy or hypersensitivity) or not immune mediated (called food intolerance) (Reedy et al. 1997).

2. Food allergy Allergy immune-mediated reaction resulting in one or more of the clinical signs described under “IV. Adverse reactions to food in dogs and cats“ Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is an acute life-threatening multi-system allergic reaction resulting from exposure to an offending agent. In people, foods, insect stings, and medication are the most common causes (Tang 2003, Oswalt et al. 2007, Wang et al. 2007). The term has been variably employed to

62/75

Publication – July 2012

denote a defined IgE-mediated antigen-induced reaction or as a descriptive term delineating a severe, abrupt, untoward event of un-stated immunologic significance (Wasserman 1983).

3. Non-allergic food hypersensitivity Food idiosyncrasy: a non-immune mediated reaction to a food component that causes clinical signs resembling an immune-mediated reaction to food (food allergy) Metabolic reaction: Food intolerance. An adverse reaction caused by a metabolic defect (e.g. lactose intolerance). 5. All individuals susceptible if sufficient quantity eaten Toxic reaction: Reaction to a toxic food component (e.g. onions)

Microbiological reaction: Reaction to a toxin released by contaminating organisms (e.g. mycotoxins) Pharmacologic reaction: adverse reaction to a food as result of a naturally derived or added chemical producing a drug-like or pharmacological effect in the host such as methylxanthines in chocolate or pseudo-allergic reactions caused by high histamine levels in not well-preserved scromboid fish (tuna or salmon). Dietary indiscretion: Adverse reaction resulting from such behaviour as gluttony, pica or ingestion of various indigestible materials or garbage. III. Food allergy in man Food allergies are the single most common cause of generalised anaphylaxis seen in hospital emergency departments, accounting for about one third of cases seen (twice the number of cases seen for bee stings) (Sampson ‘99). It is estimated that about 100 fatal cases of foodinduced anaphylaxis occur in the US each year (Sampson ‘99). The most common allergens causing anaphylaxis in people are nuts, shellfish, milk, egg white, legumes, certain fruits, grains, chocolate, and fish (Wasserman ’83). As far as we are aware of, cases of allergies in humans related to ingestion or contact with pet foods are not reported in the literature. IV. Adverse reactions to food in cats and dogs The predominant clinical sign in dogs and cats (almost 100% of the cases) is pruritus (itching) (Rosser ’90, White ’86, White ’89, Scott et al. 2001). The pruritus can be generalised or localised, sometimes being restricted to recurrent otitis. Other dermatological changes such

63/75

Publication – July 2012

seborrhoea, recurrent pyoderma or Malassezia can be seen in allergic dogs (White ’86, Scott et al. 2001). In allergic cats eosinophilic plaque, miliary dermatitis or alopecia caused by excessive grooming can the only clinical sign present (White ’86, Scott et al. 2001). An estimated 10 to 15 % of the cases of food allergy in dogs and cats are believed to result into gastrointestinal (GI) signs such as: diarrhoea and vomiting (Scott et al. 2001). However, the GI signs can be very discrete (e.g. more frequent bowel movements (Scott et al. 2001) and their prevalence may be underestimated (Loeffler ). In cats and dogs immune mediated reactions are seldom confirmed in practice. Therefore, the term adverse reactions to food is generally accepted and used for cats and dogs. In dogs and cats, adverse reactions to food are only diagnosed through the elimination of the food component (eviction diet) following either dermatological or digestive symptoms (or both). Ideally this should be confirmed by a challenge (reintroduction of the suspected component) after clinical signs have disappeared when feeding the eviction diet. (Wills J. ’94, Helm 2002) Adverse reactions to food are deemed to account for about 1-5 % of all skin conditions in dogs and 1-6% of all feline dermatoses (animal presented to veterinary practices) (Reedy et al. ‘97). Most food ingredients have the potential to induce adverse reactions because they contain intact proteins. Now, intact proteins are part of all products made by our industry including all pet foods (except special diets with hydrolysed proteins as the sole source of protein). All products containing intact protein can potentially cause allergic/adverse reactions in predisposed animals (ref 13). There are proteins against which dogs and cats seem to react more often (Wills ‘94). Milk, beef, eggs, cereals and dairy products are mentioned most often whereas more controlled studies mentioned wheat, soy, chicken and maize as the most important allergens. However, it is not always clear whether these data are taken over from human literature or not. In addition, the data do not always enable to see whether the high incidence is not simply the consequence of the fact that those proteins have been eaten more frequently by dogs and cats. Through veterinarians, special diets made with selected protein sources or hydrolysed proteins are available for dogs and cats suffering of adverse reactions to food; the formulation and the label declarations for those foods are regulated by the specific EU legislation on dietetic foods for animals. V. Conclusions  Most protein containing ingredients have the potential to induce allergic reactions if they are regularly fed to dogs and cats.



Anaphylactic reactions to food as seen in humans are not, as far as we know, reported in literature relating to cats and dogs. The hallmark of adverse reaction in dogs and cats to food is pruritus.

ANNEX VI – RISK OF SOME HUMAN FOODS REGULARLY GIVEN TO PETS Annex VI provides some practical information about some common human foods (such as raisins, grapes, onions, garlic and chocolate) with documented adverse effects when given to dogs or cats either as a treat or when left over from the table are shared with pets. This annex lists signs that should alert pet owners and combines information that is not easily found in one place or has only been available recently. There may be other foods that are potentially hazardous when fed to dogs or cats, but they are not yet documented. 1. GRAPE AND RAISIN TOXICITY IN DOGS Background Since 1989 the Animal Poison Control Centre (APCC) of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has recorded cases of poisoning in dogs that had eaten grapes (Vitis spp) or raisins. From April 2003 to April 2004 the APCC managed 140 cases, of which 50 dogs developed clinical signs and seven died (ASPCA, 2004). Cases have been reported in the USA and the UK (Eubig et al. 2005, Penny et al. 2003) Clinical signs and pathology Affected dogs typically suffer gastrointestinal upset followed by acute renal failure (ARF). The initial signs of grape or raisin toxicity are vomiting (100% of reported cases) followed by lethargy, anorexia, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, ataxia, and weakness (Eubig et al. 2005). In the majority of dogs, vomiting, anorexia, lethargy and diarrhoea occur within the first 24 hours of exposure, in some cases vomiting starts as early as 5 to 6 hours after ingestion (Eubig et al. 2005). The vomit and or faeces may contain partially digested grapes or raisins or swollen raisins. Classic signs of ARF can develop within 24 hours or up to several days later. These include substantial increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, as well as in the calcium x phosphorus product, serum phosphorus and later in total calcium level (Eubig et al. 2005). If the condition progresses, the dog eventually is unable to pass urine. At this stage the

prognosis is generally poor and usually a decision is taken to euthanize the animal. The most consistent histopathological lesions reported were diffuse renal tubular degeneration, especially in the proximal tubules (Eubig et al. 2005). Mineralization of necrotic renal structures has been reported, but also tubular cell regeneration in some cases. Mineralization and/or congestion of extra-renal tissues and organs have also been observed (Eubig et al. 2005). It has to be pointed out, however, that many dogs never develop AFR after ingestion of raisins or grapes.

Toxic agent The toxic agent (or agents) has so far defied detection. Analysis for a variety of substances has proved negative, including mycotoxins, heavy metals, pesticides and vitamin D3 (AFIP 2003, Eubig et al. 2005). It is postulated that the cause may be a nephrotoxin or anaphylactic shock leading to renal problems (AFIP 2003). Excess sugar intake has also been suggested, resulting in a disturbance of sugar metabolism, but this seems unlikely as dogs are not known for susceptibilities to high sugar intake. The poisoning seems to occur with grapes and raisins of all types: those purchased from a store or grown at home, grape pressings from wineries and seedless and seeded varieties (Eubig et al. 2005). Grape extract is not considered a threat; the grape or raisin itself has to be eaten for poisoning to occur (McKnight, 2005). The lowest intake that has so far been reported to cause poisoning is around 2.8g of raisins per kg bodyweight (BW) and 19.6 g of grapes per kg BW; one dog became ill after only eating 10 to 12 grapes (Eubig et al. 2005). The severity of the illness does not seem to be doserelated (Eubig et al. 2005). Even a large dog of 40 kg may need to eat only 120 g to be at risk and as cartons of raisins typically contain 500g this amount could be ingested in one session. At present it appears that only dogs are affected – the susceptibility of other species is unknown. Treatment Immediate treatment consists of inducing emesis and lavage of the stomach to remove the poison, followed by decontamination using activated charcoal to inactivate the remaining poison. Aggressive fluid therapy is essential to increase the chances of survival, and should be maintained long enough (at least 48 hours). Haemodialysis and diuretics such as

furosemide have been recommended to treat the ARF and oliguria (McKnight, 2005), but do not seem to increase survival substantially (Eubig et al. 2005). References

2. CHOCOLATE TOXICITY Background Cocoa poisoning was highlighted during the Second World War, when pigs, calves, dogs and horses were poisoned because by-products of cacao beans were used to supplement feeds as a result of a surplus. Chocolate is palatable to most dogs, but it is not an innocent snack being relatively toxic. In dogs signs of toxicity may develop within hours after consumption. In addition, chocolate cakes and other cocoa containing human foods are best avoided. It is not surprising that most accidents are reported during holiday periods such as Christmas and Easter (Campbell 2001). Chocolate treats specially developed for dogs are not toxic as they are made from ingredients that contain low or no theobromine. No reports of chocolate poisoning in cats have been published to our knowledge, probably as a consequence of their different eating habits. Toxic agent The principle toxic components of chocolate and cocoa products are the methylxanthine alkaloids, of which theobromine is the major toxin (Campbell 2001). As long ago as 1917, cacao bean shell intoxication in horses was attributed to theobromine by French researchers. Theobromine is particularly toxic to dogs, because its elimination is very slow compared with the rate in other species such as man (Hooser ’84, Glauberg ’83). The half life of theobromine in dogs is about 17.5 hours (Farbman 2001, Hooser & Beasley ’86). Theobromine undergoes enterohepatic recirculation resulting in an accumulative effect (Campbell 2001, Farbman 2001). As a consequence, repeated intakes of smaller (non-toxic) quantities may still cause intoxication. The slow elimination of theobromine is also responsible for decreased survival rate in affected dogs and death may still occur at a stage when clinical signs are already attenuating (Strachan & Bennett ’94). Caffeine is another methylxanthine present in cocoa products, and may contribute to the toxicity. However, the levels of caffeine in cocoa products are much lower than those of theobromine and the half life is much shorter (4.5 hours) (Farbman 2001, Hooser & Beasley ’86). The LD50 of theobromine has been reported to be between 250mg and 500mg per kg body weight (BW); lethal cases have been seen when dogs ingested amounts of chocolate that reflect an estimated theobromine intake of 90-115 mg/kg BW (Glauberg ’83, Hooser & Beasley ’86, Carson TL 2001). The level of theobromine content of chocolate varies, with dark chocolate containing the highest level (TABLE 1). Unsweetened baking chocolate should definitely be kept out of reach

of dogs, since it contains up to 20 mg of theobromine per gram. Dogs also voluntarily eat cocoa powder, in which the average theobromine level varies from 10 to 30 mg/g (Sutton ‘81). About four grams of cocoa powder per kg BW may be sufficient to kill a dog (Faliu ’91). Increasingly cocoa shell mulches are used to prevent weeds and for landscaping in gardens. They are often attractive to dogs because of the chocolate smell and therefore may be a potential cause of theobromine poisoning (Hansen et al. 2003). Table 1.

Clinical signs In dogs methylxanthines cause stimulation of the central nervous system with tachycardia (fast heart beating), respiratory stress and hyperactivity (Campbell 2001, Farbman 2001). The clinical signs include vomiting, diarrhoea, agitation, muscular tremors and weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions, and, in severe cases, renal damage, coma and death (Glauberg ’83, Decker ’72, Nicholson ’95, Farbman 2001, Hooser & Beasley ‘86). Death may occur within six to 15 hours after intake of excessive amounts of chocolate or cocoa products (Glauberg ‘83, Decker ’72, Drolet et al. ‘84). At necropsy, congestion in liver, kidneys, pancreas and the gastro-intestinal tract are seen, as well as unclotted haemorrhagic fluid in peritoneal and thoracic cavities (Sutton ’81, Strachan & Bennett ‘94). Treatment No specific antidote is available for theobromine, only symptomatic treatment. In order to minimise the absorption of theobromine vomiting can be induced immediately after ingestion. Subsequently lavage can be applied with warm water to keep the chocolate liquid. Repeated doses of activated charcoal can then be used to bind the remaining material and prevent further absorption and increase excretion (Glauberg ’83, Hooser & Beasley ’86, Farbman 2001, Carson 2001).

3. TOXICITY OF ONIONS AND GARLIC IN CATS & DOGS Background It has been known since 1930 that dogs are very sensitive to onions (Allium spp) whether raw, cooked or dehydrated. Clinical signs and pathology Regenerative anaemia with marked Heinz body formation has been reported in cats and dogs after eating onions or onion containing foods (Harvey et al. ‘85, Kaplan ’95, Robertson et al. ’98, Spice ’76, Tvedten et al. ’96,). Consumption of a sufficient amount of onions leads to oxidative injury of the lipid membrane of the erythrocytes and irreversible oxidative denaturation of haemoglobin. This results in formation of Heinz bodies, eccentrocytes (red blood cells with haemoglobin clustering at one side of the cell), haemolytic anaemia, haemoglobinuria, increased serum bilirubin and possibly methaemoglobinaemia (Faliu ’91, Cope ‘05, Harvey et al. ‘85, Kaplan ’95, Lee et al. ‘00, Robertson et al. ’98, Means ‘02). Relatively small amounts of fresh onions (5 to 10 g/kg BW) can already be toxic (Faliu ’91, Cope ‘05). Robertson et al. ’98 showed that effect was dose dependent. The clinical signs are secondary to the anaemia and include pale mucous membranes, tachycardia, tachypnoea, lethargy and weakness (Gfeller & Messonier ’98, Cope ‘05).

70/75

Publication – July 2012

Vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain may also be present. If only a moderate amount of onions has been eaten, the Heinz body anaemia resolves spontaneously after discontinuing the onions (Kaplan ’95, Robertson et al. ‘98). In more severe cases, icterus and renal failure can be seen as a consequence of the haemolysis and haemoglobinuria respectively, and possibly death (Ogawa et al. ’86, Cope ‘05). Although onion ingestion has been reported as being the most common cause of Heinz body haemolysis in dogs (Weiser ’95), it may be difficult to correlate clinical signs with the onion ingestion because of the lag of several days before the onset of clinical signs (Weiser ’95, Cope ‘05). Although onion poisoning is more common in dogs, cats are more sensitive to onion and garlic poisoning owing to their specific haemoglobin structure, making them more susceptible to oxidative stress (Giger ‘00). Garlic and Chinese chives have also been reported to cause the development of Heinz bodies, eccentrocytes a, haemolytic anaemia and increases in methaemoglobin levels in dogs (Lee et al. ‘00, Yamato et al. ‘05). Lee et al. reported toxic effects after administration 1.25 ml of garlic extract per kg BW (equivalent to 5g/kg BW of whole garlic) for 7 days, this is similar to the amounts reported in onion poisoning. The increase in reduced glutathione (G-SH), which has been reported after ingestion of onions and garlic, may seem inconsistent with oxidative damage, but the increase can be a compensatory rebound reaction after an initial decrease in G-SH and other body anti-oxidants, and an increase in oxidised glutathione (GSSG) within the first few days (Yamoto ’92, Ogawa et al. ‘86). Dogs with hereditary high erythrocyte concentrations of reduced glutathione and potassium appear to be more sensitive to onion and garlic poisoning (Yamato et al. ’92). Wild onions (A. validum & A. Canadense), and wild garlic (A. ursinum) have caused haemolytic anaemia in horses and ruminants (Lee et al. ‘00) and are potentially toxic for dogs and cats as well. Toxic agents Several organo-sulfoxides have been implicated in toxicity induced by onions and garlic (TABLE 2). Miyata reported the extraction from onions of an unnamed phenolic compound causing similar effects on red blood cells “in vitro” (Miyata ’90). Allicin, a compound found in garlic, is similar to n-propyl disulfide found in onions (Gfeller & Messonier ‘98). These organosulfur compounds are readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and metabolised to highly reactive oxidants (Cope ‘05).

Oxygen therapy, fluid therapy (particularly crystalloids) and blood transfusion have been recommended (Gfeller & Messonier ‘98). Induction of vomiting can be useful within the first hour after ingestion of onions if the patient does not yet show clinical signs (Gfeller & Messonier ‘98). Anti-oxidant vitamins such as vitamins E and C may have subclinical beneficial effects that help in milder cases, but a study in cats did not show a significant effect on the formation of Heinz bodies (Hill et al. ‘01).

                                      Introduction



                 “Positive reinforcement works great on easy dogs, but it’s not
                 really effective on severe aggression cases, is it?”
                       As one of the world’s most vocal proponents of force-free dog
                 training methods, I get asked this type of question frequently, usu-
                 ally by people who are pretty sure they already know the answer.
                 Over the past several decades, science and history have taught
                 us so much about how dogs think, feel, and learn, yet some dog
                 trainers and owners still believe the only way to communicate
                 effectively with a difficult dog is to “teach it who’s boss” and force
                 it into some mythical state called “calm submission.” The issues
                 arising from this common and fundamental misunderstanding of
                 our canine companions are what motivate me every day to con-
                 tinue my work as a dog behavior consultant and educator.
                       There are many different terms used to describe the type of
                 teaching methods I use: positive reinforcement, reward-based, force-
                 free, and more. Proponents of these interrelated philosophies have
                 a shared belief that it is much safer, more effective, and humane
                 to teach animals using this overarching concept: If you reward
                 a behavior you like, it is more likely that that behavior will be




                                                   1




Stil_9781607744146_3p_all_r1.indd 1                                                   1/31/13 1:06 PM
                                           Train Your Dog Positively


             repeated. Similarly, if you ignore or redirect a behavior you don’t
             like, it is more likely that incidences of that behavior will decrease.
                  That’s a very simplistic synopsis of what reward-based train-
             ing is and how it works, but that general concept lays the founda-
             tion for everything a dog owner needs to know to build a healthy
             relationship with any dog. Combine this concept with an aware-
             ness that dogs are not wolves trying to dominate us, so do not
             need to be controlled using dominance-based punishment tech-
             niques, and you have the recipe for what I call positive training
             throughout this book.*
                  Unfortunately (but predictably), those who still promote puni-
             tive, outdated traditional training methods aren’t going quietly.
             There is a fierce debate raging in the dog training world between
             these two camps, and as a result, positive trainers regularly hear
             the same old tired arguments and accusations:
                •	There’s more than one way to train a dog.
                •	Reward-based training methods don’t work on severe behav-
                  ior problems such as aggression.
                •	Dogs only “respect” leaders who assert their “dominance.”
                •	Force-free trainers don’t use discipline.
                •	Training a dog with food is tantamount to bribery.
                •	If you train a dog using food, he or she will respond only
                  when you’re holding treats.


                * Note that use of the word positive in this case does not reflect the strict scien-
                   tific description of the word as defined among the four quadrants of operant
                   conditioning. For example, positive punishment is the addition of punishment
                   during training, and I obviously do not condone or include such methods in
                   my definition of the term positive training as I use it for the purposes of this
                   book. Throughout this book, I refer to myself and others like me as positive
                   trainers, and in doing so, I am referring to the same combination of reward-
                   based training methods and non–dominance/punishment/alpha hierarchy
                   awareness, not the scientific definition of the word.

                                             Introduction


                     •	Dogs that misbehave or show aggression are trying to be
                       dominant.
                     •	Dogs are pack animals like wolves and are hell-bent on
                       becoming the “alpha” or “top dog” over their owners.
                      Every one of these statements is almost completely backward,
                 and I’ll get to each one of them (and more) in detail in the course
                 of this book. For now, I can say that there are many, many ways to
                 effectively and humanely teach your dog—provided that you start
                 from the basis of positive reinforcement principles rather than
                 outdated and misguided theories of dog behavior.
                      There is a great deal of publicly available misinformation about
                 how to build “balanced” relationships with our dogs based on
                 “submission”—information that is purportedly the key to making
                 our lives and relationships with our dogs better. If we could ask
                 our dogs, I have no doubt they would let us know emphatically
                 that such concepts as forced “balance” and supposedly contented
                 “submission” are a pretty far cry from what they’re actually feel-
                 ing most of the time.
                      And that’s one of the biggest problems in the dog training
                 world today: those who promote what I call dominance, punitive,
                 or compulsion training are realizing that the dog-owning public
                 is figuring out that there must be a better, more effective and
                 humane way to teach their dogs. As a result, these trainers have
                 adapted and borrowed some of the science-based community’s
                 language, repackaged it, and are now selling it as their own mar-
                 keting buzzwords: Positive reinforcement. Reward-based. Gentle. But
                 no matter what they try to call it, traditional dominance and pun-
                 ishment trainers are using methods that are the exact opposite of
                 the misappropriated labels they’re using to sell their services.
                      There is a subset of hybrid trainers who actually do use posi-
                 tive reinforcement when teaching basic learning and language-
                 building exercises but who either remain unconvinced that this

             training method will be effective or lack the confidence and skills
             to harness its power for more serious behavior problems. These
             trainers also employ punishment when dealing with “tougher”
             cases, even though these are the very dogs that would benefit the
             most from positive training and are most likely to regress further
             when punished or forced into so-called submissive states.
                  In truth, anyone can successfully employ positive reinforce-
             ment when teaching basic obedience and dealing with “easy” dogs,
             but it takes advanced knowledge, confidence, and strong leadership
             skills to successfully employ positive training on the most difficult
             behavioral cases. What sets good positive trainers apart from punitive
             trainers is not just their ability to teach a dog to do something using
             force-free methods, but also how they manage to stop unwanted behaviors
             while still using humane training techniques instead of punishment.
                  The landscape of the dog training world is now so confusing
             that owners who want a positive trainer have trouble figuring out
             exactly who fits that description. Compulsion trainers have seen
             their once-impregnable market shares start to shrink as trainers who
             follow modern behavioral science have begun to eat into their prof-
             its. TV shows like It’s Me or the Dog and other media have made the
             public aware that there is indeed a better way to teach—positively.
             I’ve talked to people who told me they just didn’t feel right using
             force and intimidation on their beloved canine companions, but the
             trainers they hired reassured them that they were using positive
             reinforcement. I can’t blame people for falling for this clever mar-
             keting ploy—I’ve worked with dogs for a very long time, and some-
             times even I still can’t tell when someone actually believes what I
             believe or just knows enough buzzwords to squeak by.
                  This confusion and the difficulty people have trying to teach
             their dog humanely or to find a force-free trainer were the inspira-
             tion behind this book and the creation of Victoria Stilwell Posi-
             tively Dog Training (VSPDT)—a global network of world-class

Stil_9781607744146_3p_all_r1.indd 4                                                    1/31/13 1:06 PM
                                            Introduction


                 professional positive reinforcement dog trainers united in their
                 passion for promoting positive training in place of punishment
                 and dominance. All VSPDT trainers have been individually
                 assessed by me and verified to be practitioners of science-based,
                 force-free methods. (For more information on sourcing a trainer,
                 see the Resources section, page 225.)
                      As someone who is often referred to as a torchbearer of
                 humane teaching methodologies, I struggle to understand how
                 anyone can justify teaching a dog through the use of force and
                 fear. While learning to become a dog trainer, I was taught all kinds
                 of techniques that I’ve long since abandoned, and even though I
                 never physically punished a dog, I found that even using aversives
                 such as loud noises to interrupt or curb negative behavior just
                 never felt right. The more I investigated the history and develop-
                 ment of the science of dog behavior, the more certain I became
                 that my instinctual doubts were justified and well-founded.
                      My love for and fascination with dogs has developed into a
                 passion for making sure that people know there is a more effec-
                 tive, humane, rewarding, and enduring way to teach their dogs.
                 This book will respond to many of the arguments you may hear
                 from skeptics of positive training. It is designed to provide posi-
                 tive, humane solutions to some common (and often hard to live
                 with) behaviors. Along the way, I’ll also provide the scientific and
                 anecdotal evidence to support why the scientific community and
                 I can unequivocally state that trying to dominate a dog into what
                 traditional trainers call “submission” through the use of force,
                 punishment, and intimidation is inhumane, damaging, and ulti-
                 mately less effective than science-based positive training.
                      The choice before any dog owner is a simple one: do you want
                 your dog to follow you because she wants to or because she’s scared
                 of what will happen to her if she doesn’t? To me, the answer is
                 obvious.

CONTRIBUCIONES
El perro doméstico
En algunas culturas los perros tuvieron un valor religioso, mientras que en otras su importancia radicaba en la ayuda que les proporcionaban para la cacería y el exterminio de plagas, entre otros; veamos algunos ejemplos de las muchas contribuciones que nos brindan estos excelentes animales: •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 Son excelentes animales de compañía. Los perros lazarillos ayudan a los ciegos. Los perros guardianes protegen las propiedades (y a sus dueños). Los perros de caza ayudan a cazar y/o conseguir alimento. Los perros de trineo se utilizan como medio de transporte. Los perros pastores pastorean el ganado, ovejas y otros animales. Pueden ser utilizados para seguir un rastro de olor, ya sea para atrapar a un criminal o encontrar a una persona desaparecida. •	 Por su agudo olfato, pueden detectar explosivos. •	 Se utilizan para buscar víctimas entre los escombros después de un terremoto. Los perros también han sido utilizados militarmente desde tiempos muy remotos para: •	 •	 •	 •	 •	 Para olfatear las minas terrestres enterradas en los campos. Para transmitir mensajes. Como centinelas. Como exploradores para detectar trampas. Como perros de ataque en la batalla.

Perros Extraordinarios
•	 Perros lazarillos Popularmente se les conoce como 'lazarillos' y algunas veces les vemos ejerciendo su trabajo en el transporte público o ante un paso de peatones. Estos perros adquieren, gracias a un esmerado adiestramiento, el papel de ojos del que no puede ver. En su entrenamiento participan especialistas que no sólo les adiestran para su posterior asignación a una persona ciega, sino que también les trasmiten valores como el cariño, la comprensión y la ternura. Si bien las razas de ovejeros y de defensa pueden emplearse como lazarillos, son los belgas, los ovejeros alemanes, los labradores y los golden retriever aquellos perros mejores calificados para esta tarea; éstos reúnen características como: docilidad, fidelidad e inteligencia. Además, es preferible que sean hembras, dado a que los machos pueden resultar peligrosos si llegan a cruzarse con una perra en celo. Por lo contrario, la hembra es más tranquila y obediente.

EXTRAORDINARIOS
•	 San Bernardo El san bernardo es un perro grande, elegante y fuerte, extrovertido, su apariencia es amigable, pacífica, es un perro “bonachón”. En general manso y afectuoso, es muy leal y devoto a sus amos. Es especialmente adecuado para los niños por quienes siente especial atracción, por lo que recibe el apodo de “perro niñera”. Es lo bastante grande para proteger con mesurada agresividad. El nombre actual lo recibe del hospicio San Bernardo en los Alpes suizos donde desde mediado del siglo XVII fue criado con el propósito de guiar a los monjes en la nieve y rescatar a los viajeros durante las tormentas. Se estima que más de 2,500 personas fueron salvadas por estos perros; a uno de los perros, Barry, se le atribuye haber rescatado cuarenta personas. •	 Perro Pastor Se llama perro pastor a cualquier perro que ayuda al hombre en el manejo de rebaños de ovejas, cabras y otros animales de granja. A los perros pastores que trabajan con ganado bovino se les conoce como perros boyeros. Hay dos tipos de perro pastor, los de guarda que se encargan de proteger los rebaños del ataque de lobos y otros depredadores y los que se encargan de guiar y controlar a los rebaños en sus desplazamientos. A estos últimos también se les llama perros de carea. Hay una gran variedad en su apecto externo, pero todos son animales ágiles, inteligentes, con gran capacidad de aprendizaje y con facilidad para resolver situaciones imprevistas. Ejemplo: Pastor belga, Pastor alemán, Pastor de los Pirineos, Collie, Antiguo perro pastor inglés, Komondor, Pastor blanco suizo. •	 Perro Esquimal El Perro esquimal canadiense es una raza de perro ártica, considerada frecuentemente la más antigua de América del Norte y el más raro pedigrí que se conserva de caninos domésticos de indígenas. Otros nombres incluyen Qimmiq (término Inuktitut para "perro") o el considerado más políticamente correcto Perro Inuit canadiense. Alguna vez fueron el método de transporte preferido de los Inuits, los cuales los ponían a jalar de los trineos.

PREFACE

Mike Davies

At the time of writing this book the study of geriatrics as a veterinary discipline is very much in its infancy. My interest in the subject is obviously becoming more acute as I work through my own midlife crises and see old age looming on the nottoo-distant horizon, but the main stimulus for me to write this book came from Dr J. Mosier (USA), a pioneer of the study of geriatrics in veterinary medicine, and Dr Mary Harrington, a human geriatrician in London - both of whom took part in a Symposium on Geriatric Veterinary Medicine which I organised in London in 1988. In researching for this book I was disappointed at the relative lack of published work on many aspects of geriatrics in veterinary medicine. However I am pleased to say that there is now a considerable amount of work going on - particularly in the areas of progressive renal disease and cognitive disorders. There are inherent dangers in extrapolating too much from experimental studies and from studies conducted in different species, nevertheless there are many useful comparative correlations to be drawn from veterinary species to humans and vice versa. Much work needs to be done to obtain base information about geriatric veterinary patients and in the meantime it would be helpful to the develof veterinary geriatric medicine if the non-sensitive research data from studies in cats and dogs currently held by many pharmaceutical companies and other institutions could be made available. I have tried to draw together relevant information from the published (and unpublished) works of many researchers in various fields and I wish to thank them for documenting their subjects so well. I have tried to make sense out of the information available and to address some of the main issues in geriatric medicine to assist clinicians in first opinion practice. I have avoided in-depth coverage of some topics such as arthritis which perhaps should be in a book on geriatrics, but these are well documented in other publications. At times I have been deliberately controversial and I look forward to receiving correspondence from colleagues with alternative views! I have absolutely no doubt that this book will need to be totally revised within the next few years but in the meantime I hope that it will stimulate some of my colleagues to look further at this interesting group of patients which present such a clinical challenge, and I hope that it may lead to an improvement in the future care and management of geriatric veterinary patients.

1.1 INTRODUCTION
Great advances have been made in human geriatric medicine over the past 20 years. Old people are now regarded as a separate clinical group from the young adult population, and the development of specialisation in 'geriatrics' has increased our knowledge of many of the diseases of the elderly and so improved their treatment and management. Old people are often reluctant to seek medical attention early in the course of a disease, believing that their illness is simply due to 'old age', and that nothing can be done for them. In veterinary practice we face a similar problem because pet owners often do not present an animal when it develops mild signs of disease such as increased thirst or increased frequency of urination in the belief that such signs are an inevitable result of advancing age. Farm animals and some groups of working dogs are not allowed to survive to old age and for these animals there is little available information about the effects of ageing. The oldest recorded age for a horse is 62 years and for a cow 78 years (Matthews 1994). The oldest recorded cat was 34 years, and the oldest dog 29 years, but most dogs live for 8-15 years with large and giant breeds having a shorter life expectancy than small breeds (Matthews 1994). Pet owners (including breeders) sometimes prefer to terminate their animals' lives early rather than allow them to attain their full life expectancy and have to support them through old age. Some owners delay presenting an old animal for treatment because of a genuine fear that the veterinarian might detect a serious illness and advise euthanasia. In fact, most diseases of the aged can be treated and, even if not curable, something can usually be done to improve the quality of life for the animal. If an animal does have a terminal condition, delaying a visit to the veterinary surgeon is not going to help matters, and in the meantime the individual could be subject to unnecessary suffering. One of the most significant advances in human geriatric medicine has been the introduction of routine screening tests. These have brought to the fore a whole spectrum of diseases originally thought to be rare, but now known to be common. Routine screening improves the identification of risk factors and the early detection of disease allowing early intervention and, as a result, patients are living longer, and the mean life-expectancy of the population as a whole is increasing.

Undoubtedly similar advances will be made in veterinary geriatrics, particularly in the area of preventative medicine and the identification and avoidance of risk factors.

1.2 THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF GERIATRIC CATS AND DOGS
In human medicine a large amount of actuarial information has been collected over many years by the insurance companies, and their increasing need to identify risk factors for disease is greatly improving the application of early screening and interpretation of results. The overall effect of these measures is to increase mean longevity by helping people to recognise and avoid risk factors such as obesity, high cholesterol intake, smoking, drugs and alcohol abuse. In 1988 approximately 5% of the human population living in western civilisation were estimated to be over retirement age. In the UK 17% of people were over retirement age and this is anticipated to rise to above 20% by the year 2000 (Harrington 1988). In the USA it was estimated that 17% of dogs and cats were 'geriatric' (i.e. dogs over 10 years, cats over 12 years of age) (Mosier 1988). A 'Market Facts Study' conducted in the USA in 1984 produced the following figures for animals presenting to veterinary surgeries:

Dogs 1 year old or 16% less 2-5 years 41% 6 years or 43% more

Cats 1 year old or 25% less 2-5 years 44% 6 years or 31% more

In the UK a survey of 6417 cats and 20786 dogs presented to the Small Animal Practice Teaching Unit (SAPTU) at Edinburgh University (1991) revealed the following figures for animals presented to them for first and second opinion services:

Dogs Less than 1 year of age 1-6 years 7 years or more

19.4% 45.7% 34.9%

Cats Less than 1 year of age 1-6 years 7 years or more

32.1% 40% 27.9%

Hence a significant number of animals presented to a veterinary surgery are in the 'old age' category. The age distributions of dogs and cats from the SAPTU survey are shown in Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2 respectively.

1.3 DEFINING THE TERM 'GERIATRIC'
Dictionaries define 'geriatric' as 'pertaining to old people' and the World Health Organization (1963) has defined 'middle-age' as being 45-59 years, 'elderly' as being 60-74 years and the 'aged' as over 75 years of age. In human terms the elderly should be regarded by society as a useful resource because of their knowledge, skills and experience but the aged most often need assistance. Unfortunately there is no similar classification for our domesticated species and
Library of veterinary practice 8

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

there is no specific definition of a geriatric animal, though we all recognise external signs of increasing age such as greying of the muzzle, stiffness in movement, changes in posture, reduced responsiveness to outside stimuli, and so on. There are many problems about defining life-stages based on chronological age in cats and dogs because breeds have differing rates of ageing, lead different lifestyles and have different life expectancies. I would therefore like to propose a simplified classification scheme (Table 1.1) based upon functionality rather than chronological age which can be applied at any time to any individual. There are many theories about the ageing process including the concept that all living creatures are genetically programmed to age - a 'biological clock' theory. Most higher living organisms have a relatively brief life consisting of the following basic life stages: conception, growth, reproduction and death. Only a few species (including humans and domesticated pets) pass through a post-reproductive senescent stage known as 'old age'. In the wild, most animals have predators that prevent the frail and infirm from surviving. The ageing process is complex and we have yet to discover its secret. The person who does - and can find a way to delay it - stands to make a fortune! In humans, the mean life-expectancy can be predicted based upon sex, race, socio-economic and other factors. For example, in Western society women live longer than men and smokers have a reduced life expectancy. Factors affecting the life expectancy of cats and dogs have not been fully determined and within breed and across-breed comparisons have not been made though it is generally accepted that large and giant breeds of dog have a shorter life expectancy than small breeds.

Table 1.1 Proposed description for age stages of cats and dogs. Age stage Description 1 (Fetal) Conception to birth - from fertilisation through embryological development to birth Growth - from birth until skeletal growth is completed Young adulthood - active reproductive phase.

1.4 AGEING CHANGES
We can make several observations about ageing changes: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. they are progressive they are irreversible multiple organ systems are involved physiological mechanisms ultimately become impaired variable expression is shown between individuals.

Ageing changes that may occur in tissues include:
• • • • • • •

atrophy fatty infiltration fibrosis delayed ability to repair reduced number of active cells reduced rate of activity reduced organ function.

The pigment lipofuscin is deposited in body tissues in increasing amounts with increasing age, indeed it has been called 'the pigment of ageing'. In the dog lipofuscin is deposited at five times the rate that it is in humans. Ageing changes proceed at varying rates in different organ systems of the body, and may be present in varying degrees of severity between individuals of the same age. Typically, older animals lose sensitivity of their major senses, e.g. vision, hearing, taste and smell, and all organ systems may be affected to some degree by age-related changes. Geriatric screening is helpful in determining whether or not organ function is

impaired, particularly before elective procedures such as minor surgery. Some organ systems are more likely to be affected than others, for example with increasing age teeth are likely to demonstrate:
• • • • • • •

dental calculus accumulation gingival hyperplasia periodontitis gum atrophy and retraction enamel wear ulcerative lesions tooth loss.

By the time they are 7-8 years of age 95% of dogs are said to be affected by periodontal disease (Harvey 1988). The occurrence of obesity increases with age probably due to: 1. reduced lean body mass (hence reduced basal energy requirement (BER)) 2. reduced exercise 3. overnutrition.

Obesity can have serious effects on other body systems, e.g. cardiovascular and skeletal systems, and may have a role in the cause of some diseases, e.g. diabetes mellitus. Some age-related changes that may be seen in various organ systems are listed below (after Mosier and others):

Gastrointestinal tract
• • • • • •

reduced salivary secretion impaired oesophageal function (neuronal) reduced HCI secretion slower rate of renewal of epithelium reduced villous size impaired nutrient absorption.

Liver
• •

decreased number of hepatocytes increased binucleated hepatocytes

fatty infiltration increased fibrous tissue decreased hepatic function decreased bile formation.

Kidney
• • • • • •

reduced renal size reduced number of nephrons reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduced renal plasma flow reduced tubular excretion reduced tubular reabsorption.

Eye
• • • • • • • • • • •

iris atrophy nuclear sclerosis cataracts loss of rods and cones cystoid retinal degeneration asteroid hyalosis eyelid papillomas cysts of the gland of Moll increased tear viscosity decreased lysozyme activity, increased susceptibility to infection corneal pigment changes due chronic irritation.

Skin
• • • • • • • •

hair becomes sparse, dull and lustreless patchy alopecia white hairs (loss of pigment) calluses over pressure points skin thickens, reduced pliability hyperkeratosis; later, epidermis atrophies calcium/pseudoelastin replace elastic fibres hyperplasia of apocrine and sebaceous glands.

Endocrine system
• • • • • • •

fatty infiltration, cyst formation and fibrosis reduced hormone production, e.g. thyroid and sex hormones reduced response to T3 and T4 reduced T4 binding capacity of serum proteins chronic thyroiditis (15-20% aged beagles) reduced response to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) mammary nodules/tumours in 80% intact bitches at 11 years age.

Skeletal system
• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •

loss of muscle mass reduced number and size of muscle cells fibrosis, atrophy and reduced response to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) impaired resynthesis of ATP impaired ability to use amino acids as an energy source reduced oxygen transport reduced neuromuscular functidn long bone cortices thin, change in density and become brittle reduced number and activity of osteoblasts reduced amount of cartilage which splits and fragments reduced mucopolysaccharide production reduced chondroitin sulphate production spondylosis and costochondral calcification degenerative joint disease synovial fluid thickens with increased globulin content increased rheumatoid and antinuclear factors.

Central nervous system
• • • • • • •

neurotransmitter changes; acetylcholinesterase levels increase, choline acetyltransferase decreases monoamine oxidase levels increase, causing decreased neurotransmitter levels; reduced serotonin increases sleep, and causes neuromuscular disorders and depression; stimulation of interneurones in the brain is longer lasting, leading to shortterm memory loss, impaired learning and delayed response time; hypoxia due to reduced respiratory function and cardiovascular changes, e.g. arteriocapillary fibrosis; senile behaviour changes, e.g. loss of house training.
Library of veterinary practice 13

Peripheral nervous system
• • •

loss of reflexes; cell loss and lipofuscin accumulation in ganglia of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems cause impaired gut motility (constipation); reduced reaction to stimuli and partial loss of senses (taste, vision, hearing and smell).

Respiratory system
• • • • • • • • •

obstructive lung disease reduced ciliary activity decreased secretions with increased viscosity bronchial constriction due to decreased adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pulmonary fibrosis decreased alveolar diffusing capacity depressed cough reflex chronic bronchitis hypoxaemia.

Immune system
• • •

involution of lymph nodes, Peyer's patches and tonsils reduced size of cortices in lymph nodes reduced immunocompetence despite normal numbers of immunocytes.

Haematology
• • • • •

bone marrow becomes pale and fatty splenomegaly with hyperplasia, haemosiderosis and haematomas decreased red blood cell count and haemoglobin carrying capacity relative anaemia (common) replenishment of red cells may take longer (2 x).

These types of age-related changes may impair normal physiological activities, reduce the ability of the animal to respond to stresses, infections or other attacks on the body, and delay healing processes. Nevertheless advanced age is not regarded as being a disease state.

Because of reduced hepatic function, renal function and suboptimal metabolic processes older animals may have an impaired ability to metabolise and excrete drugs. Hence medications may need to be given at different dose rates from the normal adult dose. There may also be addirisks associated with general anaesthesia or elective surgery.

1.5 GERIATRIC DISEASES
Geriatric disease can be classified (Harrington 1988) as: 1. diseases proper to old age 2. diseases that persist into old age 3. diseases with a changing incidence in old age.

In many cases of frank clinical disease in older animals there will be concurrent problems affecting other body systems (Mosier 1988). No two clinical cases in geriatric animals are exactly the same (Mosier 1988). Many of the diseases that appear in old age are chronic and insidious, often being present for many months or even years before the owner notices signs. Subclinical disease may present serious difficulties in managing a case. Advancing age is, in itself, a risk factor for the development of certain diseases, e.g. neoplasia, acute renal failure, endocardiosis. The objectives of management of a geriatric animal are: 1. 2. 3. 4. prevent or delay the onset of disease identify and ameliorate existing problems as early as possible maintain body weight and condition maintain quality of life.

Prolongation of life is not, in itself, a valid clinical objective if the animal will suffer as a result of intervention and its quality of life is poor.

THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

KEY POINTS
(1) Cardiovascular disease is very common in old dogs. (2) Heart disease is often subclinical and the onset of heart failure insidious. (3) The incidence and severity of chronic valvular lesions increase with advancing age in dogs. (4) Concurrent disease in other organ systems is common. (5) Except for Stage IV emergency cases, a full physical examination is necessary to confirm the presence of concomitant disease before specific therapy is started. (6) Minimise the exposure of geriatric animals to cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and high dietary salt intake. 2.1 REDUCED CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION 2.2 AGE-RELATED TISSUE CHANGES 2.3 DIAGNOSTIC AIDS 2.4 GERIATRIC CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE 2.5 TREATMENT OF GERIATRIC HEART DISEASE REFERENCES AND FURTHER READING

2.1 REDUCED CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION
The cardiovascular system is the most important organ system in the body because maintenance of blood flow to and from cells is essential for the normal function and survival of all body tissues. When cardiovascular function is impaired it has deleterious effects on many organ systems, including the cardiovascular system itself.

Reduced tissue perfusion
Reduced tissue perfusion may result in: (1) hypoxia (2) poor cell nutrition (3) reduced supply of immune mediators (4) failure to remove metabolic waste products and toxins (5) failure to transport physiologically active substances.

Compensatory mechanisms
In the presence of reduced cardiac function compensatory mechanisms come into operation which attempt to maintain blood flow to vital organs such as the brain and heart, and in the process blood may be diverted away from other tissues such as the abdominal viscera. These haemodynamic changes are helpful in hypovolaemia or shock and may have no serious consequences in the short-term for healthy individuals, but they can be deleterious when maintained over a long period of time, particularly in elderly animals in which tissues may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of reduced or increased perfusion. Many ageing dogs have cardiovascular lesions but they are in a stable, compensated state with perhaps an audible murmur but no signs of heart failure. Veterinary cardiologists traditionally do not recommend therapeutic intervention until the animal is decompensated and clinical signs of failure are present, but it is important to realise that the compensatory mechanisms themselves may have adverse effects on the body. Prolonged sympathetic stimulation, for example, may induce insulin resistance and reduce glucose tolerance, with important metabolic consequences for the individual.

Cardiac workload
One objective in the management of geriatric animals with clinical or subheart disease should be to reduce unnecessary workload on the heart. The sum of the forces acting upon the myocardium to stretch the muscle fibres at the end of diastole is called the preload, and the sum of the forces opposing myocardial contraction during systole is called the after-load. Restriction of dietary salt intake is one simple mechanism by which preload can be decreased, and avoidance or reduction of obesity can also significantly reduce cardiac workload. In the presence of clinical disease therapeutic agents such as diuretics can be used to reduce preload and vasodilators to modify preload and afterload.

Secondary heart disease
Control of cardiac activity depends upon the normal function and co-ordination of several organ systems including the peripheral nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic), endocrine function (e.g. adrenal and thyroid),the cardiovascular system itself and the metabolic state of the animal (e.g. electrolyte balance, acidbase balance). Various chemical agents, toxins, nutritional abnormalities (deficiencies, excesses or imbalances), systemic diseases or metabolic diseases partithose of the liver, kidneys, lungs or endocrine system may interfere with cardiovascular function causing secondary heart disease.

Concomitant disease
In geriatric patients presenting with cardiac disease it is important to consider the likelihood of concomitant disorders in other organ systems:

(1) (2) (3) (4)

as a primary cause of the heart disease, e.g. hyperthyroidism; secondary to the heart disease, e.g. reduced renal function; reducing the efficacy of therapeutic agents, e.g. reduced efficacy of diuretics in the presence of hypoproteinaemia associated with reduced liver function; enhancing the toxicity of therapeutic agents, e.g. digoxin toxicity in the presence of renal failure or hypokalaemia.

2.2 AGE-RELATED TISSUE CHANGES
Structural Changes Metabolic Changes Cardiac performance with increasing age

Mike Davies

Structural changes
Structural changes found with increasing age which may or may not be associated with clinical signs of disease include:

Heart
• • • • • • • • • •

valvular thickening (fibrosis) myocardial fibrosis myocardial necrosis microscopic coronary arteriosclerosis microscopic intramural myocardial infarction (MIMIs) myocardial hypertrophy * fatty infiltration chamber dilatation* lipofuscin accumulation in myocyte cytoplasm Myocardial amyloid deposition.

* Compensatory changes

Lipofuscin accumulation in myocyte cytoplasm increases with age in the dog, and starts at about 7 years of age. It is not known whether it has any adverse effect on myocyte function. Cardiac amyloidosis is a frequent finding at post-mortem examination in geriatric humans (50% of people over 65 years, and 84% of people over 90 years), but in one study of dogs only 0.6% (all over 10 years of age) had this change at routine autopsy. In one report valvular endocardiosis lesions increased in incidence and severity

with increasing age, and were present in all dogs over 13 years of age (Whitney 1974).

Blood vessels
• • • • • • • • • •

arteriosclerosis fibrous thickening of the intima or media of the aorta hyaline or amyloid thickening of the media of blood vessels calcification of the aortic intima calcification of the media in peripheral vessels muscular hypertrophy of small and medium-sized arterioles arteriocapillary fibrosis increased capillary fragility increased capillary permeability atherosclerosis - rare compared with man.

Arteriosclerosis of intramural coronary arteries has been reported to occur in 77.6% of geriatric dogs over 12 years of age (Valtonen 1972), 60% of dogs over 14 years of age (Detweiler et al. 1968) and 50% of dogs aged 13 years or older (Jonsson 1972). A direct association was found between the presence of arteriosclerosis and microscopic intramural myocardial infarcts (MIMIs). These structural changes cause a loss of elasticity of vascular walls and / or luminal narrowing, and contribute to increased peripheral resistance which, combined with reduced sensitivity to the vasodilator effect of β -adrenergic stimulation (see below), probably contributes to the increased aortic impedance and left ventricular afterload seen in geriatric patients. Vessels supplying various organs throughout the body may be affected, notably the kidney and brain, resulting in impaired vascular supply, and ultimately impaired organ function. Atherosclerosis leading to myocardial infarction while common in humans is rare in dogs and cats. Obesity and thyroid atrophy or frank hypothyroidism are associated with the development of atherosclerosis in geriatric dogs. Experimentally, atherosclerosis can only be caused in hypothyroid dogs on high fat diets. Miniature schnauzers with hyperlipidaemia may be predisposed to develop atherosclerosis.

Metabolic changes

Mike Davies

Metabolic changes reported to occur in the cardiovascular system with increasing age include changes in myocardial enzymes:

(1) monoamine oxidase and malic deshydrogenase activity increase (2) dopamine β-oxidase, dopa decarboxylase, lactic dehydrogenase, cytochrome oxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity decrease.

Cardiac performance with increasing age
Changes in cardiac performance with increasing age have been reported in dogs. Older (8-12 years old) beagles were found to have a reduced maximum heart rate in response to isoproterenol administration than younger (1-4 years old) beagles (Yin et al. 1979). Also, increased impedance to left ventricular ejection has been demonstrated at exercise in 10-14-year-old beagles compared with younger individuals (Yin et al. 1981) demonstrating that ventricular afterload increases in older dogs. These changes are thought to be caused by reduced cardiovascular response to β adrenergic stimulation due to uncoupling of an intracellular pathway possibly related to cyclic AMP or protein kinase phosphorylation. Receptor sensitivity is reduced in the presence of catecholamines, and increased catecholamine concentrations have been reported in old people, who develop similar reductions in function. Chronically increased catecholamine concentrations also occur as one of the physiological mechanisms in cardiac compensation, such as in response to reduced cardiac output in endocardiosis. Reduced response to β-adrenergic stimulation in the peripheral vasculature decreases vasodilation which was demonstrated in the study of beagles at exercise (Yin et al. 1981) as the lower impedance in the young dogs was eliminated by administration of beta-blocker. Myocyte contraction and relaxation times are prolonged with increasing age, a phenomenon thought to be due to reduced uptake of calcium ions by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in increased contact time between the calcium and actin and myosin filaments. In rats reduced concentrations of the enzyme

Mike Davies

calcium adenosinetriphosphatase have been reported, which might explain such an effect. There is one report that cardiac output in dogs decreases by 30% from the middle to last one-third of a dog's lifespan (Mosier 1987). However, there are conflicting reports from human studies about this effect of ageing and currently it is thought that cardiac output is probably maintained at rest, but left ventricular ejection fraction is reduced in elderly human patients during exercise. In other words the cardiovascular system of geriatric patients has difficulty in adapting to increased workloads, reinforcing the need to minimise exposure to excessive workload.

2.3 DIAGNOSTIC AIDS
Accurate diagnosis depends on careful consideration of the history and physical examination. In geriatric patients the minimum database should also include some basic clinical tests including packed cell volume, total protein, urinalysis, survey chest radiography, electrocardiogram (ECG) and sometimes echocardiography.

Radiography Echocardiography Electrocardiography Laboratory screening

Radiography
Left atrial enlargement can be seen on a dorsoventral view as a bulge at the 2-3 o'clock position, and on the lateral view there is separation of the mainstem bronchi with the left bronchus being forced dorsally. Left ventricular enlargement is recognised on a lateral view by straightening of the caudal border of the heart, sometimes becoming convex, and loss of the caudal cardiac 'waist'. The trachea is elevated dorsally and the presence of pulmonary
Library of veterinary practice 24

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

venous congestion is recognised by enlargement of pulmonary veins, and the presence of pulmonary oedema (interstitial and/or alveolar), particularly in the perihilar region of the lung field. Right atrial enlargement is recognised on the lateral view by cranial bulging of the cardiac silhouette, and on the dorsoventral view by bulging at the 10 o'clock position. The trachea is elevated over the cranial part of the heart on the lateral view. On a lateral view right ventricular enlargement causes increased sternal contact and increased convexity of the cranial border of the cardiac silThe apex of the heart is sometimes lifted off the sternum. The trachea is elevated over the cranial heart. Right-sided heart failure results in passive venous congestion of abclominal structures and radiographic evidence of hepatomegaly, spleand ascites are often present as well as enlargement of the caudal vena cava. If there is underperfusion of the lung, pulmonary arteries and veins may appear thin and the lung parenchyma radiolucent. A large rounded cardiac silhouette is indicative of pericardial effusion (though in younger animals peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernias or per cardial cysts may give a similar radiographic appearance). Positive contrast studies using an image intensifier may be useful to demonstrate valvular regurgitation during systole.

Echocardiography
M-mode echocardiography is a superior imaging method to radiography because abnormal morphology of the valves can be visualised, and chamber dimensions and contractility can be measured. Doppler, in particular colour flow Doppler, is extremely useful in detecting blood flow abnormalities associated with valvular regurgitation.

Electrocardiography

Mike Davies

An ECG is essential if an arrhythmia is detected on auscultation but may not be particularly helpful in some cases, e.g. chronic valvular endocardiosis. Left atrial enlargement may cause a prolonged P wave (greater than 0.04s in both the dog and cat) called P mitrale. Prolonged P waves may be biphasic. Right atrial enlargement (seen with tricuspid insufficiency) may cause an increased P wave voltage (greater than 0.4 mV in the dog, greater than 0.2 mV in the cat) called P pulmonale. Both P pulmonale and P mitrale may be present at the same time. Left ventricular enlargement may result in tall R waves, and prolonged QRS complexes. Slurring of the ST segment may be seen. Right ventricular enlargement may result in right axis deviation and deep S waves (greater than 0.35 mV in lead II), and positive T waves in lead V10. Notching of the QRS complex (R wave) is often seen in geriatric dogs and is thought to be caused by the presence of MIMIs.

Laboratory screening
In the author's opinion routine laboratory screening of geriatric dogs with heart disease is mandatory, particularly before the administration of drugs which might be hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic such as the cardiac glycosides. Chronic diuretic use may induce hypokalaemia, indeed hypokalaemia is probably common but rarely detected because it is not routinely screened for. Elevated liver enzymes are likely to be detected if hepatic congestion is present, and prerenal azotaemia is common in the presence of reduced cardiac output.

2.4 GERIATRIC CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE

Mike Davies

Some cats and dogs with congenital heart disorders may survive into old age, as will many animals that develop clinical signs of heart disease in middle-age. Successful management of these cases through old age requires an understanding of the physical, metabolic and systemic changes that the individuals are undergoing due to normal ageing changes and concurrent organ disease. Destabilisation may occur, and readjustrnent of drug doses may be needed in some individuals, particularly those that develop signs of decompensation or drug toxicity. Clinical conditions that would normally be expected to occur earlier in life may appear for the first time in old age, but in this section we shall only consider those cardiovascular diseases which are normally expected to occur in geriatric patients.

1. Acquired chronic valvular disease (endocardiosis) 2. Bacterial endocarditis 3. Dilated cardiomyopathy 4. Neoplasia 5. Feline hyperthyroidism 6. Cor pulmonale

1. Acquired chronic valvular disease (endocardiosis) Incidence
Acquired atrioventricular valvular endocardiosis is the most common canine heart condition accounting for over 70% of cases, with a reported overall incidence of 1740%. The disease is most prevalent in small to medium size dogs in the last third of their life, males are more often affected than females (1.5: 1) and it increases both in frequency and severity with increasing age. One study reported severe disease to be present in 58% of dogs over 9 years of age, and endocardiosis lesions were present in all dogs over 13 years of age (Whitney 1974). The author concluded that the frequency of occurrence and the
Library of veterinary practice 27

severity of the valvular lesions increased with increasing age (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2). Table 2.1 Frequency of AV lesions in 200 canine hearts (Whitney 1974)

Endocardiosis is rarely reported in cats.

Aetiopathogenesis
The cause of the valvular lesions seen in endocardiosis is unknown, but natural ageing processes have been suggested by some authors, either: (1) associated with ageing changes in the collagen fibres of the valves, or (2) valve injury progressing to a degenerative lesion.

It is commonly believed that chronic valvular disease begins in the first third of life, progresses to cause valvular incompetence in the second third of life, and may be associated with congestive heart failure in the last third of life, though most dogs are likely to develop cardiac compensation and not progress to exhibit clinical signs of failure.

Gross lesions
Greyish-white nodules or plaques on the valves, with weakening and thickening of the chordae tendinae. Jet lesions on the atrium.
Library of veterinary practice 28

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

Lesions most often involve the left atrioventricular valve (mitral) and less commonly the right atrioventricular (tricuspid) valve (see Plate 1). The aortic and pulmonary valves are rarely affected.

Histopathology
Various changes have been described including: (1) (2) (3) (4) myxomatous changes deposition of hyaline (fibrinoid) material fibrous and elastic proliferation mucoid degeneration.

There is proliferation of the spongiosa layer of the valve with increased amounts of matrix containing glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).

Pathophysiology
The valvular lesions result in: (1) inadequate closure of the valves during systole with regurgitation of blood into the atrium (2) volume overload of atrium and ventricule (3) compensatory atrial and ventricular dilatation (4) myocardial hypertrophy (5) myocardial failure (eventually) (6) pulmonary oedema (due to pulmonary vein compression) (7) left mainstem bronchus compression (causes a cough) (8) bronchoconstriction (if pulmonary oedema present) (9) dysrhythmias (due to stretching of chamber wall) (10) rupture of the atrium with haemopericardium (rare) (11) rupture of the chordae tendinae.

Endocardiosis results in 'backward' failure or left-sided heart failure initially.

History

Mike Davies

Exercise intolerance and coughing are the most frequent owner comOften there is a history of weight loss (even if the dog is still overweight).

Clinical findings
(1) systolic murmur present on auscultation, and localisable to the site of the mitral and/or tricuspid valve (2) a precordial thrill may be palpable (3) sinus tachycardia sometimes with dysrhythmias (4) pulse deficit (sometimes).

Treatment
Preload reducers, e.g. salt restriction, diuretics and vasodilators. Cardiac inotropes, e.g. cardiac glycosides.

2. Bacterial endocarditis Incidence
Most commonly affects older, male, large breed dogs, and German shepherd dogs may be predisposed to develop the condition. It is rare in the cat.

Gross pathology
Large cauliflower-like vegetative masses develop attached to the endothelium of the valve leaflets. The mitral valve is most commonly affected, followed by the aortic valve. The tricuspid valve is only occasionally involved. When bacterial endocarditis does occur in the cat is usually affects the mitral valve.

Histopathology
The lesions consist of bacteria, with inflammatory cells (mononuclear cells and neutrophils) and platelets in an amorphous mass of fibrin and necrotic tissues.

Library of veterinary practice

30

Canine and Feline Geriatrics
Aetiopathogenesis

Mike Davies

Usually secondary to a bacteraemia. Bacteria most frequently cultured from the lesions are coagulase positive staphylococci (particularly Staoureus), Escherichia coli and 13-haemolytic streptococci. Periodontal infection is very common in older dogs and cats, and may act as a primary site for the development of a bacteraemia. Emboli from the heart valves may travel to any organ, e.g. the kidney, spleen and myocardium, causing abscesses or infarction.

Pathophysiology
The lesions cause valvular regurgitation or incompetence, leading to leftheart failure.

Clinical findings
The most common clinical findings in decreasing order of occurrence are: (1) fever (2) tachycardia (3) vomiting (4) lameness (5) cardiac murmur (6) ventricular arrhythmia (7) renal failure (8) heart failure (9) sudden death (10) myopathy.

Laboratory findings
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) positive blood culture - not always detected leukocytosis with left shift monocytosis low serum albumin increased serum alkaline phosphatase (occasional finding) hypoglycaemia (occasional finding) normocytic normochromic anaemia increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Diagnosis

Mike Davies

Is based on history and clinical signs, laboratory findings, the presence of a murmur and positive blood culture. Echocardiographic examination is also very helpful.

Treatment
Prolonged high dose bactericidal antibiotics (ideally based on culture and sensitivity results) which penetrate fibrin. Several antibiotics are usually given alternatively over a 6-8-week period. S. aureus are usually: &Nbsp; Sensitive to &Nbsp; Cephalosporins &Nbsp; Aminoglycosides &Nbsp; Erythromycin &Nbsp; Chioramphenicol

Resistant to Penicillin Ampicillin Trimethoprim

E. Coli are usually: &Nbsp; Sensitive to &Nbsp; Gentamicin &Nbsp; Cephalosporins β-Haemolytic streptococci are usually: &Nbsp; Sensitive to &Nbsp; Penicillin &Nbsp; Ampicillin &Nbsp; Cephalosporins &Nbsp; Chloramphenicol

Resistant to Ampicillin Chloramphenicol

Resistant to Erythromycin Aminoglycosides Trimethoprim

Higher than normal dose rates of antibiotics are recommended in bacterial endocarditis, and the intravenous route is preferred initially. It is important to treat concomitant problems, and care needs to be taken in geriatric patients when using drugs such as the aminoglycosides which may be nephrotoxic.

3. Dilated cardiomyopathy Incidence

Mike Davies

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) usually occurs in young to middle age dogs (range 6 months to 14 years, mean 4-6 years) of giant breeds, however in the boxer the mean age at presentation is reported to be 8 years (Fox 1988) and so the condition is included in this chapter. In boxers more males are affected than females and there is greater prevalence in some breeding lines. DCM affects mainly young to middle aged cats, and is often associated with taurine deficiency. Taurine deficiency has been identified as a cause of DCM in cats fed commercial petfoods that failed to maintain satisfacplasma taurine concentrations. It is not considered further here.

Gross pathology
Severe dilatation of all chambers of the heart is characteristic of the condition in most breeds, but this is not true in the boxer. There is thinning of the ventricular walls (unless compensatory hypertrophy is present) and atrophy of papillary muscles and trabeculae. Focal endocardial fibrosis is present. In boxers there is usually thickening of the atrioventricular valves (mitral, but sometimes the tricuspid or aortic valve).

Histopathology
Myocardial degeneration.

Aetiopathogenesis
The aetiology is unknown in most cases. Metabolic defects have been demonstrated in some species and carnitine-related problems in the myocardium have been reported in some dogs, including boxers with DCM. Selenium deficiency has been implicated but not proven in some cases as have toxins, infective agents (viruses) and immunological factors.

Pathophysiology
Impaired ventricular contractility leads to reduced ejection volume, though compensatory mechanisms such as increased heart rate may maintain cardiac output for a short period. Reduced renal blood flow stimulates the reninangiotensin-aldosterone-antidiuretic hormone (ADH) pathway causing sodium and water retention increasing preload and afterload. Increased sympathetic tone also increases preload, and results in peripheral vasoconstruction further reducing
Library of veterinary practice 33

Canine and Feline Geriatrics
cardiac output. Congestive heart failure eventually develops.

Mike Davies

Clinical findings
(1) weakness (2) congestive heart failure (3) syncope (4) pale membranes, prolonged capillary refill times (5) ascites, hepatosplenomaegaly (6) mitral murmur (7) weight loss (8) arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation often - but not in boxers) (9) cardiomegaly on radiographs (10) ECG changes. About one-half of the boxers with DCM have no significant radiographic abnormalities present, and about one-third of boxers are asymptomatic. ECG changes most typical for the boxer are ventricular premature complexes and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. Endomyocardial biopsy has confirmed carnitine-deficiency in some boxers with DCM, and dietary supplementation may be beneficial.

Treatment
• • • • • •

inotropic agents diuretics vasodilators antiarrhythmic drugs dietary modification restricted exercise.

4. Neoplasia
In dogs haemangiosarcoma is the most common primary cardiac neoplasm and it usually affects the right atrium. They may also be secondary having spread from another site. The German shepherd dog may be predisposed to develop this type of tumour. Heart base tumours (chemodectomas) are most commonly found in brachycephalic dogs such as the boxer and Boston terrier (6-14 years of age) and males may be affected more frequently. The tumours usually involve the aortic bodies lying at the base of the aorta and pulmonary artery. They are often small and slow growing, but can infiltrate locally. Ectopic thyroid or parathyroid tumours
Library of veterinary practice 34

Canine and Feline Geriatrics
and lymphomas may also occur at this site.

Mike Davies

In cats primary cardiac tumours are rare. Haemangiosarcoma and lymphosarcoma are the most common secondary metastatic neoplasms.

Clinical findings
Depending upon the structures invaded or compressed by the growing tumour mass a variety of clinical findings can be seen: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) dysrhythmias signs of congestive heart failure pericardial effusion (haemorrhage) with/without tamponade syncope weakness weight loss dyspnoea.

Diagnosis
Based on clinical findings, radiography, echocardiography.

Treatment
Although surgical excision may be possible in some cases, treatment is usually inadvisable as the prognosis is poor.

5. Feline hyperthyroidism Incidence
Hyperthyroidism, or thyrotoxicosis is a common condition of older cats (6-20 years) with a reported incidence of 1/300 cats. There is no breed or sex predilection.

Gross pathology
Cats with hyperthyroidism are usually thin or emaciated. They have unior bilateral enlargement of the thyroid glands.

Library of veterinary practice

35

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

Histopathology
Benign functional adenoma (adenomatous hyperplasia) of the thyroid gland. Thyroid carcinomas rarely cause hyperthyroidism in the cat.

Aetiopathogenesis
Unknown.

Pathophysiology
Cardiac changes in hyperthyroidism are due to the direct effects of increased thyroid hormone secretion on the heart, and increased adrestimulation. These changes include increased heart rate, conejection fraction (at rest but not during exercise), pulse pressure and cardiac output. Secondary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may occur, or the condition may progress to congestive heart failure.

Clinical findings
The following are most frequently noted: (1) weight loss (2) polyphagia (3) hyperactivity (4) tachycardia (5) polydipsia/polyuria (6) cardiac murmur (7) vomiting (8) diarrhoea. Enlargement of the thyroid gland(s) can usually be palpated and may be unilateral or bilateral. A chain of thyroid masses may extend down the neck and through the thoracic inlet. On ECG sinus tachycardia and large R waves are seen in lead II (>0.9mV). Arrhythmias are also often present. Chest radiographs reveal left-sided cardiac enlargement with other signs of congestive heart failure, e.g. pulmonary oedema and/or pleural effusion. Echocardiography demonstrates left ventricular dilatation, hyperand increased contractility. These changes are reversible once the hyperthyroidism is corrected.

Mike Davies

Radionuclide imaging is helpful to confirm whether both lobes of the thyroid are involved, to identify small adenomatous changes, to detect intrathoracic remnants and to identify metastases.

Laboratory findings
Elevated T4 concentrations and usually elevated T3 as well. These cases also may have elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations. Hyperphosphataemia sometimes occurs. Leukocytosis, eosinopenia and increased packed cell volume are commonly found.

Diagnosis
Clinical findings, elevated T4 concentrations, palpation of enlarged thyroid lobe(s).

Treatment
Primary objective is to create a euthyroid state: (1) thyroidectomy - treatment of choice (2) antithyroid drugs - carbimazole 10-15 mg daily in divided doses for 1-3 weeks (3) radioactive iodine therapy.

Specific treatment for the secondary cardiac disease should only be given if needed: (1) diuretics (frusemide 1 mg/kg, b.i.d. to t.i.d.) if oedema or pleural effusion is severe (2) oral propranolol if tachydysrhythmias are severe at a dose of 2.5 mg b.i.d. to t.i.d. up to 6kg body weight (for cats over 6kg body weight give Smg b.i.d. to t.i.d.).

6. Cor pulmonale
Cor pulmonale is right heart disease secondary to pulmonary vascular or parenchymal disease. It is common in brachycephalic dogs with chronic airway obstruction due to stenosis of the nares, or collapse of the trachea or bronchi, or chronic bronchitis.

Aetiopathogenesis
Several causes have been described:

(1) Primary lung disease. In geriatric dogs the most common cause is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (which includes bronchitis and emphysema). (2) Pulmonary vascular obstruction due to heartworm, thromboembolism, or compression by neoplastic or other masses. (3) Obesity restricting chest wall movement resulting in poor inspiration and hypoxaemia (Pickwickian-syndrome). (4) Thoracic deformity such as pectus excavatum.

Pathophysiology
Pulmonary arterial hypertension leads to right-sided cardiac enlargement, with myocardial hypertrophy progressing to right ventricular failure.

Clinical findings
Onset may be acute or chronic. Severe cases may present with air hunger and abdominal breathing, cyanosis or sudden death; milder cases with anorexia, weakness, depression, wheezing, dyspnoea, panting, coughing, signs of rightsided congestive heart failure. It is a diagnostic challenge to differentiate between a chronic cough caused by atrial compression or a mainstem bronchus, and a cough caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly in geriatric patients as both conditions frequently occur together. Nevertheless correct diagis essential if treatment is to prove successful. Auscultation may reveal abnormal lung sounds depending upon the amount of fluid secretion. Heart sounds may be normal, or there may be a split second sound, and sometimes there is a murmur caused by tricuspid insufficiency.

2.5 TREATMENT OF GERIATRIC HEART DISEASE

Mike Davies

Rational treatment of cardiovascular disease depends upon accurate diagnosis of the type of heart disease present. Most forms of heart disease are progressive and treatment is aimed at controlling the signs of failure and delaying progression, it does not change the underlying pathology. Left-sided heart failure Right-sided heart failure Myocardial failure Staging heart failure DIET DRUGS

Left-sided heart failure
Left-sided heart failure causes increased pulmonary venous pressure and pulmonary oedema. The animal presents with pulmonary signs due to congestion, i.e. coughing, increased respiratory noise on auscultation, dyspnoea, orthopnoea, cyanosis. Excitation or exertion usually exacerbate the signs. Left-sided heart failure is common in geriatric patients being caused by chronic valvular endocardiosis and cardiomyopathies which are both common, and myocarditis which is rare.

Right-sided heart failure
Results in congestion of abdominal organs causing hepatomegaly, splenomegally distended caudal vena cava and jugular veins, pericardial effusions and ascites or intrathoracic effusions. Peripheral oedema rarely occurs.

Mike Davies

Tricuspid insufficiency, cor pulmonale and neoplasia of the right side of the heart are the geriatric diseases which would most likely cause right heart failure in the UK, but the pulmonary hypertension that occurs with left-sided heart failure may result eventually in right-sided failure as well. In enzootic areas heartworm can also cause right heart failure at any age.

Myocardial failure
Is characterised by the presence of a weak pulse, pallor, cold extremeties, with exercise intolerance and sometimes the development of prerenal azotaemia.

Staging heart failure
Four clinical stages of progressive heart failure have been defined by the New York Heart Association and these are useful when determining the most appropriate treatment regimen for individual cases (Table 2.3). Contrary to the conventional view of veterinary cardiologists, the author believes that sodium restriction and obesity control should be started as early as possible in the course of heart disease, i.e. during stage I.

DIET
Energy Salt Intake Other minerals Protein Dietary recommendations

Mike Davies

Energy
At the time of presentation many animals with heart disease will exhibit cardiac cachexia and several mechanisms for this have been proposed: (1) Anorexia - due to the disease itself but also commonly associated with some therapeutic agents (2) Malabsorption - due to compromised gastrointestinal function. (3) Peripheral tissue deterioration due to underperfusion. (4) Hypermetabolism of respiratory and cardiac tissues. (5) Generalised hypermetabolism due to fever, sepsis or stress. The chronic sympathetic stimulation which is a normal compensatory mechanism in response to falling cardiac output will induce a catabolic state in the patient and may lead to peripheral insulin resistance. Cardiac patients have high energy requirements and need an increased energy intake. Fat provides 2.25 times as much energy per gram as either protein or carbohydrate, hence a high-fat diet is indicated. A high fat diet is also beneficial because the amount of food that an animal with heart disease needs to consume to meet its requirements is reduced, and fat in a ration increases its palatability. Clinical diseases associated with excessive fat consumption that are common in man (e.g. severe coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis) are fortunately rare in old cats and dogs. For debilitated cases special feeding techniques may need to be employed including force feeding or tube feeding.

Salt intake
Dogs with subclinical as well as clinical heart disease have impaired sodium regulation (Hamlin et al. 1967). Dogs with progressive valvular endomay have sodium retention during the prodromal (or compensated) phase of the disease. This is a reasonable conclusion because one of the body's compensatory mechanisms in the presence of reducing cardiac output is sodium and water retention by activation of the renin-angiapathway and aldosterone concentrations have been found to be increased in dogs with spontaneous heart failure.
Library of veterinary practice 42

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

Sodium retention increases preload on the heart and may lead to hypertension, oedema and ascites. Plasma sodium concentrations may also be affected by two situations commonly found in geriatrics: (1) Reduced daily water intake - the thirst centre is reported to be less sensitive to hyperosmolarity in older animals. (2) Renal insufficiency - leads to sodium retention. Contrary to popular belief, there is no documented evidence that dogs resist change from a high salt to a low salt diet. In one practice survey, only one client in ten reported any difficulty in getting their dog to accept a very low salt diet, and that was not due to poor palatability (Sauvage J. 1990, personal communication). If changing from a high salt diet to a low salt diet is going to be a proit is likely to be so in: (1) older dogs with an acquired taste for high salt diets which has been ~einforced over many years; and (2) a dog which is inappetent due to the onset of congestive heart failure.

There is no evidence that high salt intake is beneficial to an animal with heart disease. For these reasons the author believes that sodium intake should be reduced as early as possible in the progression of heart disease, i.e. during Stage 1. The sodium contents of low sodium' diets available in the UK are listed in Table 2.4. All of these diets actually exceed the minimum daily sodium requirement, but compared with other available foods they reduce excessive sodium intake. Reducing sodium intake reduces preload on the heart.

The daily sodium intake is dependent upon the energy density of the food as well as the amount of sodium in the diet. The higher the energy density the less food is needed, so a high energy, low salt diet is recom When changing from a relatively high salt diet, it is best to introduce the new food gradually over a period of 10-14 days, and tit-bits and snacks must be avoided as these are often high in salt content. 'Low salt' diets should not be given to animals that have hyponatraemia (rare), chronic debilitation or chronic diarrhoea.

Other minerals
Long-term diuretic therapy may lead to significant urinary losses of magnesium, iron and zinc, and sometimes potassium. Hypokalaemia may potentiate the toxic effects of digitalis glycosides.

Protein
Hypoproteinaemia is sometimes associated with heart failure due to:

malabsorption removal of fluid accumulations, e.g. ascites.

Dietary recommendations

Mike Davies

Compared with a maintenance ration the basic profile of a diet for a geriatric animal with heart disease should be:
• • • • • • • •

low sodium high energy density increased water soluble vitamins* increased trace elements* increased potassium † high palatability high digestibility high biological value ingredients.

* In the presence of increased diuresis † Care if using potassium-sparing diuretics. Avoid:
• • • • • • •

high sodium intake (particularly snacks / tit-bits) excessive potassium intake (may cause hyperkalaemia) obesity too rapid a weight-loss programme (>3% body weight loss/week for dogs; > 1% body weight loss/week for cats) poorly digestible / poor quality raw ingredients low biological value ingredients any nutritional excess, deficiency or imbalance.

Some animals will have hypoproteinaemia, in which case adequate high biological value protein intake must be maintained, but at the same time excessive protein should be avoided to minimise metabolic stress on liver and kidney particularly if there is evidence of reduced function. Protein intake needs to be adjusted to suit each individual.

Diuretics

Mike Davies

Frusemide and the thiazide diuretics induce water loss by their saluretic action, so concomitant reduction of dietary salt intake is logical and may reduce the dose of diuretic needed. Conversely, high salt intake in patients which have sodium retention may increase the dose of diuretic needed. Diuretics are indicated when the signs of congestion, oedema, ascites or volume overload cannot be controlled by reduced salt intake alone. Typically dogs in Stages III and IV of heart failure will benefit from diuretics, but some individuals in Stage II may also require low dose diuretic administration. Diuretics given in heart failure will reduce circulating blood volume (hypovolaemia) thereby reducing preload effects on the heart, and loop diuretics may cause peripheral vasodilation which also reduces cardiac workload. However, the reduced renal blood flow which also results may be undesirable as it decreases glomerular filtration rate and renal function, and may precipitate acute renal failure. Other undesirable effects of diuretic use include hypokalaemia, hypohypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia. Relative overdosage may cause dehydration and if extracellular fluid is lost without bicarbonate loss, metabolic alkalosis. Some authors advocate routine monitoring of body weight, creatinine, acid-base balance and serum electrolytes (parpotassium) during diuretic therapy. Hypokalaemia enhances cardiac glycoside toxicity, may cause cardiac dysrhythmias and impairs carbohydrate metabolism. Hypomagnesaemia potentiates the cardiac effects of hypokalaemia. Dietary potassium supplementation with salt substitute (KCI) may be helpful in avoiding hypokalaemia, and the use of potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, amiloride or triamterene in conjunction with more potent diuretics such as frusemide, will also help reduce the chances of the development of hypokalaemia, but these drugs should not be used in the presence of other age-related conditions which might predispose to hyperkalaemia such as renal failure or diabetes mellitus. They should also not be used in the presence of metabolic acidosis or alongside therapy with beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g. captopril). To avoid iatrogenic hyperkalaemia, potassium supplementation should not be given at the same time as the potassium-sparing diuretics. The efficacy of diuretics may be reduced in the presence of hypopro(as they are protein-bound), proteinuria or impaired renal function.

Vasodilators
These drugs act primarily on the peripheral vasculature and reduce the workload on the heart. Some vasodilators, e.g. nitrates, cause venodilation, reducing venous return to the heart, and thereby decreasing systemic and pulmonary venous pressures (preload). Others, e.g. hydralazine, cause arteriodilation thus reducing afterload on the left ventricle. Some vasodilators, e.g. prazosin, nitroprusside and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g. enalapril and captopril) have effects on preload and afterload. Conventional vasodilators such as hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate stimulate the sympathetic system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron-ADH system resulting in sodium and water retention, which may be detrimental to some patients. Therefore they are probably best used in combination with cardiac glycosides and diuretics. Concurrent treatment with ACE inhibitors (e.g. enalapril) offers a good therapeutic approach to clinical cases not responding to diuretics and digoxin therapy alone. Marked hypotension can be a problem following the initial oral dose of an ACE inhibitor particularly in patients on diuretics or on a low salt diet, and patients are best hospitalised during the introduction of ACE inhibitors. Any drug that induces hypotension may precipitate prerenal azotaemia and acute renal failure in at-risk patients, and ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in the presence of renal impairment. In old animals renal function should be monitored closely before, and for at least a week after the use of these drugs, and diuretic doses should be reduced when they are administered at the same time.

dogs the main indication is for supraventricular arrhythmias, or for myocardial failure (i.e. congestive heart failure). Digoxin is cleared mainly via glomerular filtration in the kidney (half-life 20-35 hours) whereas digitoxin is cleared via the liver (half-life 8-12 hours) thus concomitant organ disease should be considered and screened out before their administration. In humans digoxin clearance in the elderly is equivalent to the creatinine clearance and its half-life is prolonged in elderly patients. The same is probably true in geriatric dogs and cats, thus sensitivity to digoxin toxicity may be greater in older animals. It has been suggested that the dose of digoxin should be halved if azotaemia is present but a better approach would be to give digitoxin instead. Digitoxin can be cleared by the liver even in the presence of liver disease Both digoxin and digitoxin have a narrow therapeutic margin and there are many factors that may increase the sensitivity of a patient to toxic side-effects including: age, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypercalcaemia, acidosis, calcium channel blockers, antibiotics, renal failure, hypothyroidism. Special care is needed in the administration of these drugs to geriatric patients, and screening for subclinical conditions which might enhance toxic side-effects or alter efficacy is mandatory. The value of monitoring serum digoxin concentrations has been questioned because of overlap in digoxin concentrations seen in groups of patients with and without toxic side-effects, and also because false elevations may be seen in sera from patients with chronic renal failure or liver disease.

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
KEY POINTS
&Nbsp; &Nbsp; (1) Age-related changes in the central and peripheral nervous sys(CNS and PNS) are responsible for many of the physioloand behavioural changes commonly associated with advancing age and senility. (2) Many of the age-related degenerative CNS changes reported to occur in humans are believed by veterinary neurologists to occur in dogs and cats but they have been poorly documented. (3) In decision making about treatment and prognosis it is important to relate observed neurological changes to the site of the underlesion. For example, it is important to differentiate upper motor neuron deficits from lower motor neuron deficits in patients with locomotor disease. (4) The onset of seizures in old animals should promote a search for extracranial causes (e.g. hepatic disease) and for structural lesions in the CNS (e.g. brain tumours). (5) Old patients requiring anticonvulsant therapy for seizures should be screened for liver disease and should be monitored for early detection of hepatotoxicity. (6) Neuroendocrine disorders are probably much more common in old animals than is currently recognised clinically.

3.1 INTRODUCTION

Mike Davies

Age-related changes in the CNS or PNS may result in decreased or increased activity of neural tissue with corresponding signs of altered neurological or neuroendocrine function. A skilled clinician can determine the site of the changes from the neurological signs exhibited by an animal. Reduced protein synthesis within cells is one of the main causes of age-related declines in tissue function and some authors believe that modification of neuroendocrine function offers the best prospect for delaying and reversing ageing changes (Meites 1993). Modification of neuroendocrine function is probably one of the mechanisms by which calorie-restricted diets slow down ageing changes in body tissues, inhibit the development of disease and neoplasia, and significantly prolong the lifespan of rats and mice. Calorie-restricted diets decrease hormone secretion (in particular growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1) and also alter hormone receptor sensitivity, reduce whole-body metabolism (though basal metabolic rate per unit lean body mass remains the same) and lower gene expression. As further support of this hypothesis the administration of hormones thymic peptides and some drugs can improve declining immune function thus improving resistance to infections, neoplasia and autoimmune disorders In old dogs the administration of clonidine (an α 2-adrenergic agonist) increases the pulsatile secretion of growth hormone returning it to a young dog type of pattern. Furthermore administration of clonidine with growth hormone releasing hormone for 10 days significanily increases both the peak concentration and total amount of growth hormone released. A rapid radio-immunoassay for growth hormone in the dog has been described (Cocola et al. 1976). Maladaptive responses of the neuroendocrine system to stressful stimuli (particularly in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system) are thought to accelerate the ageing process and reduce longevity. One study in rats suggests that longevity is inversely related to hyperactivity to stress and that this is genotype dependent. Basal cortisol levels have been reported to be increased in dogs and to be related to cognitive dysfunction associated with ageing. During ageing, humans, rats and dogs have been shown to have

hypercortisolaemia and diffuse Alzheimer's-like brain lesions (extracellular A4amyloid deposits and intracellular fibrillar structures (TAU-protein) called neurofibrillary tangles) and neuronal decay have been reported to occur in dog brains (Cummings et al. 1993; Morys 1994). Recently a direct correlation has been demonstrated between behaviour changes as determined by cognitive tests and the severity of these pathological changes in beagles and these workers have suggested that cushingoid dogs might be a useful model for the study of Alzheimer's disease in humans (Ruehl, W.W. 1995, personal communication). Free radical damage may play a part in the age-related changes in catecholamine neurones in the hypothalamus and in the neurotransmission of catecholamines, acetylcholine and peptide co-transmitters. Changes in receptor-site numbers or sensitivity may decrease secretion from cells which are otherwise still capable of manufacturing hormones.

3.2 AGE-RELATED TISSUE CHANGES Central nervous system
In most organs ageing results in reduced cell division and replacement of active cells with connective tissue, however in the brain there is little connective tissue and postmitotic neuronal death results in a proliferation of active glial elements. With advancing age the CNS may undergo morphological and chemical changes (see Table 3.1 and Table 3.2). Table 3.1 Morphological changes that may been seen in the CNS with advancing age. Reduced brain mass Reduced number of neurones Enlargement of the ventricles Increased lipofuscin deposition in neurones Leptomeningeal thickening Reduced number (denudation) of dendritic spines Astrocyte hypertrophy (gliosis) Argyrophilic (senile) plaque formation Corpora amylacea formation Perivascular haemorrhage is reported to be

Increased water content in the brain. Neurotransmitter enzyme concentrations may change with age. In the monoaminergic system there are increased levels of monoamine oxidase and decreased levels of noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin (5-HT). Neurotransmitter receptors may change in number with age, for example D2 dopamine receptors reduce in number in rodents and humans, whereas the Dl dopamine receptors increase in number. Serotonin receptors S1 and S2 both decrease in numbers with age. In the cholinergic system the presynaptic marker acetylcholinesterase is reported to increase in concentration with age whereas choline acetyltransferase decreases. There is a decrease in the number of muscarinic receptors. Neuropeptide neurotransmitters show variable age-related changes in concentrations in different regions of the brain. Vascular disease such as arteriocapillary fibrosis or endothelial proliferation may reduce blood flow to the brain and so reduce oxygen transport and nutrient supply to the nerve cells, resulting in hypoxia and accumulation of intracellular waste products leading to functional decline with or without neuronal loss.

Peripheral nervous system
Morphological changes Segmental demyelination and wallerian-type degeneration have been described to occur with advancing age in humans, but the changes are usually mild. Slowing of peripheral and central nerve conduction has also been demonstrated in elderly people. Peripheral neuropathies may develop secondary to metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. In the cat diabetic neuropathy is associated with distal axonal degeneration and affected animals show hind limb paresis with distal muscle atrophy and hyporeflexia.

3.3 FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

Mike Davies

There are many functional changes that can occur with advancing age:

Central nervous system
Impaired neurotransmission results from the decreased production of neurotransmitters and reduced breakdown of those that are produced. Reduced serotonin levels increase sleeping time and may cause neudisorders and depression. Depletion of noradrenaline in the brain is also associated with depression. Hypoxia leads to short-term memory loss, but not a loss of long-term memory. Oxygen supplementation can reverse this memory loss. Signs of senility are frequently recognised in older animals and are probably associated with ageing changes in the nervous system but the precise cause-effect relationships have been poorly documented (see Table 3.3).
Table 3.3 Signs of senility frequently recognised in old cats and dogs.

Reduced mental alertness Short-term memory loss Reduced learning ability Poor concentration - reduced attention span Poor motor co-ordination Delayed response to stimuli with slowed or decreased reflex responses Loss of house training Failure to recognise familiar surroundings/companions Personality and other behavioural changes Increased sleeping time

Regular exercise improves many bodily functions probably through its effects on the neuroendocrine system by increasing the secretion of growth hormone and reducing the secretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoids.

Peripheral nervous system

Mike Davies

With advancing age reduced function may occur in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic parts of the peripheral nervous system. Changes may be presynaptic, synaptic or postsynaptic resulting in impaired transmission of impulses to and from the CNS. This may produce abnormal neurological and neuromuscular function leading to sluggish reflexes, reduced pain response, impaired proprioception and difficulty with locomotion. The animal may be less able to respond to sudden stresses placed on it because of impaired ability to maintain homeostasis through neuroendocrine control mechanisms. Inexperienced clinicians may find it difficult to differentiate between proprioceptive deficits and muscular weakness in older animals.

Treatment
Recently two drugs - propentofylline (VMtonin, Hoechst) and nicergoline (Fitergol, Rhone Meneux) - have been granted veterinary product licences based upon their ability to improve the signs associated with ageing in dogs such as lethargy and dullness. They both have numerous pharmaactions on the bod~ but their main mechanism of action is thought to be an increase in b~od supply to the brain resulting in improved neufunctions.

Propentofylline
Is indicated for the treatment of lethargy and dullness in old dogs.

Dose
12.5-100 mg b.i.d. depending upon body weight.

Nicergoline
Is an ∝-adrenoreceptor antagonist and is indicated in the treatment of age-related lethargy and dullness in dogs.

Dose
0.25-0.5 mg/kg daily.

3.4 NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES OF OLD AGE CHRONIC 'OLD DOG' ENCEPHALITIS
Canine distemper is most prevalent in young dogs, but chronic 'old dog' encephalitis is the neurological manifestation of canine distemper virus (CDV) infection that is seen in adult dogs which have survived the acute infection. Dogs developing this condition are usually over 6 years of age and have serological evidence of systemic immunity. The neurological signs (see Table 3.4) may occur without previous evidence of systemic disease and are usually progressive and irreversible (Greene and Appel 1990; Skerritt 1989). The involuntary muscle twitching (myoclonus) is typical of CDV infection.
Table 3.4 Neurological signs seen in the 'old dog encephalitis' form of canine distemper.

Hyperaesthesia cervical pain Seizures Cerebellar and vestibular signs Visual deficits Behavioural changes Head-pressing Circling Paraparesis or tetraparesis Ataxia Myoclonus

CSF examination for increased protein and increased lymphocyte count may be helpful in diagnosing dogs exhibiting neurological signs. Histologically there is perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in areas of demyelination and neuronal degeneration which may progress to sclerosing panencephalitis in more chronic cases. Canine distemper virus inclusion bodies are present in epithelial and other cells but their sigis not clear (Greene & Appel 1990). Distemper can occur after stress, during concurrent illness or in

immunesuppressed vaccinated dogs. Although vaccination with modified live CDV may confer long-term active immunity to some individuals, most manufacturers recommend booster vaccinations at 1-2 year intervals to ensure adequate ongoing protection. The long-term prognosis is poor for most cases and, although some authors advocate a period of 1-2 weeks supportive therapy, euthanasia is usually the eventual outcome.

Seizures Metabolic Encephalopathies Peripheral Polyneuropathies Neoplasia Reticulosis Spinal Disease Vestibular Disease

SEIZURES
Seizures can begin at any age and if they occur at a frequency greater than once every 6 weeks, or if the animal has clusters of seizures more than once every 8 weeks, anticonvulsant therapy is indicated. The onset of seizures in old animals should prompt a search for an extracranial cause (e.g. hepatic disease) or an intracranial structural lesion (e.g. brain tumour). Phenobarbitone and primidone are the drugs of choice for managing seizures in dogs, and phenobarbitone and diazepam for cats. In 20-25% of dogs seizures are reported to be refractory to treatment with phenobarbitone and 40% and 48% of cases are refractory to primidone. Similar results have been reported for cats (Schwartz-Porsche 1992). The most common cause of failure in treatment is inadequate dosage either by the clinician or due to owner non-compliance. The therapeutic range of serum concentration of phenobarbitone in the dog is 20-40 µg/ ml and for the cat 10-30 µg/ml. The recommended dose rate is 1.5-5.0 mg/kg body weight but if adequate serum concentrations are achieved but seizure control does not occur even higher

doses are recommended by some authors. Intervals between doses should be less than the half-life of the drug in the body to minimise fluctuations in serum concentrations. The serum concentration of a drug is determined not only by dose but also by its bioavailability, metabolism and elimination. In older animals the objective should be to reduce the dose to the minimum needed to maintain serum concentrations within the recognised therapeutic range. The recommended dose of anticonvulsants varies from one author/ reference to another. During the initial treatment of refractory seizures the more rapidly the therapeutic dose is reached the greater the success so a high initial loading dose of phenobarbitone may be beneficial particularly for the most difficult seizures to control in dogs (clusters of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS)) and cats (complex focal seizures). For phea gradually increasing dose rate of up to 10-15 mg/kg body weight orally has been used for these cases (Schwartz-Porsche 1992). Care is needed when using anticonvulsants in old animals - particularly if high doses are needed. The patient should be screened for evidence of impaired liver function and should be carefully monitored to ensure early detection of hepatotoxicity. Primidone is not recommended at high dose rates for out-patients because it causes sedation. It is recommended to be given at 25 mg/kg body weight twice daily orally for both cats and dogs, though some authors advise administration at least three times daily. Diazepam is the drug of choice for the initial control of status epilepticus in cats and dogs at a dose rate of 5-50mg given i.v. in 5-10mg doses followed by slow intravenous infusion at 2-5 mg/h in 5% glucose intrafluid. Orally diazepam is only 2-3% bioavailable but a dose of 0.5-2.0 mg/kg t.t.d. has been recommended for cats. Potassium bromide and mephenytoin have been used successfully as adjuvants to conventional treatment but combination therapy should only be tried if drugs by themselves have proved to be unsuccessful. See Schwartz-Porsche 1992 for a review of adjunctive therapy. In all cases a rapid reduction in dose rate or too sudden a change in treatment can result in relapse and recurrence of seizures.

Drug interactions are common between anticonvulsants and antibiotics, antacids, theophylline, cardiac drugs, steroids and antirheumatics. Phe(e.g. acepromazine), anthelminthics (e.g. piperazine and mebendazole) and metoclopramide administration may lower the seizure threshold and precipitate seizures in a stable case. The incidence of seizures may be altered by the presence of concurrent disease see Table 3.5. For this reason routine screening is advisable in geriatric patients with seizures.

Table 3.5 Concurrent diseases which may alter the incidence of seizures in older animals. Gastroenteritis Hepatic disease Renal disease Pneumonia Metabolic disorders

PERIPHERAL POLYNEUROPATHIES
Neuropathies can occur secondary to multisystemic disorders (e.g. neodiabetes mellitus) so a full clinical examination is necessary (see Table 3.9 for presenting signs). In older animals it may be difficult to difpoor proprioception from severe muscle weakness. (See Wheeler 1989 for a review of how to perform a thorough neurological examination.)

NEOPLASIA Central nervous system

Mike Davies

Brain tumours can occur at any age but the incidence is very rare in aniunder 5 years of age (Skerritt 1989). They are usually focal lesions and cause neurological signs directly related to the site at which they occur. Localisation of brain tumours can be achieved from a complete neurological examination and the use of modern imaging techniques particomputerised tomography (CT scans) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Plain radiography is rarely helpful unless the tumour involves the bony parts of the cranium causing osteolysis or new bone deposition, and the use of contrast studies (positive or negative) alone is less reliable than CT or MRI. Many brain tumours produce hot spots' that can be detected by scintigraphy and photon emission computed tomography Meningiomas are the most common form of brain tumour in dogs and cats. In the dog these and gliomas are often locally invasive, and gliomas are particularly aggressive. Some brain tumours are accessible to surgery and, if benign and well described, may be successfully removed, e.g. meningiomas in cats, but the prognosis is guarded. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy have also been reported to lead to remission in some patients.

Spine
Spinal tumours can occur at any age but (with the exception of lymphoare most prevalent in older animals. They may cause pain or neusigns which are usually insidious in onset. Spinal tumours are uncommon in dogs but account for up to 50% of cats with spinal disease, though many of these are lymphosarcoma in young individuals. CSF examination is sometimes helpful, but myelography is usually needed to identify the site of the lesion. Extradural tumours are usually primary bone neoplasms and occasecondary (e.g. from a prostatic carcinoma). In cats lymphois the most common extradural tumour. Radiographic findings may include new bone deposition, bone loss or vertebral collapse. Surgery is possible for some tumours and medical treatment and/or radiotherapy for others. Intradural neoplasms are usually either:

meningiomas which in dogs occur most often in the cervical spine where they may be amenable to surgery; or nerve sheath tumours including neurofibromas and neurosarcomas which often occur in the brachial plexus and are difficult to remove surgically.

Primary intramedullary tumours are the least common. They are usually glial cell tumours or result from secondary metastatic spread. The prognosis for patients with spinal tumours is guarded.

Peripheral nerves
Neoplasia of the brachial plexus are most prevalent in middle-aged and old animals and in dogs they are most often nerve sheath tumours, e.g. schwannomas, neuromas and neurofibromas. They are usually slow growing but are locally invasive and though they rarely spread to the lungs the prognosis is poor. In dogs a mean age of 7.4 years has been reported for brachial plexus tumours (Sharp 1989) Most of the dogs were medium or large breeds and they all presented initially with unilateral intractable foreleg lameness or paresis with muscle atrophy and pain. The spinatus muscles over the scapular were most often involved. Over 45% had radiological or clinical evidence of spinal cord compression or invasion and often a small mass was palpable in the axilla. Homer's syndrome may occur in conjunction with these tumours in both dogs and cats.

Diagnosis Biopsy of the tumour tissue which is hard and discoloured grey or off-white is possible during exploration of the plexus (Sharp 1989).

Treatment In dogs with spinal cord involvement dorsal laminectomy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess for surgical removal by a craniolateral approach (Sharp 1988). If the proximal border of the tumour can be identified high limb amputation with removal of local spinal nerves is the treatment of choice as local excision will usually result in severe neurolodeficits and local recurrence of the tumour. Prognosis Guarded. Local recurrence is common.

RETICULOSIS
Reticulosis is an uncommonly diagnosed condition of adult dogs which causes neurological signs either suggestive of a focal lesion with unilateral signs, or with multifocal signs, including hyperaesthesia. These signs are usually slowly progressive. Severe visual deficits may also be associated with reticulosis. CSF examination may help in diagnosis though the neurological signs are usually non-specific. On histological examination the disease is charby perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration with proliferation of histiocyte and microglial cellular elements. Three forms of the disease have been defined cytologically:

granulomatous reticulosis (or granulomatous meningoencephalitis) neoplastic reticulosis and microgliomatosis.

Prednisolone at 1-2 mg/day orally has been recommended as treatfor this condition but the long-term prognosis is poor.

SPINAL DISEASE

Mike Davies

There are several diseases that may involve the spinal canal producing clinical signs including neurological deficits and these need to be differRadiography is important in reaching an accurate diagnosis and myelography is usually needed to identify space occupying lesions. Aniwith gait abnormalities should also have nonneurological causes eliminated including osteoarthritis (or degenerative joint disease), hip dysplasia, bilateral osteochondritis dessicans and generalised bone dise.g. renal secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Discospondylitis
Discospondylitis may occur at any age and occurs most frequently in the cervical spine or at the lumbosacral junction. It is an inflammatory process (usually secondary to bacterial infection) of the intervertebral disc space which extends into the vertebral bodies either side and encroaches on the spinal canal. The diagnosis is confirmed by radiology and it needs to be differentiated from spondylosis which is a common incidental radiofinding in older dogs. Cervical spondylopathy usually occurs in an earlier age (up to 7 years in Dobermans).

Degenerative disc disease
Degenerative disc disease is common in young chondrodystrophic dogs and clinical signs associated with disc degeneration are unusual in geriatric patients of these breeds. In other large breed dogs the condition is more likely to be seen in middle-aged or older animals and they usually present with a gradually progressive hindleg ataxia and paresis. Anti-inflammatory drugs are the treatment oT choice, and surgery is less likely to be successful in these patients than in young animals with acute disc prolapse. Somethere is a concurrent degenerative myelopathy.

Chronic degenerative radiculomyopathy
Most central and peripheral myopathies occur in young animals, but chronic degenerative radiculomyelopathy (CDRM) is frequenfly seen in elderly male German shepherd dogs and it is occasionally seen in other breeds. There is degeneration of the lumbar dorsal columns, fasciculus gracilis, lateral corticospinal

tract and around the ventromedian fissure of the white matter of the cord. Lesions also involve the dorsal spinal roots and the thoracolumbar grey matter and nucleus gracilis show asytrocytic sclerosis. These degenerative changes are typical of a 'dying-back' disease (Griffiths and Duncan 1975). The cause is unknown although vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency has been suggested by some workers. Diagnosis is based upon the presenting clinical signs (Table 3.10) and absence of a space occupying spinal lesion on myelography. Treatment is symptomatic, for example the provision of boots to protect the dorsa of the feet and there is no treatment that can reverse the neurological deficit.
Table 3.10 Clinical signs of CDRM. Chronic progressive ataxia with paresis and loss of proprioception but no loss of pain sensation. Excessive wearing of the dorsum of the claws (often with skin abrasions) is usually present due to the feet being dragged along the ground. Flexing the hindpaw with its dorsum to the ground fails to elicit a normal placing reflex and turning the dog in a tight circle causes affected dogs to criss-cross their legs and trip themselves up.

Lumbosacral spondylopathy
There are a number of pathological changes that may occur at the lumjunction leading to signs of low back pain or hyperaesthesia with decreased ability to exercise, difficulty in rising, and sometimes faecal or urinary incontinence. The signs are usually bilateral and weak hock flexion is the main neurological deficit (Denny et al. 1982). Large breed working dogs are most often affected though a similar condition has been reported in smaller toy breeds. The aetiopathogenesis may be due to spinal stenosis, disc protrusion, spondylosis deformans or discospondylitis. Myelography, epidurography, transosseus venography or CT scan are useful for differentiating the cause and electrophysiological testing (EMG) is also helpful.

Decompressive surgical treatment (dorsal laminectomy or foris reported to provide good success, and antibiotic treatment is required for discospondylitis.

VESTIBULAR DISEASE
Both adult cats and dogs can present with acute onset severe vestibular signs including head tilt, circling, leaning and nystagmus In both species the condition is frequently misdiagnosed as stroke' although post-mortem examinations of the brain in such cases have failed to detect the presence of haemorrhages or infarcts. The aetiopathogenesis of this syndrome is unknown but it needs to be differentiated from vestibular signs associated with infection (particularly from otitis externa/interna/media, or haemotogenous spread), toxicity (particularly antibiotics such as neomycin, streptomycin and gentamicin), nutritional deficiency (e.g. thiamin deficiency in cats) or neoplasia. Vessigns associated with neoplasia are usually slowly progressive and refractory to treatment. No specific treatment can be recommended but in both species the condition is self-limiting. Dogs are usually normal within 1-2 weeks, cats in 2-3 weeks.

THE SPECIAL SENSES

KEY POINTS
&Nbsp; (1) Ageing changes may occur in all sensory organs leading to a gradual reduction in sensitivity and response to external stimuli. (2) If the loss of sensory perception occurs gradually owners may not notice that the sense is being lost in their pet. (3) Ageing changes are irreversible so any age-related loss of sensory perception is permanent. Adjusting the lifestyle of the pet can minimise the effects of loss of the special senses. 4.1 AGEING CHANGES IN MAJOR SENSE ORGANS 4.2 SUMMARY

Mike Davies

NOSE
Loss of smell may occur with advancing age but there is no evidence that this is a significant problem in old cats and dogs. In part this may be because recognition of loss of smell is a problem for owners and veterinary clinicians because there is no change in behaviour pattern apart from reduced appetite which specifically indicates that such a loss is present.

Age-related diseases
There are a number of age-related diseases that may affect the nose, the most important of which are intranasal neoplasia and chronic rhinitis.

Neoplasia
The average age of dogs and cats with intranasal neoplasia is reported to be 9 years. The condition is less common in cats. In the dog most neoplasms are adenocarcinomas. In cats benign polyps which extend to the nasopharynx are also seen. Nasal tumours are locally invasive and cause destruction of bone which can be identified on radiography and loss of the fine trabecular pattern of the nasal turbinates is a sign of early nasal neoplasia. This is best demonstrated on intra-oral dorsoventral projections. Spread to local tisincluding the eye and brain is common. Clinical signs include sneezing, nasal discharges including epistaxis, obstructed air flow when breathing and later deformity of the face or clinical signs associated with spread to adjacent structures such as the brain. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, radiography and excisional biopsy. Flushing

the nasal cavity to extract exfoliated cells for cytological examination might also be a useful technique in some cases. Treatments that have been reported to be successful in some cases include surgery, surgery with radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone but the prognosis is always poor-guarded.

Chronic rhinitis
Chronic rhinitis may be a consequence of bacterial, viral or fungal infection, trauma or foreign bodies. Only about 50% of cases will respond to treatment and the prognosis is poor-guarded. Treatment is dependent upon an accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause. Even if micro-biological culture and sensitivity indicates a specific therapeutic approach complete success may not be achieved because the infection is in a cavity, and for this reason some clinicians prefer to flush through trephined holes or a nasal bone flap - particularly for the treatment of aspergillus or infections extending into sinuses. Partial or complete turbinectomy can be performed in some cases, and some authors advocate complete bilateral extirpation of all turbinate tissues (Gourley and Vasseur 1985).

EAR
Apparent loss of hearing is commonly seen in old dogs, but rarely reported in old cats. Owners notice that their pet is slow to respond to auditory stimuli such as the noise of them being called, whistles, the sound of the owner entering the room, or loud bangs such as doors slamming or fireworks. Sometimes owners can recognise complete deafness when their dog fails to respond to all auditory stimulation but does respond immediately to visual recognition. Chronic inflammation can lead to thickening and pigmentation of the skin lining the ear canal and this may lead to narrowing of the external auditory meatus. This in itself may not cause a significant impairment in hearing.

EYE
There are many age-related changes which can be recognised in eyes including the following:

Eyelid papillomas
Papillomas or warts are very common in old dogs particularly on the eyelid margins. Excision is indicated when they impinge on the cornea causing irritation, inflammation or self-trauma. Melanomas and carcinomas occur occasionally, but they are rare.

Cysts of the gland of Moll
These cysts are usually small and have a vesicular appearance. They do not cause clinical problems but can be surgically excised if necessary.

Increased tear viscosity
Increasing tear viscosity will reduce the rate of flow of tears across the corneal surface, thus reducing the ability of the tear film to wash away particulate matter that might collect on the surface.

Decreased lysozyme activity
Reduced lysozyme activity may lead to increased susceptibility to infection.

Corneal pigmentation
Corneal pigmentation with melanin is a common condition in dogs and is usually secondary to inflammation or some other corneal or uveal disease. If heavy pigmentation is present it will result in impaired vision. If a primary cause cannot be identified (e.g. entropion, trauma, distichiasis, trichiasis, neoplasia (melanoma), keratitis sicca etc.) senile corneal degeneration should be considered as a possible cause. Treatment depends upon the underlying cause. If surgical correction of a primary cause is not possible, corticosteroid therapy can be successfully employed in most cases. Superficially pigmented areas can be excised surgically.

Lipid deposits may appear in the corneal stroma, and sometimes other materials can become deposited.e.g. calcium. Treatment is rarely indicated but an underlying cause should be sought (e.g. hyperlipidaemia, hypercalcaemia) and treated if possible.

Iris atrophy
This is rare but can lead to blockage of the drainage angle resulting in glaucoma.

Nuclear sclerosis
With advancing age fibres near the centre of the lens become compressed and this, with concomitant loss of water causes an increase in density of the lens nucleus (called sclerosis) which gives a blue-grey tinge to the lens. Nuclear sclerosis affects most dogs over 6 years of age to some degree or other, but transmission of light to the retina is not affected, the fundus is visible on ophthalmoscopic examination because the discoloured lens is still translucent and vision is not seriously impaired. No treatment is needed although there have been unsubstantiated anecdotal reports of nuclear sclerotic lesions disappearing following a change in diet from an adult maintenance ration to one formulated specifically for old dogs.

Cataracts
Senile cataracts are common in dogs and most dogs over 9 years will have some evidence of cataract formation. Usually the opacity progresses slowly and it may affect the nuclear or cortical part of the lens. They are usually blue-grey initially progressing to yellow or even brown with maturity. Despite the obvious opacity vision is often not severely impaired. (1) (2) (3) Nuclear cataracts form as a result of the normal process of nuclear sclerosis. Cortical cataracts are most commonly seen in old dogs and are due to the accumulation of fluid within the lens cortex. Diabetic cataracts may appear earlier in life (from 2 years of age). They are usually bilateral and progress rapidly. The lens changes may be reversed if treated early enough. Punctate cataracts have been reported in association with hypoparathyroidism and

renal insufficiency.

Mike Davies

Impaired vision due to cataract formation is manifest as bizarre behavioural changes including barking at imaginary objects. There is no satisfactory medical treatment for cataracts and various surgical approaches (e.g. extraction, phaecoemulsification) have been recommended.

Asteroid hyalosis
Calcium deposits called asteroid bodies are sometimes seen in the vitreous of ageing animals. They are usually only present in one eye and appear like small white round deposits. The cause is unknown, they do not cause problems and do not require treatment.

Vitreous liquefaction
This degenerative change is often seen in old animals and those that have cataracts.

Loss of rods and cones
An age-related decrease in numbers of rods and cones results in decreased visual acuity, and could result ultimately in visual impairment.

Retinal detachment
Retinal detachment is common in cats and an occasional finding in dogs. It is often bilateral and is usually secondary to hypertension such as occurs in chronic renal failure. Detachment can be slow or sudden and total detachment results in blindness.

Cystoid retinal degeneration

Mike Davies

Cystoid retinal degeneration is common, particularly in the region of the ora serata, and it is regarded as a normal ageing process.

Neoplasia
Retinal neoplasia is rare and usually secondary to uveal tract neoplasia when it does occur. Uveal tract tumours are more common and most involve the ciliary body or extensive areas of the uveal tract. Most are malignant and pigmented neoplasms are usually melanomas. Usually only one eye is affected. Differentiating pigment changes of the iris from malignant melanoma can be difficult or even impossible. Because of this, and because melanoma within the eye tend to metastasise slowly (unlike malignant melanoma of oral origin), enucleation should only be performed when the pigmented mass grows rapidly, it develops an irregular contour, causes local discomfort or there are intraocular haemorrhages. When metastasis does occur it can be to the brain, lungs or elsewhere in the body. In cats lymphosarcoma of the iris may be associated with positive feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) status. The net effect of slowly progressive age-related changes leads initially to loss of visual acuity then to visual impairment and finally to blindness. Full ophthalmological examination is needed and should be incorporated into any geriatric screening programme. It should include ophthalmoscopy, assessment of pupillary reflexes and the menace reflex.

TONGUE
Loss of taste sensation may occur with advancing age but there is no evidence that this is a common problem in cats and dogs. The likely effects of such a loss would be reduced appetite and some authors have described malnutrition in surgical cases involving the nasal passages.

Neoplasia

Mike Davies

Neoplasia of the tongue is uncommon in dogs, but there is a relatively high incidence in cats. In the cat most neoplasms are squamous cell carcinoma, and others include fibrosarcoma, papilloma and haemangioma. In dogs malignant melanoma is the most serious as it is highly malignant, the fibrosarcoma and squamous cell carcinoma are also seen. All carry a poor prognosis. If localised surgical excision may be possible (e.g. papillomas) and in cats radiotherapy has been suggested as the best treatment for squamous cell carcinoma. Some haemangiomas are corticosteroid responsive, but there is no satisfactory treatment for fibrosarcoma though radiotherapy or hyperthermia may be helpful in some cases.

Uraemia
Ulceration around the lingual margin and severe halitosis is associated with advanced uraemia due to renal failure.

4.2 SUMMARY
With advancing age most cats and dogs probably lose some of their sense of smell, hearing, sight and taste, however they cope very well in familiar surroundings and owners are unlikely to recognise serious behavioural or other problems unless there is a total loss of sense, e.g. blindness, deafness

URINARY TRACT
KEY POINTS
(1) Chronic renal failure is common in old cats and dogs and is a major cause of death. (2) It is generally accepted that chronic renal failure is a slowly procondition whatever the initial cause of the disease and it is believed that proper clinical management may delay or stop progression. (3) Urinary incontinence and/or inappropriate urination is comreported in dogs and cats with advancing age, and is a major reason for euthanasia being requested by owners. (4) Dietary management is an important management tool in urinary tract disorders. (5) Screening for evidence of renal impairment is important before the administration of therapeutic agents or a general anaesthetic to old patients. 5.1 UPPER URINARY TRACT: AGE-RELATED CHANGES 5.2 DIETARY MANAGEMENT 5.3 LOWER URINARY TRACT: DISORDERS OF URINATION 5.4 LOWER URINARY TRACT: PROSTATIC DISEASE REFERENCES AND FURTHER READING

5.1 UPPER URINARY TRACT: AGE-RELATED CHANGES

Mike Davies

The following changes have been reported to occur with advancing age (after Mosier 1988 and Breitschwerdt 1988):
• • • • • •

reduced renal size reduced number of nephrons reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduced renal plasma flow reduced tubular excretion reduced tubular reabsorption.

Compensated renal failure is present in many older animals. In one recent survey of 13 apparently healthy cats aged over 7 years of age all of them were found to have blood creatinine with /or without increased urea concentrations above the published normal range (Barber, P.1995 percommunication), and in another survey of 1600 dogs aged over 5 years 22.4% were found to have evidence of azotaemia (Leibetseder & Neufeld, 1991). Recent studies at the Royal Veterinary College, Uniof London have been unable to detect an age-related decrease in GFR using non-invasive radioactive technetium. Early detection of the presence of renal failure is desirable to facilitate early intervention in an attempt to delay or stop progression and also to identify individuals in which renal excretion of drugs may be impaired, and those at risk of developing acute renal failure if stressed by the adminisof some drugs, e.g. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), some antibiotics or the administration of a general anaesthetic.

5.2 DIETARY MANAGEMENT
Dietary management is very important in the management of renal disease in older animals due to the effect that diet has on:

Calorie intake
All animals have a requirement for energy which has to be met by dietary intake. The energy requirements of animals during their life cycle stages have been reasonably well established (NRC 1985; NRC 1986; Lewis et al.1987) but the energy requirements of animals with renal disease have yet to be accurately determined. Assessing the body weight of an animal is important in estimating the calorie requirements of an individual. A reduction in calorie intake should be considered for animals that are obese, and calorie intake should be increased for animals that are underweight. Cats and dogs with renal disease frequently present in a catabolic state and they need a high calorie intake to maintain body functions and to restore normal body weight. This may not be easy to achieve, as animals in a debilitated state or with azotaemia are frequently anorectic. Uraemic animals may vomit any food that is eaten, and in the presence of concomitant gastrointestinal or hepatic dysfunction, ingestion may not guarantee adequate utilisation of the food. The diet for such cases should therefore be high in energy density and digestibility to minimise the amount of food that the animal has to digest and absorb. Feeding small volumes of food frequently (3-4 times daily) may improve utilisation. Hand feeding, warming the food and sometimes the administration of diazepine drugs (e.g. diazepam at a dose rate of 2-14 mg/kg orally (dogs) or 1-2 mg/cat orally or 0.1-0.5 mg/cat given intravenously; or oxazepam at a dose rate of 2 mg/cat orally) may encourage eating in anorectic patients (Lewis et al. 1987). Diets claiming good palatability should be selected carefully to avoid those containing high levels of nutrients (e.g. salt) that might be contraindicated in the presence of renal disease. Studies in man have demonstrated an improvement in ability to mainnitrogen equilibrium by increasing the calorie intake of uraemic patients on a low-protein, high biological value protein diet (Hyne et al. 1972). A high calorie-dense diet reduces the amount of food that has to be eaten to meet daily energy needs, and this can be helpful in reducing the total intake of specific nutrients that have to be controlled, e.g. phosintake will be less if less food is

eaten.

Mike Davies

Cats, being obligate carnivores, have a high requirement for energy from dietary protein. In the presence of inadequate protein-calories a cat will breakdown its own body protein to produce energy, hence severe dietary protein restriction is not as feasible in the cat as it is in the dog.

Renal blood flow
Loss of renal function is commonly slow and progressive with a profall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) caused by increasing loss of functional nephrons. One mechanism by which this progress is believed to occur is the 'hyperfiltration theory' (Brenner et al. 1982). This theory is based upon the increased workload on functioning nephrons, in kidneys in which renal reserve has been lost due to injury. Under such circumstances surviving nephrons are subjected to intraglomerular hypertension and hyperperfusion which can result in glomerular injury (sclerosis) and further loss of function. Ingestion of a meal causes a postprandial increase in renal perfusion and filtration and by cumulative effect this is thought to be responsible for hyperfiltration and the<renal hypertrophy seen in animals maintained on high protein diets. In the dog changing from a carbohydrate to a meat diet increases renal blood flow and filtration rates by as much as 100% (Shannon et al. 1932; Pitts 1944). This increase in renal blood flow is thought to be mediated by a hormone (e.g. glucagon) or other factor (Rocha et al. 1972; Aoki et al. 1976; Johannesen et al. 1977). In the presence of decreasing renal function, therefore, feeding a low protein diet is indicated to decrease further glomerular damage caused by the above effects on renal haemodynamics. It has also been suggested that augmented intrarenal pressures and flows associated with ad libitum feeding might contribute to age-related glomerular sclerosis (Brenner et al. 1982), but whether or not diet induced changes can result ultimately in disease, remains controversial. In experimental models reducing dietary protein intake has been assowith

decreased progression of renal haemodynamics (Hostetter et al. 1981) and improved longevity (Kleinknecht et al. 1979; Salusky et al. 1981). Other studies have demonstrated accelerated glomerulosclerosis in uninephrectomised rats fed high protein diets (Blatherwick & Medlar 1937; Lalich et al. 1975) and retardation of the progression of renal failure in rats (Farr & Smadel 1939; Neugarten et al. 1982; Friend et al. 1978), and in mice (Farr & Smadel 1939), by feeding a protein restricted diet. Increasing glomerular pathology as evaluated by light microscopy (including glomerulosclerosis) has been reported in nephrectomised dogs fed increasing levels of dietary protein (Bovee et al. 1979; Robertson et al. 1986). Several studies in dogs with renal failure have shown that dietary protein restriction reduces proteinuria, an indicator of glomerular injury (Polzin et al. 1983; Polzin et al. 1984; Polzin & Osborne 1988) and recent studies show that glomerular hyperfiltration may promote the development of glomerular sclerosis in dogs with chronic renal failure (Polzin et al. 1988). In humans a prospective, randomised study has recently been reported (Ihle et al. 1989) after which the authors concluded that dietary protein restrictions was effective in slowing the rate of progression of chronic renal failure. Protein malnutrition has been shown to be unlikely to occur on a protein intake of more than 1.9 g protein/kg body weight per day in dogs with chronic renal failure (Polzin et al. 1991). Protein intake below this amount did not further reduce hyperfiltration and hence would be of no additional benefit in reducing glomerular injury. Systemic hypertension has been reported in dogs with acute and subinterstitial nephritis (Anderson & Fisher 1968) and in 58-93% of dogs with renal failure (Cowgill 1982; Weiser et al. 1971). The presence of systemic hypertension may result in intraglomerular hypertension, although it is not necessarily present for the development of the laffer. Animals with renal insufficiency are unable to regulate sodium excretion properly, however net loss of sodium (sodium dumping) was not demonin one study in which sodium intake was decreased abruptly in nephrectomised dogs (Schmidt et al. 1974). Currently it is recommended that the sodium intake for dogs and cats with renal disease be limited to 0.1-0.3% in dry mailer, which is considerably less than the levels in most commercial pet foods (Lewis et al. 1987).

Sodium supplementation is contraindicated, though this was once commonly recommended. Maintaining blood haemodynamics to avoid hypoperfusion and ischaemia is an important objective in the management and prevention of acute renal failure, and interestingly it has recently been suggested that limiting protein intake might reduce the susceptibility of renal tubular cells to nephrotoxic or ischaemic stress, such as occurs in renal failure (Andrews & Bates 1986; Polzin & Osborne 1990). Uraemia is a common occurrence in renal disease, and urea itself may increase renal blood flow, thus having an effect on renal haemodynamics.

Uraemia
The uraemic syndrome results from an inability of the kidney to excrete nitrogenous waste products including urea, and other toxins. Reduction of dietary intake of protein reduces the quantity of circulating proteinaceous waste products and has been shown in many studies in rats, people and dogs to result in marked clinical improvement, increased survival and preserved renal function. A comprehensive reference list has been published (Lewis et al. 1987). It has been shown that people (Walser & Mitch 1977) and dogs (Osborne 1980) with renal failure have a higher requirement for protein than normal individuals and the amount of protein needed will depend upon the severity of the renal dysfunction and the digestibility and quality of the protein in the food. The aim therefore is to feed sufficient high biologic value protein to meet the animal's requirements, but to maintain a blood urea level of 60 mg/dl (10 mmol/l) or less. Approximations of the amount of protein needed in dogs with renal failure to achieve this have been published (see Table 5.1). Clinical signs attributable to uraemia should be controlled at a BUN of less than 60mg/dl (10mmol/l).

Nephrocalcinosis
With decreasing renal function the kidney becomes less able to:
•

degrade parathyroid hormone

•

excrete phosphorus

•

convert vitamin D to its active form.

Reduction in these activities results in bone demineralisation or osteodystrophy and mineral deposition in soft tissues, including the kidneys themselves, which further reduces function. This mineral deposition can occur at normal plasma calcium and phosphorus concentrations in damaged renal tissue, and it can be an early morphological abnormality in animals with renal insufficiency. Dietary phosphorus restriction has been reported to reduce nephrocalcinosis and osteodystrophy even in mild renal insufficiency before increased plasma
Library of veterinary practice 93

phosphorus levels (Maschio et al. 1980). Plasma phosphorus concentrations should be kept at 5.0 mg/dl (1.6 mmol/l) or less, and plasma calcium levels at 10 mg/dl (2.5 mmol/l) or more, with a solubility factor for the two of less than 55 (Massry 1980). Phosphorus restriction significantly reduced the degree of tissue mineralisation in nephrectomised cats when compared with cats fed a normal diet (Ross et al. 1982), and high phosphorus intake in nephrectomised dogs resulted in hyperparathyroidism and severe bone deminerialisation as compared with dogs with reduced phosphorus intake (Rutherford et al 1977). Studies in cats and dogs have demonstrated that phosphate binders are ineffective at the commonly used dosages if diets with unrestricted phosphorus content are fed.

Urine pH
Acidosis may occur with oliguria or severe polyuric renal failure and is due to reduced excretion of sulphates, phosphorus, organic acids, hydrogen and ammonium ions. Metabolic acidosis enhances osteodystrophy and protein catabolism. Acidifying diets should be avoided in animals with renal failure.

When considering the most appropriate dietary regimen for an individual case it is important to perform a full and detailed clinical examination, because renal disease may be associated with concomitant disease in other organ systems, e.g. pyometra (Stone et al. 1988) and heart failure (Ralston & Fox 1988) which may influence dietary choice. Renal disease increases in incidence with increasing age (Muller-Peddinghaus & Trautwein 1977) and so it frequently occurs in individuals that also have compromised cardiac, hepatic or other organ function. The most serious disorder will usually be managed first. Complications may even occur within the urinary tract itself. For example, renal failure precipitated by urinary tract obstruction due to a struvite urolith, presents the clinician with a dilemma, because the diet of choice for renal failure is not ideal for the management of struvite urolithiasis. In such circumstances the clinician needs to use his/her clinical Library of veterinary practice 94

judgement to manage the case most effectively.

Summary of dietary management
1. Chronic renal failure Feed a diet that is:
• • • • •

high in energy-density low in protein content (contains high biological value protein) low in phosphorus content low in sodium content buffered against acidosis.

e.g. Prescription Diet Canine or Feline k/d; Prescription Diet Canine u/d (Hill's Pet Nutrition).

2. Glomerular Disease (nephrotic syndrome) Protein loss into the urine accompanies glomerular disease and may lead to hypoproteinaemia. Feed a diet with the same profile as that listed above for chronic renal failure. It used to be advised that extra high biological value protein in the form of whole egg or cottage cheese should be added if the animal developed hypoproteinaemia, however recent evidence suggests that increasing dietary intake of protein only results in increased urinary excretion. Furthermore the effect of the increased protein on renal haemodynamics (see above) might make this practice more harmful than beneficial.

5.3 LOWER URINARY TRACT: DISORDERS OF URINATION
Inappropriate urination is commonly reported to occur in older dogs and cats that have previously been house trained, and this behaviour change is frequently a reason for owners seeking euthanasia (Ruehl W.W., personal communication). In some individuals the micturating reflex may be abnormal due to impaired neuromuscular function (either locally or in the CNS) with loss of conscious voluntary control of urination (Oliver 1987). In other cases the individual may be exhibiting behavioural changes due to senile changes in the CNS (see Chapter 3). Urinary incontinence is common in old bitches and has been linked to ovarohysterectomy by some authors but the evidence from long-term studies have still to confirm such an association. Failure of the urethral sphincter mechanism is the underlying problem and some cases respond to aestrogen therapy (stilboestrol - orally at 0.1-1 mg daily for 3-5 days followed by weekly treatment has been recommended). Urethral tone can be improved by administering ∝-adrenergic stimulants (with or without concurrent use of oestrogens) and phenylpropanolamine is currently recommended at 1.5 mg/kg b.i.d. or 1 mg/kg t.i.d. Involuntary voiding of urine may be primary (associated with a neuromuscular disorder of the bladder) or secondary to a primary condition such as urinary tract infection or neoplasia. Although rare, primary detrusor muscle disorders may respond to anticholinergic drugs, e.g. propantheline at a dose rate of 7.5-15mg t.i.d. Any condition that causes bladder wall irritability (e.g. cystitis) can lead to frequent micturition which can easily be confused with incontinence by owners. Urinary incontinence can be a sequel to urine retention for example due to urolithiasis, or spinal injury or disease.

Urethral disease
Urethral disorders are not common in old cats or dogs. Clinical signs are usually dysuria and haematuria. Obstruction may be caused by uroliths, foreign bodies or neoplasms. In male cats with feline urologic syndrome (FUS or feline lower urinary

tract disease) urethral scarring and stenosis may be a complication following repeated attempts at catheterisation. If obstruction is prolonged urinary incontinence may be a complication once the obstruction is removed.

5.4 LOWER URINARY TRACT: PROSTATIC DISEASE
Diseases of the prostate are rare in cats but are common in older dogs and all may present with similar histories and clinical signs:
• • • •

pain - caudal abdomen on palpation or movement and on defaecation constipation straining - on defaecation or urination dysuria - common in humans but not very common in dogs.

Secondary complications include prostatitis (common in older dogs and one possible cause of intractable haematuria) and perineal rupture. It is important to differentiate benign hyperplasia (which is common) from prostate neoplasia (carcinoma) which is less common and life-threatening. Paraprostatic cysts are also seen occasionally and these may complicate the diagnosis. Radiography, ultrasound and physical examination are all useful diagnostic aids which can be further reinforced by prostatic washes or biopsy If prostatic carcinoma is suspected, survey radiographs should be performed to identify evidence of metastatic spread, especially to the lungs, and also to bone and lymph nodes Surgical removal can be difficult but is successful in providing remission in some cases. Usually it is combined with castration. I have had some success with surgical excision and cryoon tissue that is difficult to resect locally. For prostatic hyperplasia, castration with or without therapeutic agents such as stilboestrol is indicated. In old dogs that are an anaesthetic risk, medical treatment alone may be necessary. Paraprostatic cysts (often there are more than one lying alongside the urinary bladder) are difficult to manage, there being no medical therapy, and surgical techniques such as excision and marsupialisation to provide permanent drainage being reported to have mixed success. I prefer to attempt surgical resection. Prostatitis can be difficult to treat and quite often antibiotic therapy has to be continued for 6-8 weeks. Ideally the antibiotic of choice will be based upon culture and sensitivity tests and it is important that the diagnostic laboratory test for sensitivity is based upon urine concentrations of the drug and not just the blood concentrations achieved. A history of chronic haematuria or urinary tract infection in male dogs should always suggest the possibility of prostatitis.

There are three main differential diagnoses of prostatic disorders in old dogs (see Table 5.2). Other, less common, prostatic disorders include prostatic cysts and trauma. Aids to diagnosis include:
• • • •

radiography ultrasound biopsy prostatic massage/flushing.

If oestrogen therapy does not induce regression biopsy An age-related hormonal imbalance has been suggested as the cause*

Must radiograph and/or use ultrasound to establish whether or not there is a local metastatis (e.g. to the pelvis) or widespread metastatis (e.g. to the lungs or liver)

* Dihydrotestosterone accumulates in hypertrophic canine (and human) prostates and dihydrotesterone snd testosterone do not induce hvpertrophy whereas 3 aandrostanediol and 17b-estradiol (both secreted by the testis) do produce hypertrophy. Furthermore antioestrogen drugs (e.g. tamoxifen) or antiandrogens (e.g. cyproterone) cause glandular atrophy in both spontaneous and experimental canine prostatic hypertrophy.

NEOPLASIA IN OLD AGE
KEY POINTS
(1) Neoplasia is common in cats and dogs and should be considered in the differential diagnosis list of any geriatric animal presenting with non-specific signs such as weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria or recurrent signs such as pyrexia. (2) Whenever possible avoid exposure to known risk factors. (3) Vaccination against viruses that can cause cancer (e.g. feline leukaemia virus) should be widely practised. (4) Early detection and treatment is desirable, so the regular screening of animals through middle age and old age is recom (5) However benign a tumour looks - always biopsy neoplasms to obtain a definitive laboratory diagnosis. (6) Surgery and chemotherapy can be employed successfully for the treatment of neoplasia - even in the most debilitated of old anibut additional screening and supportive management may be necessary to avoid undesirable but predictable age-related complications. (7) Nutritional support is important for the successful management of neoplasia in geriatric patients.

6.1 INTRODUCTION

Mike Davies

Neoplasia is the uncontrolled multiplication of abnormal cells which do not respond to normal homeostatic controls and yet they are poorly recogas being abnormal by the body's normal defence mechanisms. This allows them to proliferate, invade locally, undergo metastatic spread and ultimately cause clinical signs of disease or even death. The key features of a neoplasm which differentiate it from other forms of cell growth are: (1) (2) (3) excessive tissue growth unresponsive to normal control mechanisms not dependent upon initial stimulus to be present for continual growth.

Growth factors are the major regulators of mammalian cell growth in the body and they act via receptors on the cell surface. It is known that some genes which can induce the development of neoplasia (oncogenes), work through their action on growth factors (GF), GF receptors or proteins involved in transferring GF signals across the cell membrane (Slauson & Cooper 1990). Neoplastic cells (particularly those in malignant tissue) are different from normal cells and in vitro demonstrate changes in biochemistry, antikaryotype and cell surface characteristics. Neoplasms are classified as benign or malignant based upon their characteristics (see Table 6.1). Table 6.1 Characteristics of benign and malignant neoplasms. Characteristic Benign Histological differentiation Well differentiated - similar to originating tissue Invasion of adjacent tissue Non-invasive. Often well circumscribed and capsulated Rate of growth Slow Mitotic index Low Metastases Never Malignant Usually poorly differentiated Invade adjacent tissues and cross tissue boundaries Rapid High Sometimes

Although there are some factors known to be associated with the development of neoplasia there is no single common biological mechanism that explains why cancer occurs and the initiation and progression of any specific neoplastic growth is influenced by many factors - most of which have still to be fully elucidated.

6.2 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES
Neoplasia is common in cats and dogs but care is needed when interstudies which include statistical analyses relating to prevalence and incidence because for companion animals these studies often contain a relatively low number of animals, and invariably they have been conducted using the case load presented to second opinion referral centres and not those in first opinion practices, or in the population as a whole. Geo-graphical variation in cancer incidence is also an important consideration when comparing reports from different parts of the world. Dorn et al. (1968b) reported the annual incidence rate of neoplasia in dogs to be 381.2 per 100000 population, and Priester & Mantel 1971 reported an annual incidence rate of 687 per 100000 population. Between 34% (Dorn et al. 1968a) and 40% (Priester & Mantel 1971) were reported to be malignant neoplasms in dogs. It has been estimated that 50% of dogs aged over 10 years die of neoplasia (Kitchell 1988). The estimated rate of occurrence for feline neoplasia is 264.3 per 100000 (Hodgkins 1980). The commonest neoplasms reported to occur in dogs and cats are shown in Table 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5. For tumours of the skin, for example, the mean age for almost all types of tumour is over 8 years, and only canine cutaneous histiocytoma and mast cell tumours are commonly seen in animals less than 5 years of age (Dobson and Gorman 1988).

before the recognition of thyroid adenoma as a common cause of hypenthyroidism in middle aged to old cats (no cases having been reported in a cat less than 6 years of age. Most of the papers published on the incidence of neoplasia are generated by academic institutions and are based upon referral cases. This presents us with a serious weakness in interpretation because common easily rectified cases are dealt with by the first opinion practice and are not referred on. For example, testicular tumours, e.g. sertoli cell tumours are common in male dogs and yet they do not feature in Table 6.2. After thyroid adenomas, lymphomas are the most common neoplasms in cats and advancing age is an important factor in some forms but not others.

increases with age there being a peak occurrence at an average age of 8 years, however some neoplasms are also common in younger animals (Table 6.7). The precise relationship between advancing age and the occurrence of neoplasia has not been determined but with advancing time: 1. The likelihood of exposure to influencing factors increases. 2. The duration of exposure to influencing factors present in the envirincreases. 3. The more time there has been for oncogenes to express themselves.

6.3 DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of neoplasia can be simple when a solid mass can be visualised or palpated, or when it can be identified on radiographic or ultrasound examination. But care is needed when considering the visual appearance of a tumour alone because appearances can be deceptive! An innocuous looking tumour of the skin could be a mast cell tumour, or a small black growth in the mouth could be a malignant melanoma, and fibrosarcomas along the gum margin of dogs often look benign (even under microscopic examination they can be misdiagnosed as fibromas) but they are in fact extremely invasive. In all cases the diagnosis should be confirmed by the histopathological examination of a biopsy, or occasionally by the examination of fine needle aspirates or other techniques for obtaining neoplastic cells, e.g. impression smears. In many cases the clinical signs associated with a neoplasm are non-specific and are due to systemic side-effects called paraneoplastic signs (Table 6.8). In geriatric

6.4 TREATMENT

Mike Davies

There are a wide variety of methods available for the treatment of neoplasia in dogs and cats and in geriatric patients it is advisable also to treat the effects of paraneoplastic syndrome. For example, hypercalcaemia is most often due to haematopoietic malignancy (myeloma and lymphoma) and rehydration followed by corticosteroids are indicated. Once the patient is stabilised specific treatment for the neoplasia can be com

Conventional surgery Cryosurgery Laser surgery Hyperthermia Radiotherapy Chemotherapy Immunomodulation Nutrition Euthanasia

Conventional Surgery
Surgical excision is the most effective method of treatment for most canine and feline neoplasms. Benign tumours should be removed completely by surgery, and early, poorly inavassive malignant tumours can also be totally removed. Larger, invasive neoplasms can be debulked, allowing natural defence mechanisms or other treatment modalities such as cryotherapy, radiotherapy, hyperthermia or chemotherapy greater opportunity to be effective. On rare occasions highly malignant neoplasms will metastasise during or immediately after surgery, hence careful planning of surgical technique is necessary to minimise the risk of metastasis. For example, ligate blood vessels leaving a tumour mass before manipulation or cutting. If possible exteriorise the neoplastic mass to isolate it from a body cavity or underlying tissue and pack it off well to prevent inadvertent transfer of malignant cells into the body cavity or local tissues during surgery. Neoplastic tissues should always be handled gently to avoid release of potent substances such as histamine and heparin into the
Library of veterinary practice 112

Canine and Feline Geriatrics
circulation.

Mike Davies

When excising tumours try to assess the limits of abnormal tissue and add an extra margin to ensure that the whole of the neoplastic mass is excised. Remove local lymph nodes if they are involved, but leave them if they are not. Before surgery it is important to screen the patient to ensure that it is capable of surviving the anaesthesia and surgical procedure and both anaesthesia and surgery time should be kept as short as possible. If major organ system disease is present the patient should be stabilised before surgery unless the neoplasm is lifethreatening. For all but the most minor of benign tumours chest radiographs are essential to confirm that lung metastases are not present. Surgically removed neoplastic tissue should always be submiffed for histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis. Surgery is least successful by itself as a treatment for lymphomas (unless an isolated mass), leukaemia, oral carcinomas, bone tumours and feline mammary tumours (which are almost always malignant). Surgical excision is the most effective method of treatment for most canine and feline neoplasms. Benign tumours should be removed completely by surgery, and early, poorly invasive malignant tumours can also be totally.

Cryosurgery
Cryosurgery is the application of freezing cold to destroy abnormal tissues and it offers several advantages over conventional surgery: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. minimal haemorrhage fibrous walls of vessels remain intact can be repeated without an accumulated effect may induce immunostimulation following the release of tumour antigens easy technique.

Disadvantages of cryosurgery include. 1. slow healing 2. scar formation 3. depigmentation of skin and hair coat
Library of veterinary practice 113

Canine and Feline Geriatrics
4. relative cost.

Mike Davies

Cryosurgery works best for tissues in which the cells contain water. It is less successful for tissues with liffle water, e.g. containing keratin, warts. It has been used successfully for superficial tumours on the head and neck and in the oral cavity, and the author has used it successfully for the treatment of prostatic carcinoma following debulking by conventional surgery.

Laser surgery
The application of lasers in veterinary surgery is a relatively recent innovation. However they have been successfully used for the treatment of intraocular and other tumours. The main advantage of laser surgery is the precision of application that is possible using magnification techniques, as this minimises damage to adjacent normal tissues, particularly when access to a tumour is difficult or the adjacent tissues are sensitive and important for normal organ function to remain. The main disadvantage is the relatively high cost.

Hyperthermia
Hyperthermia has been used in the treatment of certain superficial and isolated tumours in dogs and cats but the early success rates reported have been disappointing. However, the technique continues to be used in human medicine notably for the treatment of early diagnosed forms of throat cancer in which recent results have been very encouraging.

Radiotherapy
Although originally employed as a method of treatment in veterinary patients as early as 1906 by Dr R. Eberlein in the Berlin veterinary school, radiotherapy is still only available at some of the veterinary schools, and a few other institutions in the
Library of veterinary practice 114

UK. For this reason no details about recommended radiation dose rates will be given as it is still a specialist field and should only be performed in experienced referral centres. Whatever the method of delivery of the radiation (by irradiation from a beam of orthovoltage X-ray or cobalt-60 gamma rays; by the surgical implantation of radioactive implants (cobalt or caesium needles); by the use of strontium probes; or by the parenteral administration of a radioactive substance such as radioiodine) the clinical challenge of using radiotherapy is to deliver a therapeutic dose of radiation to the target site while minimising its delivery to normal tissues in order to avoid excessive damage to normal tissues. Radiotherapy is indicated for tumours which are not amenable to surand it is most successful when applied to certain tissue types - notably rapidly dividing cells. Table 6.9 gives an outline of the sensitivity of different cell types to radiotherapy.

Table 6.9 Cell sensitivity to radiotherapy. Most sensitive Germinal epithelium Gametes Bone marrow precursors Mucosal linings Intermediate Endothelium Fibroblasts Hepatic epithelium Renal epithelium Least sensitive Erythrocytes Nerve cells Muscle cells

Side-effects of radiotherapy are listed in Table 6.10 and these should be minimised by restricting the area of exposure of normal tissue as much as possible.

Table 6.10 Side-effects of radiotherapy. Alopecia Depigmentation Desquamation Mucositis Necrosis

During therapy these changes can lead to serious gastrointestinal disorders but fortunately the most radiation-sensitive tissues (e.g. epithelial surfaces) are also the most rapid to heal.

cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma oral squamous cell carcinoma localised lymphoma, e.g. mediastinal lymphoma fibrosarcoma solitary mast cell tumours (dogs - but not in cats in which mastocytoma is usually multifocal/systemic thyroid adenoma (cats)

Chemotherapy

The use of cytotoxic (anticancer) drugs in isolation or in combination is an important, if relatively recent, addition to the armoury of treatments for neoplasia in cats and dogs. However these are potentially harmful agents and are best administered by experienced oncologists. As with radiotherapy the clinical skill necessary for the successful use of these drugs is to deliver a therapeutic dose to the site of the cancer, and at the same time minimise side-effects due to normal tissues being affected by these nonselective drugs - which usually affect the growth or cell division phase of tissues. The most common complication is myelosuppression leading to leucopenia, increased risk of infection and sepsis. Toxicity is the main limiting factor in the application of chemotherapy and for this reason combination therapy employing lower doses of drugs with different modes of action is usually preferred. Even with this approach multiple drug resistance can occur with some neoplasms. In all cases the general physical condition of the animal must be good and pretreatihent screening for renal and hepatic impairment is essential. Providing there is no evidence of major organ disease the absolute age of an animal is less important, except in as much as it might limit the period of lifespan that can be expected following chemotherapy. Usually one should aim to provide an animal with a normal quality of life for a period of at least 6 months to 1 year to justify the use of this form of treatment. White blood cell counts should be performed every 2-6 weeks during treatment with cytotoxic drugs as myelosuppression is their main side effect. If the white cell

count falls below 3 x 109/litre the drug dose should be halved. If it falls below 2 x 109/litre the drug should be withheld. Some of the drugs commonly used for chemotherapy in small animal veterinary medicine are listed below in more detail.

Vinca alkaloids Alkylating agents Antitumour antibiotics Other cytotoxic drugs Success of chemotherapy

Vinca alkaloids Vincristine/vinblastine
The vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine are used for the management of cancer and immune-mediated diseases in cats and dogs. They have been most successful when used against lymphosarcoma and haematopoletic neoplasms, mammary neoplasms in dogs, and some sarcomas. Vincristine has also been used for transmissible venereal tumour in dogs. Vinblastine has been used less often mainly for primary lymphoreticular tumours and disseminated mast cell tumours.

The dose rate of vincristine for dogs and cats is in the range: 0.025-0.05 mg/kg body weight, or 0.50 mg/m2 body surface

The induction dose is usually 8 treatments at 14-21 day intervals. The dose rate of vinblastine is: 2 mg/m2 body surface every 7-14 days.

Both drugs are administered by slow intravenous infusion. Perivascular leakage should be avoided because they cause local irritation and necrosis, hence use of an i.v. catheter is preferred. They can also be given mixed with isotonic saline and administered over a 4-6-hour period. Both drugs are metabolised by the liver and excreted via the bile into faeces, so normal liver function is necessary and should be evaluated before their administration.

Alkylating agents
These are widely used and interfere with DNA synthesis. Side-effects include myelosuppression, gametogenesis, alopecia and gastrointestinal irritation. Renal toxicity has also been reported following administration of alkylating agents to old animals - especially to cats.

Cyclophosphamide
The active principal of cyclophosphamide is released by hepatic microenzymes so do not use in old animals if there is evidence of hepatic insufficiency. It is contraindicated if the patient is anaemic (common in renal failure) as it causes further bone marrow suppression. Haemorrhagic cystitis is a serious side-effect which necessitates withdrawal of treatment with this drug.

Low dose rate: 50 mg/m2 body surface orally on alternate days, or for the first 4 days of each second week.

High dose rate: 100-300 mg/m2 orally every 21 days.

Cyclophosphamide is usually used in combination with vincristine or prednisone for the treatment of lymphoma (cats and dogs) or mammary adenocarcinoma. It has also been used for multiple myeloma.

Dogs by i.v. infusion 50-100mg/m2 over 15 minutes. Repeat 4-6 times at 3-4 week intervals

Dogs should be fully hydrated and concomitant antiemetic and diuretic therapy are recommended. Side-effects include nephrotoxicity, vomiting and myelosuppression. The risk of acute renal tubular necrosis is so great with this drug that it should be used with extreme caution in ageing animals, and it is contraindicated if renal impairment is present. The use of cisplatin is contraindicated in cats.

Immunomodulation Prednisone

Corticosteroids such as prednisone are used widely in the treatment of neoplasia because they have antimitotic and cytolytic effects on lymphoid tissue as well as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. They are particularly useful for the treatment of lymphoproliferative disorders, mast cell tumours, and possibly brain tumours.

Dose
10-60 mq/m2 daily or on alternate davs. Side-effects can include pancreatitis and gastrointestinal upsets and with long term use suppression of adrenocortical function.

Nutrition
Cancer cachexia is very common even in patients maintaining normal food intake, indeed weight loss may be the first sign of the presence of a malignancy. In humans patients with cancer cachexia have reduced quality of life, are less responsive to treatment and have reduced survival times compared with similar patients maintaining body weight. The weight loss that occurs in cancer patients is due to a net energy deficiency resulting from inadequate intake, excessive energy expenditure or both. Possible factors include: (1) Reduced food intake: &Nbsp

altered taste or smell sensation

•

intermediary metabolites acting on the satiety centre (e.g. serotonin)

•

hepatic disease

•

paraneoplastic syndrome - hypercalcaemia

•

mechanical disorders - pain, tumour presence, post-treatment.

(2) Hypermetabolism. Increased metabolic rate resulting in increased rate of energy utilization. (3) Energy competition. The neoplasm competes with the body for energy. It has been demonstrated that tumour cells preferentially metabolise glucose using anaerobic glycolysis, which is an energy wasting metabolic pathway, resulting in lactate production. The glu used by the cancer is lost to the patient and the lactate produced is converted by the Con cycle back to glucose, which further utilises energy. It has been estimated that the rate of turnover of glucose in cancer patients is 80% greater than in normal patients. Dogs with lymphoma (before the development of cachexia) have increased lactate and insulin serum concentrations compared with control dogs and therefore they have significant alterations in carbometabolism (Vail et al. 1989). For this reason rehydration with glucose containing or lactated Ringer's solution should be avoided. (4) Impaired gastrointestinal function. This may result in reduced digestion or absorption due to the physical presence of the tumour, a side-effect of treatment or paraneoplastic syndrome. (5) Impaired metabolic function. Impaired metabolic function (e.g. haematopoietic, hepatic, renal or other) may result in impaired transportation, and metabolism of nutrients. (6) Paraneoplastic syndrome. Many tumours induce metabolic changes which contribute to cachexia. (7) Excessive nutrient losses. Losses may be caused by, e.g. gastrointestinal lymphosarcoma, haemorrhage, nephrotic syndrome. (8) Side-effects of cancer treatment. These occur particularly with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and major surgery.

One consequence of cancer cachexia is negative nitrogen balance caused by protein degradation because the tumour uses amino acids for protein synthesis and for energy, at a rate which exceeds the patient's rate of protein synthesis. The resulting loss of lean body mass and protein depletion results in impaired immune function, reduced gastrointestinal function, hypoalbuminaemi~ and poor wound healing. Several changes in lipid metabolism including a net depletion of lipid stores and hyperlipidaemia occur in cancer patients. The latter has been associated with immunosuppression and is possibly related to the poor survival times of some patients. Insulin resistance and sometimes insulin deficiency both develop in some cancer patients and this encourages fat mobilisation and leads to hyperglycaemia and poor glucose utilisation by the body cells, forcing them to use fat and protein for energy. The mechanisms causing these metabolic changes have still to be fully elucidated, but it is known that they can occur before weight loss. Various factors including interferons and interleukons are probably involved as is the polypeptide tumour necrosis factor (also called cachectin) which causes lipid mobilisation, as does toxohormone, another tumour derived hormone. So far therapeutic treatments alone have not proved successful at reversing cancer cachexia, and so whatever the underlying cause adequate and sometimes aggressive nutritional support should be provided for patients showing significant weight loss. Animals in a catabolic state are vulnerable to the side-effects of many of the treatment modalities that are recommended in the management of cancer, so stabilisation is recombefore commencing such treatment. Feeding methods should be designed to:

(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)

increase nutrient intake inhibit gluconeogensis and glycolysis prevent glucose utilisation by the cancer cells maintain nitrogen balance with amino acids provide branched-chain amino acids to decrease brain uptake of tryptophan and excess serotonin synthesis.

Diets containing 30-50% of calories as fat (which cannot be used as an energy source by cancer cells) have been shown to decrease glucose intolerance, fat loss and tumour growth and at the same time increase host weight, nitrogen and energy balance.

Whenever possible patients should be fed a high energy ration orally, but if voluntary food intake is inadequate nasogastric, pharyngostomy, oesophageal or gastric feeding should be employed. For debilitated cases a percutaneous endoscopically placed gastrostomy (PEG) tube is an easy procedure which is now routinely practised in many referral centres. Jejunostomy is another enteral route that can be utilised and, as a last resort, partial or total parenteral nutrition can be performed, but these techniques need to be carried out under the guidance of a trained clinical nutritionist. There is some evidence that zinc supplementation might improve appetite and immune function in cancer patients and some authors recommend supplements. Patients receiving nutritional support should be monitored regularly to assess progress. Body weight change and alterations in other parameters such as serum albumin, blood urea, red blood cell count and white blood cell count should be evaluated every 2 weeks.

Euthanasia
The method (or combination of methods) of treatment employed in a cancer patient must be based upon a critical clinical appraisal of the individual case; will depend upon the availability of different treatment protocols in the veterinary practice and, most importantly, should satisfy the wishes of the owner. For many old people their pet is the main motivating factor that keeps them going and the prospect of losing their companion, particularly because of ‘cancer' which is a very emotive subject, is hard for them to come to terms with. Communication about the diagnosis and case manneeds to be dealt with in a caring and sensitive way. Euthanasia is an important option to relieve suffering in cases in which the quality of life of the animal is unlikely to benefit from surgical or medical intervention. Owners often require sympathetic counselling before, and following the euthanasia

of their pet. This is particularly the case for owners for whom the pet is their last link with a member of the family who has left home, or who is deceased.

7.1 INTRODUCTION

Mike Davies

Manipulation of dietary intake in older animals is necessary when there is either:

(1) frank clinical disease present (2) subclinical disease present (3) the nutritional requirements of the individual have changed.

Commercial pet foods have been formulated specifically for old dogs and in the future it is likely that foods will be developed for older cats as well. The justification for such products is based upon several premises:

(1) That older animals have different nutritional requirements from younger adults. (2) That it is desirable to reduce the dietary intake of certain nutrients because they may be risk factors for the development, onset or progression of age-related changes. (3) That it is desirable to reduce the dietary intake of certain nutrients because they may be risk factors for the development, onset or progression of disease processes. (4) That it is desirable to increase the dietary intake of certain nutrients because of an increased requirement in older animals due to ageing changes in various organ systems. (5) That it is desirable to increase the dietary intake of certain nutrients because of increased requirements due to the likely presence of subclinical disease. (6) That many owners feed their animals a ration that greatly exceeds their nutritional needs.

Insufficient work has been done on the nutritional requirements of older cats and dogs or on the effects of nutrition on age-related changes, and so the first two premises are controversial. However, the role of certain nutrients in some common diseases of old animals is well documented and many of these diseases are often slow and insidious in their onset and progression, and so dietary manipulation may be beneficial. Good examples are endocardiosis in dogs (see Chapter 2 ) and chronic renal failure in both cats and dogs (see Chapter 5 ). It is true that many owners feed rations that grossly exceed the nutritional needs of their animal so reducing dietary intake to meet requirements may be beneficial, will help reduce the likelihood of obesity occurring and is unlikely to be harmful.

7.2 AGE-RELATED CHANGES THAT MAY AFFECT NUTRITION
Age-related changes that may occur and affect nutrition include:
• • • • • • • • •

reduced appetite reduced sense of taste reduced sense of smell reduced secretions - saliva, gastrointestinal secretions (including enrymes) reduced absorption? reduced transportation? reduced utilisation - liver reduced ability to excrete waste products - liver disease, renal disease increased requirement for nutrients - zinc? shift in body weight distribution from lean body mass to fat.

7.3 ENERGY
For any individual, energy requirements may stay the same, increase or decrease with advancing age. There are few studies looking at the energy needs of large numbers of old cats and dogs. With advancing age a fall in basal metabolic rate has been recorded in humans and experimental animals. This is thought to be due to a change in the ratio between lean body mass and fat, there being an increasing tendency to lay down body fat with advancing age. There are several possible explanations for this trend: (1) reduced thyroid hormone activity (secretion or receptor response) (2) other hormonal effects, e.g. sex hormones, catecholamines. Similar effects may also be seen in dogs and cats. Certainly there is an increased incidence of obesity in dogs with increasing age (Edney & Smith, 1986). Energy requirements may also be reduced if an individual is doing less exercise due to changed behavioural patterns or secondary to other problems, e.g. an orthopaedic problem such as degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis. Older animals with reduced energy requirements should have their energy intake reduced otherwise obesity may result. Regular weighing of older animals should be

Canine and Feline Geriatrics
recommended to detect any trend towards weight gain.

Mike Davies

Obesity should be regarded as a serious problem in older cats and dogs. Obese animals have reduced glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinaemia (Mattheeuws et al. 1984a; Mattheeuws et al. 1984b) even in the absence of frank evidence of diabetes mellitus. Gross obesity can significantly reduce cardiovascular and respiratory function and also exacerbates numerous other problems such as skin disorders, and orthopaedic problems. Obesity in cats is a risk factor for the development of hepatic lipidosis and in cats and dogs it is a risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus. Most major organ system diseases seen in older animals (e.g. cardiac disease, renal disease, hepatic disease and neoplasia) result in catabolism and weight loss. This is particularly important in cats which, because of their high protein-calorie requirement rapidly break down their own body muscle and other available proteins in the presence of inadequate protein intake or excessive energy utilisation. Almost all chronic diseases in the cat result in significant weight loss or even cachexia. When energy intake does not meet requirements additional energy should be provided and the selection of energy source (fat, protein or carbohydrates) will depend upon the underlying clinical status of the animal. In cats protein is a major provider of energy because of their obligate carnivorous nature, however fat provides 2.25 times more energy than either protein or carbohydrate and so this will often be the high energy source of choice for both cats and dogs. Carbohydrate will be used when high protein or fat intake is contraindicated in the individual because of the presence of impaired organ function or disease (e.g. renal failure, hyperlipidaemia).

7.4 PROTEIN
The protein requirements for geriatric cats and dogs have not been determined. In the absence of clinical or subclinical disease minimum protein requirements are probably the same as for adults. It must be remembered that cats are obligate carnivores with higher protein requirements than dogs. Protein intake should be maintained near to the minimum requirement in situations in which excessive protein intake is considered to be a risk factor for disease progression (e.g. chronic renal failure); or when excessive protein intake may have a direct clinical effect (e.g. hyperammonaemia in hepatic disease, and uraemia). It
Library of veterinary practice 131

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

is controversial whether or not early dietary restriction of protein may prevent the onset of age-related progression of renal failure, though there is good experimental evidence that avoidance of excessive protein intake delays progression once renal damage is present (see Chapter 5 ). It should be noted that no authorities recommend reducing protein intake below the minimum requirement, and that in the presence of chronic renal failure protein requirements may actually increase to twice that recommended for normal adult animals. Avoidance of unnecessary excesses is recommended not restriction below actual requirements. The term low protein' and protein restriction' which are in common use are therefore somewhat misleading. Geriatric patients benefit from the feeding of high quality protein sources which are:
• •

highly digestible contain high concentrations of essential amino acids.

Protein sources with a high biological value include egg, liver and other animal source ingredients. Cereals have a lower biological value, but feeding a ration containing a mixture of plant and animal source materials can increase the overall biological value of the protein in the food by providing a better balance of amino acids.

7.5 FAT (OILS)
The fat requirement for old cats and dogs has not been determined and, in the absence of subclinical or clinical disease, it is likely to be the same as that for younger adults. Fat is a high energy nutrient and excessive intake is likely to lead to the development of obesity, hence total daily intake should be controlled to maintain a fit healthy body weight. Essential fatty acids have many important roles to play in the body including cell membrane structure and skin and hair coat condition. Some authorities consider supplementation of a ration with essential fatty acids of possible benefit for old animals, and it is unlikely to be detrimental unless excessive quantities are given in the absence of sufficient antiin the ration (e.g. vitamin E).
Library of veterinary practice 132

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

Fat intake should be carefully controlled in the presence of liver disease, pancreatic disease, hypothyroidism and other causes of hyperlipidaemia. Cats and dogs rarely develop coronary artery disease and in these species dietary fat intake does not appear to be a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease.

7.6 CARBOHYDRATE
As long as the food contains sufficient quantities of gluconeogenic amino acids and fat, there is no dietary requirement for carbohydrate in cat or dog rations. However, in feeding trials carbohydrates in the form of starch are well utilised by both cats and dogs and it is a useful raw ingredient. Carbohydrates in the form of dietary fibre may be beneficial in maintaining normal gastrointestinal function in geriatric patients because of their effects on motility and the water content of stools. They may decrease the occurrence of constipation in animals predisposed to develop it - though few clinical studies have been performed in the dog or cat. Fibre in the diet also reduces the bioavailability of all energy producing nutrients (i.e. fat, carbohydrate and protein) and so should probably be avoided in animals with compromised gastrointestinal function particularly those with malabsorption.

7.7 VITAMINS
Some authors consider that older animals should be provided with increased quantities of vitamins in the ration to overcome reduced ability to digest and/or absorb them from the ration though there is little evidence to support this viewpoint. Water soluble vitamins are lost from the body in the urine and polyuria such as accompanies chronic renal failure or diabetes are indications for increasing dietary intake to compensate for urinary losses. Vitamin intake should probably also be encouraged in the presence of reduced liver function.

7.8 MINERALS

Mike Davies

There is concem about the amounts of some minerals in rations fed to older animals, particularly:

Phosphorus Sodium Potassium Zinc Calcium

Phosphorus
It is known that phosphorus retention occurs frequently in animals with chronic renal failure. This can result in calcification of various tissues including the kidneys themselves. For this reason high dietary intake of phosphorus should be avoided in older animals. Controlling dietary phosphorus intake has been shown to delay the progression of renal failure in several studies (see Chapter 5 ).

Sodium
Many older dogs have endocardiosis which, even in compensated patients, results in sodium retention through activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. Also, hypertension is a common proin chronic renal failure in dogs and excess sodium load may make this worse. In humans clinically normal people with high salt intakes have higher blood pressure, and there is an age-related increase in blood pressure as well. Although primary hypertension is rare in cats and dogs some dogs are known to have salt-sensitive hypertension and recent studies at the Royal Veterinary College have demonstrated an increase in blood pressure with advancing age in cats and dogs (Bodey 1995 personal communication). In the presence of congestive heart failure sodium intake should be minimised to
Library of veterinary practice 134

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

decrease its effects on preload. While conventional treatof dogs with endocardiosis states that treatment is unnecessary until heart failure is decompensated the author considers early introduction of reduced sodium diets helpful, particularly as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is stimulated early in the disease and switching old dogs from a relatively high sodium content ration to a relatively low sodium content ration can be difficult in some individuals due to acquired taste preference for salt (see Chapter 2 ).

Potassium
Potassium is very important as the main intracellular electrolyte in the body and depleted concentrations lead to weakness and neuromuscular abnormalities. Severe potassium loss can occur in renal disease leading to clinical hypokalaemia, therefore care is needed to avoid a ration with low potassium in such cases.

Zinc
Some authors suggest that older dogs require an increased dietary supply of zinc, presumably due to decreased ability to digest/absorb it. In cancer patients supplementation with zinc can lead to improved appetite and enhanced immune response.

Calcium
High concentrations of calcium in a ration can reduce the bioavailability of other minerals such as copper, zinc and phosphorus so excessive dietary intake should be avoided particularly in rations containing relatively small amounts of trace elements, and in individuals with impaired gastrointestinal function such as malabsorption. High calcium intake can also stimulate hypercalcitoninism and suppress parathyroid hormone activity which may be significant and complicate the clinical picture in some cases. Excessive calcium intake should be avoided as this can encourage the development of nephrocalcinosis and other soft tissue calcification in at-risk individuals.

ANAESTHESIA AND SURGERY IN GERIATRIC PATIENTS
KEY POINTS
: (1) Advancing age is not in itself a contraindication to general anaesthesia or major surgery. (2) Preoperative screening of old patients for the presence of subdisease or impaired organ function is necessary before anaesthesia or surgery. (3) Anaesthetic doses should be based on lean body weight not actual body weight if the animal is obese. (4) Generally, anaesthetic and other drug doses need to be reduced in ageing patients. (5) Attempts must be made to avoid the development of hypothermia and hypotension during anaesthesia of old patients.

8.1 OBJECTIVES OF SURGERY IN OLD PATIENTS
The objective of performing surgery in geriatric patients is to prolong active, enjoyable life and procedures that offer no benefits to the patient should be avoided. However, a policy of avoiding all 'high risk' surgery would deny some patients with responsive conditions the benefits of surgical treatment. The decision to perform elective surgery on old patients has to be a clinical judgement following full discussion with the owner. Owners should be made aware that older patients generally need preoperative screening, take longer to recover, require more post-surgical nursing, and may need careful (sometimes expensive) monitoring. Ageing changes affecting the liver, kidneys, and the cardiovascular and respiratory systems are of major importance in anaesthesia. To maximise the benefits of any surgical procedure the physiological, pharmacological and pathological changes commonly seen in older animals need to be understood by both the surgeon and the anaesthetist. A substantial proportion of surgery is performed in older animals, for example for the removal of tumours, and advancing age is not in itself a contraindication to major surgery or to the administration of a general anaesthetic. However, it is important to assess the elderly patient fully before surgery because they frequently have multiple organ system disease necessitating modifications in technique. Postoperative support is also very important, and mortality and morbidity may be higher if pre- and post-surgical risk factors are not managed properly.

8.2 AGE-RELATED TISSUE CHANGES THAT MAY AFFECT ANAESTHESIA OR SURGERY
Age-related changes that may affect anaesthesia or surgery include: Nervous System Cardiovascular system

Respiratory system Renal

Mike Davies

Liver Endocrine Obesity

Nervous system Central nervous system
Reduced functional tissue in the CNS is probably one of the factors that reduces the anaesthetic dose needed in older patients. Old patients often have sluggish, impaired or absent reflex responses (e.g. pupillary light reflex) which may complicate monitoring during anaesthesia. Loss of function of the special senses such as sight and hearing may lead to apprehension in strange environments (especially in cats), and sometimes sedation is needed to reduce preoperative stress which otherwise can significantly increase sympathetic simulation. Geriatric animals have reduced ability to generate body temperature and are susceptible to develop hypothermia, particularly during prolonged surgery or the postoperative recovery period. In this context it is important to remember that core body temperature may differ from peripheral measurements, and the use of oesophageal thermometers or infra-red thermometers (applied in the aural canal) may be preferable to rectal temperature recording.

Peripheral nervous system
Supersensitivity of postsynaptic receptors may prolong the action of muscle relaxants.

Mike Davies

Interpretation of the significance of poor reflex responses during anaesthesia is more difficult in older patients than in the young.

Cardiovascular system
Subclinical and clinical cardiac disease is common in older dogs, and impaired cardiovascular function should be expected in elderly patients. Baroreceptor function may be impaired, particularly in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and the cardiovascular system's ability to compensate for surgical haemorrhage, or for the vasodilatory effects of anaesthetic agents may be inadequate resulting in severe hypotension. Existing cardiovascular conditions such as congestive heart failure, cor pulmonale, sick sinus syndrome and the cardiac signs associated with hyperthyroidism in cats should be stabilised before general anaesthesia. Anaesthetic agents depress cardiac function and cardiac arrest can be precipitated if cardiac arrhythmias are present, particularly ventricular arrhythmias that are refractory to therapy, right bundle branch block and bradycardia (heart rate below 60 in dogs; below 80 in cats). Monitoring heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures by direct or indirect methods is desirable throughout anaesthesia as is ECG recording, monitoring pulse character and regular examination of visible mucous membranes for capillary refill time.

Respiratory system
Age-related degenerative changes progressively decrease pulmonary function and physical changes occur in the lungs and chest wall. There is reduced alveolar surface area and diffusion capacity, pulmonary fibrosis, reduced lung elasticity, and reduced mechanical ventilation reserve. Chronic obstructive lung disease is common in old dogs and cats. All of these changes impair gaseous exchange during anaesthesia hence oxygen supplementation is beneficial, and in some cases the use of bronchodilators may

Canine and Feline Geriatrics
be indicated.

Mike Davies

Impaired laryngeal function (sometimes laryngeal paralysis in older dogs particularly Labrador retrievers) and increased respiratory dead space necessitate correct endotracheal intubation during anaesthesia and careful preparation of the patient to avoid vomiting. The use of antiemetic drugs (e.g. metoclopramide) might be indicated in patients requiring emergency surgical treatment, those with oesophageal or gastric motility problems or those with conditions likely to cause nausea (e.g. uraemia). A recent study suggests that older animals have a greater risk of developing gastro-oesophageal reflux during anaesthesia. Pulmonary embolism is a common postoperative complication in old people, and may be more common than is currently appreciated in veterinary patients. In human general surgery patients the incidence of deep vein thrombosis is reported to be as high as 45% in those aged over 40, and 65% in patients over 71 (Consensus Conference 1986; Borow and Goldson 1981).

Renal
Impaired renal function prolongs the plasma half-life of drugs eliminated via the kidney and may alter fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance, so screening for renal function is important before anaesthesia. It is good practice to administer a balanced solution intravenously before and during anaesthesia to facilitate control of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance and to maintain renal perfusion. If renal hypotension occurs during anaesthesia tubular ischaemia may result leading to acute tubular necrosis and renal failure. Advancing age and general anaesthesia are both important risk factors for the development of acute renal failure. Other risk factors include the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflamdrugs (NSAIDs), aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and other nephrotoxic drugs (Polzin 1991).

Liver

Mike Davies

Most liver function tests usually remain normal in geriatric patients and this probably reflects the huge reserve capacity of this organ, however, in humans bromsulphalein (BSP) retention does increase with age. Hepatic lipidosis is common in cats, and may or may not be associated with obesity. Up to 50% of liver biopsies taken from cats in the USA are reported to demonstrate lipidosis on histological examination (Davenport 1991 personal cornmunication). This condition can be secondary to diamellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism or protein-energy malnutrition and affected animals may show gross hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzyme concentrations (serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) and disturbances of liver function. Cirrhosis is a chronic progressive disease usually affecting older animals resulting in loss of parenchymal mass and therefore reduced function. Primary and secondary hepatic neoplasia may also occur, eventually causing reduced liver function. In the presence of impaired hepatic function the plasma clearance rate for drugs may be decreased resulting in increased duration of action. At the same time drugs and nutrients that need to be converted to an active form by the liver may exhibit reduced activity.

Endocrine Thyroid
Serum T4 concentrations decrease by approximately 0.07 µg/100 ml per year in dogs with advancing age (Belshaw and Rijnbeck, 1979; Weller et al. 1983). If this fall has a significant effect thermoregulatory problems (hypothermia), and cardiovascular disturbances such as bradycardia or impaired myocardial contractility might be expected to result. Older animals might also be expected to have a reduced metabolic rate and a predisposition to develop obesity, which they do.

Hypothyroidism is relatively common in older dogs and may be associated with concurrent obesity. In some of these animals anaesthesia will be complicated by both the hypothyroidism and hypoinsulinaemia or insulin resistance. Hypothyroid animals are more susceptible to develop hypothermia and the vasodilatory effects of agents such as acepromazine and halothane may induce profound hypotension.

Adrenal
Aldosterone responses decrease in humans with advancing age and these changes are thought to be secondary to reduced renin secretion from the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In view of the high incidence of renal pathology in old animals it is reasonable to assume that such a decline might also occur in animals. It has been suggested that corticosteroids should be administered to geriatric animals during prolonged periods of stress, surgery or anaesthesia to counter 'adrenal exhaustion'. Hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's syndrome) is most common in middle-aged to old dogs. It causes muscle weakness, reduced expiratory reserve volume, reduced chest wall compliance, increased blood volume and increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures (Feldman & Nelson 1987). Adrenaline concentrations may increase, particularly in the presence of major organ system failure such as congestive heart failure. Plasma nor-adrenaline concentrations increase with age due to reduced clearance, but receptors compensate by becoming less sensitive.

Pancreas
Glucose tolerance deteriorates with advancing age and may be associated with hypoinsulinaemia (diabetes mellitus) or the development of peripheral insulin resistance. The administration of fluids containing glucose needs to be carefully considered in such patients, particularly if nutritional support is going to be given by total parenteral nutrition (TPN) when 50% dextrose solutions may be advocated. Chronic diabetics may have abnormal serum electrolyte concentrations which

should be corrected before surgery.

Mike Davies

In the presence of hyperinsulinaemia, hypoglycaemia may be precipitated during general anaesthesia and, as even a transient hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage, blood (and in some cases urine) glucose concentrations should be monitored during anaesthesia.

Obesity
In dogs the incidence of obesity increases with age. Obesity can impair cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic and musculoskeletal function. Even in thin animals there is an increase in the body fat to lean body mass ratio with increasing age. When calculating the dose of an anaesthetic it is important to base it on the lean body weight - not on total body weight so some assessment of the degree of obesity is necessary. Large amounts of body fat alter drug pharmacokinetics. Anaesthetic agents (being fat soluble) are taken up into body fat stores during prolonged administration such as intravenous infusion or during inhalation maintenance ana~sthesia. These fat deposits act as a reservoir for the agent and prolong recovery time. The initial induction dose of short acting agents such as thiopentone sodium and methohexitone is not taken up into fat, but subsequent doses saturate skeletal muscle, and then are redistributed to fat. Repeated doses should be avoided in obese individuals. Prolonged administration of halothane delays recovery because it has a high blood/fat solubility coefficient. On the other hand isoflurane is relatively insoluble in blood and fat and is probably more appropriate for use in obese old patients. If the obesity is associated with hepatic lipidosis, drugs such as pentobarbitone which requires liver detoxification are probably best avoided. Obesity may confound the identification of anatomical landmarks for the administration of local anaesthetic agents and it also increases the surgical risk of wound dehiscence and postoperative wound infection. Large amounts of perithoracic and intrathoracic fat may restrict chest wall excursion, lung inflation and compromise cardiac function. Obesity sometimes occurs secondary to other conditions and this can present a

diagnostic challenge to the clinician. Whenever possible uncomplicated primary obesity should be corrected by dietary management before elective surgery and anaesthesia.

8.3 DRUG-ANAESTHETIC INTERACTION
Many old animals are kept on long-term treatments such as non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), corticosteroids, diuretics, cardiac stiulants and anticonvulsants. A pre-surgical review of medications is important because they may affect anaesthesia. Phenytoin and primidone are potentially hepatotoxic when they interwith anaesthetic agents and they also cause CNS depression, so reducing the dose of anaesthetic needed. Chronic glucocorticoid administration may induce adrenal insufficiency predisposing to cardiac instability during anaesthesia. This is another reason why glucocorticoid administration immediately before induction of anaesthesia has been advocated. Long-term diuretic administration may cause metabolic alkalosis, hypokalaemia, and sometimes hypomagnesaemia - all of which should be corrected before surgery.

It is important to review the presenting history in detail, perform a comphysical examination and perform laboratory screening tests of geriatric animals for signs of subclinical disease or impaired organ function. The author advocates the following as a minimum pre-surgery screening programme for geriatric patients: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) complete blood count and differential haematocrit total serum protein serum urea serum creatinine
Library of veterinary practice 145

Canine and Feline Geriatrics
(6) serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chlorine and calcium) (7) blood glucose (8) serum bile acids (9) ECG examination (10) urinalysis - protein, pH, glucose and sediment.

Mike Davies

In an ideal situation the following would also be included in a geriatric screen: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) T4 serum ALT, AP survey chest and abdominal radiographs arterial and venous blood gas analysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurement.

It is important to review recent medications and existing diagnostic information such as previous radiographs, or laboratory data.

8.5 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA
Local or regional anaesthesia may be safer than general anaesthesia in severely debilitated animals. Sedation is usually required, and perineural injection, field block, surface analgesia, intravenous regional analgesia or epidural and spinal injections can be used. Identification of anatomical landmarks may be difficult in obese subjects. Epidural anaesthesia is a useful procedure when the anaesthetic is injected at the lumbosacral junction but cranial epidural should be avoided because sympathetic fibres may be blocked causing hypotension. Acupuncture has been recommended as a method of providing analgesia for minor procedures in 'high risk' geriatric veterinary patients (Janssens et al. 1988).

8.6 GENERAL ANAESTHESIA Preparation
Animals should be fasted for 12 hours, with water being withdrawn 1-2 hours beforehand. Water deprivation in old animals can precipitate a uraemic crisis so overnight deprivation is not recommended if there is evidence of renal incompetence and an i.v. fluid line should be established before the administration of a sedative or anaesthetic. All patients should be weighed before computation of drug dosages to avoid errors. If the animal is obese the lean body weight should be estimated.

Premedication
Acepromazine can be given in low doses (0.02-0.05 mg/kg i.m.) but should not be used in the presence of cardiovascular disease such as endocardiosis and congestive heart failure, as it can cause rapid hypotension. Acepromazine should also be avoided in dogs prone to seizures, and it is contraindicated in the presence of renal impairment. Intravenous administration can cause profound hypotension and it should only be used by this route with great care. The author has witnessed a geriatric dog collapsing and dying immediately following the intravenous administration of acepromazine. Xylazine and medetomidine should only be used with extreme care in geriatric canine and feline patients because they can cause deep and prolonged sedation with bradycardia and severe cardiovascular depression. Vomiting often follows their administration and this could result in aspiration in old animals with impaired laryngeal reflexes. Caution is needed when using these substances in the presence of pulmonary disease. In dogs neuroleptanalgesics have the advantage that the narcotic component can
Library of veterinary practice 147

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

be reversed by an antagonist. However they have proeffects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems causing tachycardia or bradycardia, hypertension or hypotension, depressed respiration and cyanosis. After reversal some dogs relapse into a sedated state that may last for up to 36 hours. These agents are contraindicated in the presence of impaired hepatic or renal function, should only be used at reduced dose rates (50% that recommended for adults) and with great care in elderly patients. When using narcotic analgesics or neuroleptanalgesics dogs should be premeditated with anticholinergics to avoid secondary bradycardia.

Induction
Inhalation can be used, but may induce excitation if the animal is not sedated and the associated catecholamine release can cause cardiac disturbances. Isoflurane has advantages over halothane because it is relatively insoluble in blood, causes rapid induction and does not potentiate the effects of adrenaline on the heart. Some old animals, particularly those with catabolic diseases such as chronic heart failure, hyperthyroidism, sepsis and cancer may have a fall in body fat content with a concurrent decrease in body muscle mass and these changes can influence the distribution of i.v. anaesthetic agents increasing their efficacy and prolonging their duration of action. Reduced hepatic function may also prolong their duration of action and delay recovery. In general, intravenous anaesthetic doses should be reduced in elderly patients. Older animals should be given only 50% of the dose of thiopentone sodium required by young adults, i.e. give 2-3 mg/kg i.v. over 10 seconds followed by small incremental doses given to effect over about 1 minute. A 2.5% solution is suitable for healthy, large dogs, but a 1.25% solution is recommended for cats, small dogs and debilitated cases. Give just sufficient to induce narcosis then mask/intubate. Premedication may be needed to reduce excitation during induction and recovery. Thiopentone is not good for anaesthetic maintenance because of tissue saturation and the prolonged recovery period that results. Concurrent administration of chloramphenicol, streptomycin or kanamycin can also prolong the recovery period. Greyhounds and other dogs with little body fat may take 24 hours to recover from the effects of thiopentone, and methohexitone or propofol may be more
Library of veterinary practice 148

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

appropriate. Methohexitone is shorter acting and the recovery period less than with thiopentone but it needs to be used with care as it can cause severe respiratory depression if administered too rapidly, and greater excitement or inadequate relaxation if administered too slowly. Propofol has an action similar to thiopentone and it has the advantage that it can be used without premedication, but it does cause slightly greater cardiovascular depression. It has a less cumulative effect than thiopentone resulting in a more rapid recovery. Pentobarbitone is rarely used in clinical practice nowadays. It is metabolised slowly and may cause profound respiratory depression. It is contraindicated in the presence of hepatic impairment and recovery time is prolonged with hypothermia being a postoperative complication. Alphadolone and alphaxalone combination is commonly used to provide anaesthesia in cats. Some cats may develop respiratory embarrassment following rapid induction and the presence of underlying lung pathology may predispose to this. Slow administration of the anaesthetic is recommended to minimise the occurrence of such incidents. Ketamine can be used as a sole anaesthetic in the cat, but in dogs it should only be used following premedication with xylazine. When used by itself muscle relaxation is poor, necessitating the administration of xylazine or a benzodiazepine such as diazepam. In cats vomiting often occurs during induction, and recovery from ketamine/xylazine anaesthesia can be prolonged for up to 8 hours in the presence of hypothermia. Xylazine also induces bradycardia and the administration of atropine immediately after the xylazine injection is recommended to counter this effect. Induction with ketamine following premedication with acepromazine and subsequent maintenance with halothane or nitrous oxide alone or in combination has been recommended for cats with hyperthyroidism (Thoday 1990). Respiratory depression is a consequence of all forms of anaesthesia and preoxygenation for 2-3 minutes before and during induction will help to prevent hypoxaemia. The animal should be fully intubated following induction, to avoid excessive dead space.

Maintenance
Inhalation anaesthetics are preferred to intravenous drugs for maintenance anaesthesia in geriatric patients because most of the agent is excreted unchanged via the lungs and recovery is not dependent upon drug metabolism. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (ventilator or manual) has advantages during prolonged surgery in the elderly to facilitate the maintenance of blood gases within normal limits. It also saves the patient's body 'work', and offers a method for hastening the removal of anaesthetic agent in the presence of an overdose. All general anaesthetics cause respiratory depression, and some impairment of respiratory function is likely to be present in this group of patients so oxygen flow rate should be maintained at 30-33% of inspired gas. The most commonly used inhalation agents in small animal practice (halothane and isoflurane) can rapidly cause severe cardiovascular and respiratory depression if high concentrations are given. For this reason they should only be used with vaporizers specifically designed to be used with them. Isoflurane is preferred to halothane in old patients, because it does not potentiate the cardiovascular effects of catecholamines, cardiac output is well maintained at anaesthetic doses and it does not alter myocardial contractility, however it does cause a fall in total peripheral resiswhich can precipitate hypotension. Recovery is prolonged with methoxyflurane, and it is contraindicated in the presence of renal or hepatic impairment. Nitrous oxide does not alter blood pressure by itself and helps reduce the dose of other inhalation agents. It should be avoided in patients with severe respiratory problems preoperatively, or if hypoxaemia develops during surgery. If muscle relaxation is needed during surgery administration of a muscle relaxant is preferred to increasing the depth of anaesthesia. Non-depolarising relaxants must be reversed by an anticholinesterase so atropine is given first to block the unwanted muscarinic effects (such as bradycardia) of the reversal agent. Pancuronium is a medium-duration relaxant (lasting 30-45 minutes). It may cause tachycardia in cats and dogs and is contraindicated in the presence of hepatic or renal impairment and obesity. Vecuronium causes minimal cardiovascular effects
Library of veterinary practice 150

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

and has a duration of action of about 30 minutes. Atracurium has a similar duration of action, also has minimal vagolytic or sympatholytic properties and it can be administered to animals with hepatic or renal failure. Depolarising muscle relaxants are easier to use as they don't need to be reversed. In dogs suxamethonium at a dose rate of 0.3 mg/kg given intravenously will provide complete paralysis for 20 minutes. Supplements of 0.1 mg/kg can be given to prolong its effects. It is contra-indicated in the presence of hepatic impairment. In cats 1.5 mg/kg produces paralysis for 5 minutes.

Supportive therapy
Intravenous fluids should be administered throughout anaesthesia at a rate of 10 mI/kg per hour. The rate should be reduced in animals with congestive heart failure or anuric renal failure, and monitoring central venous pressure is advisable. Urine output should be maintained at more than 0.3 ml/kg per hour in the dog. The need for nutritional support of patients with catabolic disease is becoming increasingly important. Anorectic animals or those with recognised catabolic disease such as congestive heart failure or cancer, should be provided with adequate nutrition before elective surgery either by force feeding or tube feeding. Nasogastric tubes (Fr6) can be passed easily in conscious dogs and cats, and they offer a simple, effective way of providing nourishment to geriatric patients. In some cases postoperative malnutrition can be predicted, and early placement of nasogastric (or naso-oesophageal), pharyngostomy, gastorstomy or jejunostomy tubes is advantageous. Diets for tube feeding should be high in energy density, provide adequate nitrogen in the form of protein, and be administered in a liquid formulation to facilitate passage down the tube. Use of a heated pad, circulating hot water blanket or insulated blankets help minimise heat loss and prevent the development of hypothermia during anaesthesia. A fall in body temperature can greatly prolong the recovery period.

Monitoring

Mike Davies

Throughout anaesthesia it has been recommended that the following parameters should be monitored (Dodman et al. 1984): (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) heart rate and rhythm respiratory rate and character pulse rate and quality mucous membrane colour capillary filling rate ECG rectal temperature.

In some cases the following should also be monitored: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) arterial blood pressure (direct or indirect) urinary output haematocrit total serum protein blood gases.

Recovery
During recovery the environmental temperature should be kept warm, and fluid therapy and oxygen administration should be continued until the animal is conscious. Endotracheal tubes should only be removed once laryngeal reflexes have returned. Antiemetic drugs may be indicated in patients exhibiting nausea or retching.

8.7 SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS

Mike Davies

With increasing age skin loses its elasticity and vascularity making it vulnerable to trauma and it bruises easily. Gentle handling during surgery is therefore advisable. Wound healing may be delayed in older patients, and there may be a reduction or delayed response in the formation of granulation tissue. Wounds in older patients may also be more susceptible to infection and patients with evidence of systemic infection, renal disease, hepatic disease, cardiovascular disease or endocrine disorders are likely to exhibit delayed wound healing. Hypoproteinaemia will adversely affect wound healing by impairing fibroplasia, neovascularisation, remodelling and tensile strength so prolonging the healing phase. Maintaining a positive protein-energy balin patients before elective surgery and during the postoperative recovery period is an important therapeutic objective which might necessitate special feeding techniques in some individuals. Haemostasis needs to be vigilant during surgery because local blood losses may seem small if the patient has transient hypotension but could result in significant postoperative haemorrhage following recovery. Haemorrhage at wound sites is a major risk factor for the development of infection or dehiscence. Advancing age, prolonged anaesthesia and surgery time, hypotension, obesity, some therapeutic agents and the presence of concurrent disease may all increase the risk of wound infection. The presence of gross obesity may delay return to normal mobility.

9.1 INTRODUCTION

Mike Davies

Radiology is an important aid to diagnosis in geriatric patients. It can help in the early detection of problerns before clinical signs are evident and it can help in devising a plan for the management of a case. For example, all animals with neoplasia should be radiographed for evidence of secondary spread to the lungs or other vital structures before surgical attempts at removal. Care is needed not to overinterpret radiographic findings for example it is dangerous to consider intrathoracic masses as being secondary metastases simply because a previous neoplasm was removed at an earlier date. The ability of older animals to mask the effects of subclinical disease processes in major organ systems by compensatory physiological mechanisms that maintain homeostasis makes diagnosis and evaluation of such individuals a challenge. Evaluation of the whole animal is particularly important before an elective stressful procedure such as a surgical procedure under general anaesthesia. Ageing changes occur in various organs and can present as unusual radiographic appearances to unsuspecting clinicians.

9.2 SKELETAL CHANGES
Ossification of the costochondral junctions gives an irregular radiodense pattem which may be mistaken for neoplasia or osteomyelitis. Spondylosis is benign new bone development bridging adjacent vertebrae in the spine and it is particularly common in some breeds such as brachycephalics. The new bone deposition is usually smooth and of little consequence unless it entraps spinal nerves as they leave the spinal column. Spondylosis is particularly common at the lumbosacral junction and at this site a single lesion needs to be differentiated from diswhich may also occur in older animals. In the latter cases there are clinical signs of pain, pyrexia and sometimes neurological deficits and on radiography there is usually narrowing of the joint space, loss of bone in adjacent vertebral endplates, and sclerosis either side of the joint space as well as ventral (and lateral on dorsoventral projections) new bone bridging between the vertebrae. Demineralisation of bone occurs in renal secondary hyperparathyroidism often before owners report the clinical signs such as polydipsia and polyuria associated with the underlying renal disease. Poorly mineralised bones with thin cortices are seen on survey radiographs, and the mandible is one of the first bones to be affected with teeth on radiographs of affected animals appearing to float' in the poorly radiodense bone.
Library of veterinary practice 156

Chronic, smooth spurs of new bone and smooth surfaced osteophytes may develop around joints (particularly on the distal femur and proximal tibia of the stifle, and at the interphalangeal joints) and they may be of no clinical significance. They need to be differentiated from the more aggressive new bone deposition associated with degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis. It is useful to radiograph the contralateral joint to compare unusual benign appearances on radiographs. If the radiographic appearance is the same in both limbs it is unlikely to be directly related to unilateral clinical signs such as lameness.

9.3 SOFT TISSUE CHANGES
Survey radiographs can give a good indication of the nutritional status of an animal. Lack of fat over the dorsal spinous processes of the spine, and poor soft tissue detail (due to lack of mesenteric fat) on lateral abdominal radiographs both may indicate poor body condition. Large deposits of fat over the spine, in the region of the falciform ligament in the cranioventral abdomen or around the apex of the heart may all suggest the presence of overnutrition or obesity. Soft tissue organs should be examined on survey radiographs for changes in shape, contour, size, position or radiodensity. In ageing animals several changes are commonly seen on survey radiographs which may have little or no clinical significance: (1) In the chest cardiac enlargement (left sided, right sided or both) may occur in dogs in the absence of any clinical signs but associated with compensatory mechanisms such as in response to the leaking atrioventricular valves which occurs in endocardiosis. Many older dogs (particularly the brachycephalic breeds) develop a pronounced bronchial pattem (doughnuts and tramlines) on lateral radiographs of the chest due to thickening and calcification of the bronchial walls. These changes may or may not be associated with respiratory signs such as abnormal respiratory sounds on auscultation. In the abdomen hepatic enlargement is frequently noticed in both cats and dogs with the left hepatic lobe extending well beyond the costal arch on lateral views of the abdomen. Occasionally the liver size is reduced on survey radiographs, sometimes with cranial displacement of the axis of the stomach even though routine biochemistry tests for liver damage are normal. Kidney size may be reduced in the presence of progressive renal dissuch as chronic interstitial nephritis in cats and increased in cases of renal hypertrophy or neoplasia, and the renal contour may be irregular due to fibrosis or the presence of neoplasia

such as lymphosarcoma (which is also common in cats). Dystrophic calcification can occur in many soft tissues notably the kidneys (where it usually occurs at the junction between the cortex and medulla), heart wall, urinary bladder, prostate, tendons and skin. In tendons the likely cause is chronic inflammation due to repeated trauma. However, in all such cases a primary underlying cause such as hypercalcaemia due to paraneoplastic syndrome, or Cushing's syndrome should be sought. Animals with Cushing's syndrome (hyperadrenocorticism) and other conditions may develop calcification of the skin which, when overlying other structures, may confuse unsuspecting clinicians trying to interpret radiographs.

Interpretation of the significance of radiographic signs can be difficult in older animals. It is helpful if comparisons can be made with survey radiographs taken earlier in life to determine significant changes and, if sequential films are available, they will give an idea of the timescale of progression of a lesion. This type of information can be very helpful with the development of subtle changes in, for example, the lungs. If it were not for the potential health hazards associated with obtaining good radiographic images, and for the need to administer a general anaesthetic to most animals to get them, a good case could be put for obtaining screening films at various stages of an animal's life. In future the use of safe, noninvasive imaging techniques such as ultrasound will undoubtedly add a new dimension to our ability to detect early changes in organs through routine screening examinations.

10.1 WHY SCREEN GERIATRIC PATIENTS?

Mike Davies

Over one-third of cats and dogs presented to veterinary practices are aged 7 years or over (SAPTU, demographic data supplied by the Small Animal Practice Teaching Unit, University of Edinburgh, August 1991) and there is a great deal of interest in this group of animals because of:

(1) the effect of ageing on major body system function (2) the likelihood of the occurrence of subclinical disease.

Early detection of problems and routine screening for the presence of subclinical diseases or reduced organ function are important clinical objectives in the management of older animals. Performance of a full physical examination and blood and urine tests at regular intervals is useful because it helps to:

(1) detect problems early to increase the chance of successful intervention to delay or prevent the onset and/or progression of disease (2) provide base normals' for the individual against which future meacan be compared; (3) demonstrates a caring attitude towards the patient and helps to move the practice away from providing a fire brigade service (only providing treatment at times of illness) to one of providing a comprehensive preventative medicine programme.

Health screening of older patients is important particularly before the administration of a general anaesthetic, the use of a therapeutic agent with narrow margins of safety, or the administration of drugs that require normal hepatic, renal or cardiac function. Modification of drug dosage may be necessary in patients with impaired organ function with or without evidence of subclinical disease. An annual vaccination programme provides the opportunity to perform a full physical examination and would be an ideal time to recommend further screening tests although for some animals, particularly those that have a medical history of serious illness, checks should probably be more frequent - say every 6 months. Unfortunately with many owners their compliance with an annual vaccination programme deteriorates with time. Some practices prefer to offer a geriatric screening programme sepafrom the usual routine vaccination/worming and flea control consultantions and this may have
Library of veterinary practice 160

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

merit in that it allows the programme to be offered as a 'special' service. My personal experience of running a geriatric clinic is that some owners will gladly pay for screening tests whereas others will not. Some practices claim that the best results may be obtained by offering the initial consultation free of charge as a 'lost-leader' with the costs of providing the service being borne by the follow-up work (e.g. dental work, or the implementation of a dietary programme) that is often generated as a direct result of the screening programme. As a student I was taught to perform laboratory and other investigative tests only when they were indicated from the history and physical examination. However, my personal experience since graduation has been that serious conditions may be missed by selectively omitting tests from a screening profile, and I now prefer to perform a complete screen whenever possible (see Table 10.1). Fortunately technological advances have resulted in a significant decrease in the cost of laboratory testing, and sometimes it is actually cheaper to perform a full profile screen than to request a few specific tests. In my opinion it is good practice to include a wide range of tests in a routine screening programme. Radiography is an important aid to diagnosis in geriatric animals (see Chapter 9) but the potential health hazards and the need to administer a general anaesthetic to most animals preclude it from being included in a routine geriatric screening programme unless it is indicated by the presence of a clinical problem. In the future survey ultrasonography may be useful in a geriatric screening programme.

10.2 HISTORY
A full clinical history should be obtained from the previous medical records and the owner. It is important to ascertain whether the presenting signs are sudden in onset, a predictable sequel to a problem earlier in life or the manifestation of an insidious, chronic disease process. Older animals frequently have a complex history and inexperienced clinicians often find it difficult to assess the significance of specific findings from the history in relation to current presenting signs. The temptation is to assume that clinical signs associated with a single organ system must be related, when in fact they usually are not. It is important that the previous medical record is examined in some detail in case there is a trend to
Library of veterinary practice 161

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

suggest an on-going chronic disease process, and this is facilitated by the use of:

(1) a comprehensive recording system for clinical information (2) standardisation of clinical record keeping by clinical members of staff (3) the use of computers to store clinical records - because the records are less likely to be lost or damaged and are easy to retrieve in chronorder and in a standard format.

Owners may have difficulty in recalling the full history of geriatric patients, and often they are not as forthcoming about signs of illness which they consider to be 'normal' for an old animal. A decreasing response to visual stimuli is commonly reported and yet poor vision may be caused by a plethora of disease processes and is not necessarily just part of the ageing process.

10.3 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Many older animals will have concomitant disease and so it is important to perform a full clinical examination and not just focus on the problem(s) raised by the animal owner. In particular evidence should be sought for the presence of cardiac, respiratory, hepatic or renal dysfunction which are all common in advancing age, and for external evidence of internal disease. Dermatologists frequenfly refer to the skin as an indicator of general health and this can certainly be true in older animals (see Table 10.2). Greying of the hair - particularly around the face and muzzle is common with advancing age. Neoplasia of the skin is also common in older animals (see Chapter 6). A full neurological examination is necessary to identify signs of primary or secondary neurological deficit or increased neurological responsiveness. Both the peripheral and central nervous systems should be examined. See Chapter 3 and Wheeler (1989) for further details. Ophthalmoscopic examination may reveal evidence of increased tortuosity of retinal blood vessels or even of subclinical retinal haemorrhages typical of hypertensive patients. Sudden onset blindness due to retinal detachment (often

bilateral) is a more severe manifestation of hypertenand is seen in the presence of renal failure. Blood and urinalysis should form part of a comprehensive screening programme because quite simple and inexpensive tests can provide invaluable information to assist the clinician. However there are many pitfalls in taking laboratory samples and in interpreting laboratory results and the reader is advised to consult an authoritative text on the subject such as that by Bush (1991).

10.4 HAEMATOLOGY
The purpose of conducting a haematological screen is to identify abnorparameters such as packed cell volume (PCV) or haemoglobin conincreased or reduced red or white cell numbers, altered red or white blood cell morphology, or an abnormal platelet count that may indicate the presence of disorders such as:

(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)

anaemia dehydration myeloproliferative disorders immunosuppression infection.

Packed cell volume (PCV, haematocrit index)
Cat Dog Normal range: 0.30-0.45 l/l (30-45%) Normal range: 0.37-0.66 l/l (48-66%)

A low PCV indicates the presence of anaemia with consequential reducin oxygen carrying capacity in the blood - which may be particularly harmful in older animals in which tissues may be particularly sensitive to local hypoxia. A high PCV usually indicates the presence of dehydration. Many authors consider that older animals are in a state of relative dehydration -and this is certainly likely in the presence of polyuric syndromes such as diabetes, renal failure and hyperadrenocorticism.

Red blood cell count
Cat Dog Normal range: 5-10 x 1012/1 Normal range: 5.5-9.5 x 1012/l

Low red blood cell (erythrocyte) numbers usually indicates the presence of anaemia. High red cell counts usually indicate the presence of dehydration - and only occasionally true polycythaemia.

Haemoglobin
Cat Dog Normal range: 8-15 g/dl Normal range: 12-23 g/dl

High haemoglobin concentrations usually indicate the presence of dehyand occasionally polycythaemia~ Low haemoglobin concentrations usually indicate the presence of anaemia.

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
Cat Dog Normal range: 39-55 fl Normal range: 60-77 fl

High MCV values may be caused by abnormally large, immature eryand is seen in regenerative anaemia (see below), myeloprolidisorders, and rarely in macrocytic anaemia. About 50% of cats with hyperthyroidism may have a high MCV. Low MCV values are seen when red cell size is small such as is caused by chronic haemorrhage and occasionally iron deficiency or feline haemo

Mike Davies

Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MVHC)
Cat Dog Normal range: 30-36 g/dl Normal range: 32-36 g/dl

Low MCHC values are seen with hypochromic cells (due to iron deficiency secondary to chronic inflammatory disease, chronic infection and neo-plasia), and in regenerative anaemia. Protein-losing conditions may also lead to protein deficiency and low MCHC values.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
Has to be corrected according to PCV measurement (see Bush 1991) Cat Dog Normal range: 0-12 mm/h Normal range: 0-5 mm/h

A high ESRr is seen in acute generalised infections (e.g. endocarditid), inflammatory diseases (e.g. peritonitis, pericarditis and pleuritis), rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pyometra, malignant neoplasia, renal failure, hypoproteinaemia, hypothryroidism, hyperadrenocorticism. A low ESR (negative after correction for PCV) is seen in haemolytic anaemia. Many of the red cell abnormalities reported will indicate the presence of anaemia and it is important to attempt to interpret the results accuractely (Table 10.3)

Regenerative anaemia (responsive as evidencied by the production of reticulocyts which are released into circulation) occurss after haemorrhage or haemolysis. Nonregenerative anaemia is commonly associated with thrombocytopenia and myeloproliferative disease (Table 10.4)

Platlet Count

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

Animals with obvious clinical signs of haemorrhage or with a regenerative anaemia on routine screening should have their platelet count monitored. However it is a useful examination to include in a routine screen because of the number of chronic, subclinical conditions which can affect circuplatelets. A reduced number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) occurs due to decreased production, increased destruction or loss from the body circuand is seen in bone marrow disease, uraemia, toxaemia, infection, hypoadrenocortidsm, DIC, immunemediated disorders, myeloproliferadisorders, haemorrhage and splenomegaly. An increased number of platelets (thrombocytosis) occurs due to excessive production rate or decreased removal from the circulation and is seen in postsplenectomy, in acute or chronic infections, inflammatory disease, drug induced, some myeloproliferative disorders (most cause thrombocytopenia) or malignant neoplasia.

10.5 BLOOD CHEMISTRY

Blood chemistry tests are an important part of a screening programme in older animals because they are particularly helpful in the detection of subclinical organ damage or functional failure.

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)

Plasma creatinine
Urea: creatinine ratio

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
Library of veterinary practice 166

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

Creatine kinase (CK)

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
Elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations may be caused by many different things including pre-renal and post-renal factors and should not be considered diagnostic of primary renal disease in all cases. Addiblood biochemistry and urinalysis are necessary to evaluate fully the cause of high BUN concentrations. To eliminate dietary factors BUN should be performed on blood collected after 12 hours starvation.

Cat Dog

Normal Range: 5-11 mmol/l Normal range: 2.5-7 mmol/l

In old animals undergoing routine screening a high BUN may indicate the presence of:

Pre-renal causes
• • • • • • •

dehydration increased catabolism hyperthyroidism intestinal haemorrhage necrosis hypoadrenocorticism hypoalbuminaemia.

Renal
• • •

chronic renal failure or other renal disease nephrocalcinosis neoplasia.

Library of veterinary practice

167

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

Post-renal
• • •

calculi neoplasia prostatic disease.

Cats are obligate carnivores and have liver enzyme systems for protein metabolism which do not down-regulate in the presence of reduced prointake in the diet. As a consequence of this, and of the large number of clinical conditions that can lead to catabolism, a high BUN, muscle wastage and weight loss are common features in old cats. In fact, almost any major organ system disorder is accompanied by severe catabolism and loss of lean body mass in the cat. Low BUN concentrations are seen in animals on low protein rations or in the presence of liver failure or acquired portosystemic shunts.

Plasma creatinine
Cat Dog Normal range: 40-130 mmol/l Normal range: 40-130 mmol/l

Unlike BUN, plasma creatinine concentrations are unaffected by other systemic factors and because it is exclusively excreted via the kidneys high concentrations indicate reduced renal function whatever the primary cause. Creatinine is therefore a more useful test for renal function than BUN.

Urea: creatinine ratio
The normal ratio of plasma urea to creatinine is 0.08 or less. Some authors have suggested that this ratio can be used to predict the rate of progression of renal failure.
Library of veterinary practice 168

Canine and Feline Geriatrics

Mike Davies

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
Hepatocyte damage releases the enzyme ALT and high concentrations are therefore indicative of active liver cell damage - whatever the primary cause. It is not a test that measures liver function, as only a small area of liver may be damaged to get significant increases in ALT - usually within 4-5 days. Even very high ALT concentrations can be followed by complete recovery by the liver. Myocarditis can also result in an increase in ALT, but this is uncommon.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
Alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes have been identified from various organs including the liver, bone, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney, and there is a specific isoenzyme produced in response to steroids in dogs. Increased ALP concentrations are usually associated with liver (particularly bile outflow obstruction) or bone disease (particularly tumours with new bone production as well as destruction or renal hyperparathyroidism) ALP concentrations are increased in 90% of feline hyperthyroid cases.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
Occurs in skeletal and cardiac muscle and in liver. It is most helpful in identifying muscle damage (with creatine kinase) particularly myositis, and occasionally for cardiomyopathies.

Creatine kinase (CK)
Creatine kinase isoenzymes occur in skeletal and cardiac muscle and in the brain. It is most useful as an indicator of muscle damage.

It has been reported that old animals have lower concentrations.

10.6 URINALYSIS
Specific gravity pH Urine protein Glucose Crystalluria

Specific gravity
The single most important screening test for renal insufficiency is urine specific gravity, which can be measured using an hydrometer or refractometer. The latter are in common use and give reliable results.

Cat Dog

Normal range: 1.03-1.060 Normal range: 1.015-1.045

A pale coloured urine with a low specific gravity indicates increased water excretion (polyuria) and is seen in many of the clinical conditions which are common in older cats and dogs, e.g. renal failure, diabetes, hyperadrenocorticism (dogs), canine pyometra, hypercalcaemia, and liver disease. A high urine specific gravity indicates urine concentration and may be caused by decreased renal perfusion as in shock, dehydration or cardiac disease.

Canine and Feline Geriatrics
pH

Mike Davies

The acidity or alkalinity of urine is usually measured in dog and cat urine by using test strips but more accurate results can be obtained by using a pH meter. The normal range for the dog and cat is 5.5-7. Urine pH is diet sensitive, with high protein rations causing an acidic urine. In the post-prandial period following a meal there is an alkaline tide during which the pH becomes less acidic. Table 10.6 lists the causes of abnormal urine pH.

Urine protein
Most proteins are usually retained in the circulation and are not filtered through the glomerulus into the urine, however in dog urine concentraof protein of 0.5 gA are normal. Most of this protein (which is mainly albumin) originates from the kidney itself and the lower urinary tract and has not been filtered through the glomeruli. Care is needed in interpreting protein concentrations in urine because this can be affected by the dilution effects of polyuria. Test strips are commonly used in veterinary practice and these are more sensitive to albumin than to other proteins. A more useful measure is 24-hour urinary protein loss but this requires collection of all voided urine over a 24 hour period which is not practical without access to a metabolism cage. Normal urine protein loss can be up to 30 mg/kg body weight per day. Excessive concentrations of protein in urine (above 10 g/l) are the result of renal disease (various types - but mainly chronic renal failure or glomerular disease), inflammatory disease, hyperproteinaemia (renal threshold is 100 g/l plasma protein), haemorrhage, haemaglobinaemia or myoglobinaemia.

Glucose
Glucosuria is usually associated with diabetes mellitus, but is also seen in hyperadrenocorticism, hyperthyroidism, chronic liver disease, renal failure, feline lower urinary tract disease and phaechromocytoma.
Library of veterinary practice 171

Crystalluria
Examination of urine sediment (in a fresh sample) can be very useful to detect abnormal cells (e.g. blood ceils, cancer cells) and crystals. If possible the urine should be fresh as crystals precipitate out as urine cools and other changes occur with changes in acidity or alkalinity. Struvite, oxalate, urate and cystine crystals may be associated with urolithiasis and sometimes with primary or secondary urinary tract infection. Ammonium urate crystalluria occurs with liver disease and portocaval shunts. Calcium containing crystals may increase in the presence of hyperparathyroidism.

El entrenamiento de un Teckel

No voy a engañarte, querido lector. El entrenamiento de un Teckel es largo. No importa la cantidad de cursos de los que hayas oído hablar, toda la gente que te dice que “tu perro puede ser educado completamente en unas semanas”. Esta información es falsa, y te diré por qué: porque un perro nunca, jamás, deja de aprender. Es algo que la mayoría de las personas no saben, o simplemente no creen, pero te lo aseguro…El aprendizaje dura toda la vida para nuestros amigos caninos. Un anciano de catorce años aún es capaz de aprender trucos y nuevas conductas, si se dan las circunstancias adecuadas. Es por eso que el entrenamiento de un Teckel es largo…Pero eso no significa, de ninguna de las maneras, que sea difícil o laborioso. Sí, desde luego, puedes enseñarle “ciertas cosas” en “cierto tiempo”, si sabes cómo hacerlo. Eso no lo niego en absoluto. El Teckel aprende muy deprisa, no importa la edad que tengan, si se les enseña adecuadamente. Ahora puedes enseñarle a tu perro, por ejemplo, a no saltar sobre las visitas. Pero si dentro de un año se le anima a saltar otra vez, entonces borrará lo anterior y tomará esta nueva conducta, creyendo que es la correcta. A esto es a lo que me refiero al decir que el entrenamiento de un perro dura toda la vida. Para ser educado, un perro necesita rutina y unas bases de conducta muy claras. Cuando le enseñes que algo es así, no puede cambiar con el tiempo. Debes estar muy seguro de lo que le enseñas: la orden que uses para que te dé la patita, el nombre al que deba responder, o si puede o no puede subirse a tu cama. Todo debe estar perfectamente claro, porque si dentro de un tiempo, aunque sea por error, algo cambia, también lo hará la conducta de tu perro. Porque seguirá aprendiendo lo que le enseñes, a sabiendas o no.

El entrenamiento de un Teckel es, por tanto, largo…Pero también inmensamente satisfactorio. Porque precisamente por ser largo, por durar toda la vida de tu amigo canino, siempre puedes enseñarle cosas nuevas, y lo que es más importante, puedes enseñárselas tú mismo.

Capítulo 1

Trabajo preliminar
es un término que a menudo se malinterpreta en entrenamiento canino, considerándose que sugiere la imposición de un control dominante sobre nuestro perro. Pero dejemos de lado la palabra y aceptemos que la obediencia básica es el trabajo preliminar a partir del cual se consigue una buena convivencia entre perro y propietario. Si el perro obedece a las órdenes siéntate, échate, ven y quieto, ello significa que es un animal civilizado y bien educado. Estas órdenes también son necesarias en la mayoría de trucos de este libro, y el tiempo que invierta hoy en enseñárselas servirá para reducir frustraciones en el futuro.
“Si mi perro ya sabe las órdenes del trabajo preliminar, ¿por qué tengo que seguir practicándolas?” Tenga en cuenta lo siguiente: los pianistas profesionales realizan calentamiento tocando escalas, los gimnastas olímpicos practican volteretas, el profesor revisa la lección y el deportista de la NBA trabaja los tiros libres. El entrenamiento de obediencia tiene por objetivo algo más que enseñar a su perro a responder a unas órdenes. Se trata de un ejercicio mental y de una rutina cómoda que le permitirán volver a conectar con su perro. Practicar estas aptitudes familiares dará a su perro la confianza para aprender otras nuevas.

Los favoritos de siempre

dar la pata, ladrar, y hacerse el muerto… estos trucos útiles, inútiles y siempre encantadores han estado ahí desde que los hombres de las cavernas compartieron por primera vez sus huesos con los lobos. Aunque un perro no tenga apellidos tras el nombre, si se echa al suelo al recibir la orden “bang” u ofrece educadamente su pata a un invitado, ¡será el mejor de todos entre sus amigos! Todo el mundo espera que un perro conozca estos trucos, y es cosa del propietario, y posiblemente incluso su deber, enseñarlos a su inteligente mascota.
Los trucos de este capítulo han resistido el paso del tiempo por una razón: son fáciles de enseñar y de aprender. Sacan provecho del comportamiento natural del perro asociando acciones familiares con pistas verbales. ¿Tiene un perro ruidoso? Debería ser sencillo obtener un ladrido, asociarlo a una orden y premiarlo. Los cobradores traerán cosas sin duda alguna antes de dejar de ser cachorros, y a los perros de tamaño híper les encantará dar la pata cuado se les anime a hacerlo. ¡Empiece enseñando a su mascota estos trucos favoritos de siempre!

Dar la pata – izquierda y derecha

CÓMO ENSEÑÁRSELO:
Cuando da la pata, su educado chucho eleva la pata hasta la altura del pecho, permitiendo que los invitados se la cojan. Esta orden se puede aprender para ambas patas.
1 Con el perro sentado frente a usted,

ORDEN VERBAL

esconda una golosina en su mano derecha, y bájela hasta el suelo. Anime al perro a tocarla con la pata diciendo “cógela” y “choca”. Prémielo con una golosina cuando levante la pata del suelo.
2 Eleve gradualmente la altura de la mano hasta que la levante a la

altura del pecho.
3 Pase a utilizar la orden manual. Levántese y sostenga la golosina en

la mano izquierda, detrás de su espalda, y extienda la mano derecha mientras pronuncia “choca”. Cuando la pata del perro toque su mano extendida, sosténgala en el aire mientras lo premia con la golosina que tiene detrás de su espalda.
4 Repita estos pasos en el lado opuesto para enseñarle “pata”.

LOCALIZACIÓN Y RESOLUCIÓN DE PROBLEMAS
EN LUGAR DE TOCARME LA MANO CON LA PATA, MI PERRO LO HACE CON LA NARIZ Déle un golpecito en la nariz para disuadirle de hacerlo. Es posible que intente ladrar, hocicar o no hacer nada. Sea paciente, siga animándole. Si no levanta la pata por si mismo, déle un golpecito o levántela levemente por él y después prémielo.

QUÉ ESPERAR: Cualquier perro puede aprender este truco, y siempre
es un gesto simpático. Practique un par de veces por día y déjelo siempre cuando lo esté haciendo bien. Encadene estas órdenes alternando “choca” y “pata” de forma sucesiva y rápida.

APROVÉCHELO Una vez haya
perfeccionado las órdenes choca y pata, utilice una acción similar para enseñarle marcar el paso (página 176) y decir adiós (página 202).

y personas han vivido en relaciones simbióticas a lo largo de la historia, aportando ambos prestaciones de gran valor. Las personas aportan comida, cobijo y atención veterinaria, mientras que los perros han ofrecido tradicionalmente al ser humano protección y ayuda en la caza, en el control del rebaño, el control de alimañas y el transporte en carro y trineo. En el mundo moderno de hoy es posible que de su perro no se espere que sirva para estas habilidades tradicionales, pero eso no significa que no pueda aprender nada. Su perro puede ganarse su manutención ayudando en la casa con estas tareas modernas.
Los perros necesitan tener algo que hacer. Desean sentirse útiles y adoran trabajar por los elogios y un sentido del cumplimiento. En este capítulo aprenderá algunos trucos útiles que pueden formar parte de las tareas diarias de su perro. Seguro que enseñárselas a su perro costará un esfuerzo, pero piense en el tiempo que ahorrará cada día cuando el perro vaya a por su periódico por la mañana, le traiga las zapatillas y ordene sus juguetes en la caja correspondiente. (Intente también estos trucos con los niños.) Su perro se entusiasmará más con estas tareas si siente que son trabajos importantes. Cuando le traiga el periódico por la mañana, tómese un momento para apreciar este maravilloso trabajo en lugar de simplemente soltar el periódico en la mesa. Cuando le traiga el bolso, no deje que se vaya dejándolo caer o mordiéndolo, porque se trata de un artículo de valor. Y si le ofrece con orgullo dos zapatillas de pares distintos, ¡póngaselas sin dudar! Después de todo, ¿qué es más importante que los sentimientos de su mejor amigo?

3 En la misma sesión, ofrézcale la bola de goma de una bocina de

bicicleta en lugar del juguete. Utilice un tono entusiasta cuando lo anime a “gritar”. Cuando produzca algún sonido, dele inmediatamente una golosina.

QUÉ ESPERAR: Si el perro es un entusiasta de los juguetes que pitan,
puede aprender este truco en un día. Es un truco muy bueno para despertar a los niños o para cuando todo está demasiado tranquilo en casa.

LOCALIZACIÓN Y RESOLUCIÓN DE PROBLEMAS
MI PERRO NO MUERDE LA BOCINA LO BASTANTE FUERTE COMO PARA QUE SUENE La bocina es más dura que un juguete que pita, de modo que al principio tendrá que hacer trampa y hacerla sonar con el dedo pulgar cuando el perro la coja con la boca. Pronto aprenderá que el sonido es el efecto deseado.

Lujos modernos
de nuestros días son miembros de la familia en toda regla en el entorno doméstico; duermen en camas, llevan ropa y toman comidas de gourmet. Las aptitudes que en el pasado se exigió a los perros que vivían en el exterior han sido sustituidas por una serie de habilidades más prácticas dirigidas a la vida moderna actual. Aunque la capacidad de un perro para cazar y traer la cena fue en su momento de gran importancia, ahora es más habitual que se aprecie el que un perro sepa encontrar el mando de la tele, responder al teléfono y sobre todo traerle un refresco de la nevera.
Hay algo en un perro que hace cosas “de personas” que los seres humanos encontramos simpático. Cuando los enseñamos a responder a una orden con una conducta natural (como traer cosas), los hemos enseñado a asociar una palabra con una acción determinada. Cuando los enseñamos a ejecutar una “conducta humana”, los hemos enseñado no sólo la palabra, sino también una idea compleja que implica respuestas lógicas y físicas no instintivas. Pero seamos honestos. Los trucos de este capítulo a menudo no se enseñan por el mero hecho de mejorar la materia gris de un perro. Se enseñan por dos razones: para impresionar a los amigos y para ahorrarse un viaje a la cocina cuando se tiene ganas de tomar un refresco.

Coger el teléfono cuando suena
CÓMO ENSEÑÁRSELO:
Cuando el teléfono suena, el perro lo coge y se lo trae. Si es un móvil, el perro lo encuentra y se lo trae.
1 Deje el teléfono en el suelo y levante el

auricular. Dígale al perro “cógelo” (página 24) y prémielo por esta acción.

ORDEN VERBAL
¡Ring!

2 Aléjese del teléfono y pídale trae (página 24) el auricular. Introduzca

su orden verbal imitando lo mejor que pueda el ring del teléfono. De nuevo, premie al perro si lo trae bien.
3 Aleje progresivamente el teléfono de su sitio inicial (colocándolo

primero en una mesa pequeña, después en una repisa y luego detrás de la repisa). Si su perro es pequeño, es posible que necesite un taburete para llegar al teléfono.
4 Ahora tendrá que asociar el ring verdadero del teléfono con la orden

verbal que utilice. Use una segunda línea de teléfono para marcar el número. Cuando suene, dé la orden verbal y señale el teléfono. Es posible que el perro se asuste un instante, pero ordéneselo cada vez que el teléfono suene.

QUÉ ESPERAR: Utilice un teléfono viejo durante el aprendizaje, porque
los perros a menudo sueltan el auricular en el suelo. Sostenga el móvil y las golosinas en la mano, y llame a su número unas pocas veces al día. Este truco implica muchas cosas que entusiasmarán al perro; sonidos fuertes, saltar repisas y traer el teléfono. A menudo es uno de los trucos favoritos ¡tanto para el perro como para los que llaman!

¡Gol!

¡El público va a enloquecer cuando su atleta canino consiga un punto para el equipo! Apodado Fido el Volador, su perro va a chutar, encestar, coger y bloquear para llegar al corazón de todo el vecindario una vez aprenda a participar en los juegos. ¡Seguro que va a ser el primer escogido para el equipo!

¿Qué hacen los amigos en los fines de semana libres? ¡Practican deportes! Tanto si es un partido de fútbol en el exterior como si es uno de futbolín en un salón recreativo, la competición en el deporte siempre ha sido compartida entre amigos. Ahora, con estos trucos, su compañero canino puede participar en sus juegos. Tanto si tiene debilidad por la silla de montar como si es un fan de los tiros libres o tiene un chute fantástico, el perro puede aprender las normas de esos conocidos deportes y jugar a su lado.

Practicar un deporte con su perro crea aptitudes de comunicación y establece normas que reforzarán la relación. Considérese a sí mismo un entrenador cuando le enseñe estos trucos. Utilice energía y motivación, pero también disciplina y autoridad. El juego debe ser una recompensa en sí mismo, y tendrá que exigirle al perro que siga las normas para conseguir esta recompensa. Sea justo, honesto y paciente. Todas las grandes estrellas de las ligas empezaron cuando eran muy pequeños, y eso es lo que su perro va a hacer también. ¡Salgan afuera a jugar!

Fútbol
CÓMO ENSEÑÁRSELO:
Los fans del deporte seguro que sacan algún chute de su perro superestrella cuando va a por el gol deslizando una pelota de fútbol en la red.
1 Una pelota de juguete de golosinas de las que se venden en tiendas de

animales es una pelota hueca con un ORDEN VERBAL agujero que, al rodar, va soltando golosinas Fútbol aquí y allá. Llénela con golosinas y déjesela al perro unos días para que juegue con ella a su aire. Es probable que se convierta en su juguete favorito.
2 Señale una pelota sin golosinas y dígale al perro “¡fútbol!”. Cuando

haga rodar la pelota un poco, láncele una golosina cerca de la pelota para que la encuentre.
3 Progresivamente, exíjale que la distancia a lo largo de la cual hace

rodar la pelota sea más larga y pase a premiarlo con la mano en lugar de lanzarle la golosina.
4 Pase a usar una pelota de fútbol, utilizando la misma orden verbal y

premiándolo por un trayecto corto. Exíjale cada vez más distancia.
5 ¿Está el perro listo para intentar ya un gol? Marque una línea distintiva

delante de la red, como el margen de una superficie determinada respecto a un campo de hierba. Corra enérgicamente con el perro y anímelo a empujar la pelota sobrepasando esta línea. Cuando lo haga, prémielo inmediatamente.

QUÉ ESPERAR: Los perros a menudo aprenden muy rápido a hacer rodar LOCALIZACIÓN Y RESOLUCIÓN DE PROBLEMAS
MI PERRO SE DESPELLEJA LA NARIZ Con una pelota nueva o un juego muy enérgico el perro puede despellejarse la nariz. Revísesela periódicamente y compruebe si en la pelota hay zonas que se enganchen. MI PERRO TOCA LA PELOTA CON LA PATA EN LUGAR DE HACERLA RODAR Su perro se frustra y no entiende qué es lo que quiere usted. Vuelva a utilizar la pelota de golosinas, pero ponga sólo una golosina en su interior. Oirá que hay algo dentro, pero la golosina tardará mucho en salir. Prémiele por hacerla rodar con golosinas de su mano. la pelota llena de golosinas por sí solos. Puede haber cierta confusión cuando se pasa a la pelota de fútbol, momento en el que es posible tener que volver un paso atrás más de una vez. ¡Si practica a diario, en unas pocas semanas el perro puede estar camino de la Copa del Mundo!

“Este es mi juego favorito: perseguir el testigo. Este es mi otro juego favorito: perseguir el frisbee.”

Capítulo 7

Saltos y paradas

es la clave cuando el perro y usted realizan saltos y paradas sincronizados. Aprenderán a confiar el uno en el otro y a interpretar cada movimiento al trabajar en colaboración para llevar a cabo un truco. Los premios son los propios ejercicios y los éxitos se miden en sus sonrisas y en los ladridos y movimientos de cola de su mejor amigo.

Trabajar en equipo

A los perros les encanta saltar (es un comportamiento estimulante y que recompensa por si mismo). Los trucos en los que se salta y se realizan paradas impresionan al espectador, porque exhiben la velocidad, la gracia, la coordinación y el atletismo de su perro. Un perro que salta es un perro feliz, y la gente no puede evitar sentirse inspirada por su entusiasmo por vivir.

Pero saltar es también un ejercicio intenso y doloroso si el perro no está en plena forma o tiene problemas de salud o lesiones. Esté atento a la posible presencia de signos de incomodidad y recuerde realizar estiramientos, calentar y enfriar bien al perro. No lo anime a saltar más alto de lo que le permita un esfuerzo moderado, y controle su postura para que los saltos y aterrizajes los realice en un ángulo lo más horizontal posible.

Saltar sobre una

barra
CÓMO ENSEÑÁRSELO:
El perro aprenderá a saltar una barra.
1 Coloque una barra de salto o cree una

ORDEN VERBAL

versión casera con dos sillas y un palo de Hop o salta escoba. Por razones de seguridad, la barra debería caerse si el perro la toca. Coloque la barra a poca altura: 7 – 15 cm para perros pequeños y a 30 – 45 cm para perros medianos.
2 Con el perro atado con la correa, corra con él hacia el salto. Grite un

entusiasta “¡Hop!” cuando salte por encima de la barra con él y prémielo si lo hace bien. Puede darle una golosina, pero la mayoría de perros disfrutan del salto en sí mismo. Si el perro no quiere saltar, baje la barra hasta el suelo y camine por encima de la misma junto a él. Evite tirar del perro para que camine por encima, y estimúlelo mucho.

LOCALIZACIÓN Y RESOLUCIÓN DE PROBLEMAS
MI PERRO TROPEZÓ CON LA BARRA Y AHORA LE DA MIEDO La mayor parte de lo que recuerde de este accidente dependerá de su reacción. Anímele a “llevársela” y en el futuro asegúrese de que la barra se cae y de que el suelo es antideslizante. En lugar de una correa que pueda enredarse, utilice una cuerda corta y que no pese.

3 A medida que la confianza de su perro aumente, eleve

progresivamente la barra. Intente enviar al perro a saltar desde distintas posiciones. Ordene al perro quieto (página 18) y llámelo desde el lado opuesto del salto. O sitúese en el lado desde el que va a saltar y hágale señas para que salte. Haga que describa un 8 en la zona de salto: salto hacia adelante, círculo hacia la izquierda y vuelta hacia usted; salto hacia adelante, círculo hacia la derecha y vuelta hacia usted.

QUÉ ESPERAR: La mayoría de perros disfrutan saltando y lo
aprenderán fácilmente si se les estimula lo suficiente. En pocos días su perro será un gran saltador.

Atravesar aros Los aros
de la muerte en llamas (en realidad hula hoops adornados con jirones de color naranja) no son ningún problema para su valiente amigo, puesto que saltará y volará confiado a través de aros que dan vueltas y ruedan, cubiertos de papel.

Lo mejor de los aros es que cualquier perro puede aprender los trucos en los que aparecen; con un poco de imaginación, hay un sinfín de tipos de truco que los pueden incluir: aros que ruedan, brazos formando un círculo, aros en el suelo, aros sobre su espalda, aros debajo, aros encima, aros pequeños, aros grandes, e incluso dos aros. Una vez aprendido, el perro recordará este truco para siempre. Los perros establecen fácilmente la relación entre los aros y otros objetos circulares, como el obstáculo del neumático en el agility, e incluso sus brazos dispuestos formando un círculo. Esté donde esté, puede improvisar un círculo y deleitar a sus amigos.

Para evitar que el perro pase al lado del aro, intente colocarlo en el espacio de una puerta.

2 Cuando el perro lo haya aprendido, empiece a aumentar la altura a

3 Suponiendo que su perro tenga la suficiente habilidad física, eleve el

aro de nuevo para que el perro deba saltar para pasar a través de él. Intente empezar corriendo o utilice la mano en el lado opuesto del aro para atraerlo hacia arriba. Para reducir el riesgo de lesión del perro al girar en el aire, adquiera el hábito de lanzar la golosina delante del perro para que no tenga que girar para volver a por ella.

Carrera de obstáculos La vida
está llena de obstáculos, y cuanto antes aprenda el perro a esquivarlos, mejor. Los obstáculos de este capítulo requieren habilidades de lógica y a menudo constituyen retos tanto físicos como mentales. Algunos de ellos pueden incluso asustar al perro al principio, por lo que la confianza del animal en usted será un ingrediente necesario para el éxito. Sea paciente y amable, y anímelo pero no lo obligue. Es posible que al principio el perro dude, pero una vez salga por el otro extremo del túnel (literalmente), se habrá convertido en un perro más confiado.
El perro tiende a superar obstáculos con una mayor imprevisión que el ser humano. Su principal preocupación tiene que ser la seguridad del perro. No olvide las revisiones veterinarias y explore las patas, orejas y piel del perro con frecuencia. Compruebe si en los obstáculos hay clavos, astillas o lugares en los que las patas del perro puedan quedar enganchadas. Trabaje sobre una superficie blanda y asegúrese de que los obstáculos tienen una superficie adherente. En los saltos, el perro tiene que aterrizar recto hacia adelante, no girando, y en un ángulo lo más horizontal posible. Aumente la dificultad progresivamente, puesto que una mala experiencia puede retrasar considerablemente el avance. ¡Combine varios obstáculos para que el reto sea aún mayor!

Túnel
CÓMO ENSEÑÁRSELO:
El perro correrá por dentro de un túnel recto o curvado. El túnel es uno de los distintos obstáculos del deporte canino agility.
1 Dé tiempo al perro para que explore un

ORDEN VERBAL

túnel corto y recto en un lugar conocido. Túnel Sitúelo en el extremo opuesto y mantenga contacto visual con él por dentro del túnel. Atráigalo hacia usted. Si intenta venir por fuera del túnel, pida a un amigo que lo sujete y lo guíe. Prémielo con una golosina a la salida del túnel.
2 Una vez se sienta cómodo yendo por dentro del túnel, sitúese de pie

en la entrada con él, ordénele “túnel” y guíele para que entre. A menudo es de ayuda correr al empezar. Cuando esté corriendo dentro del túnel, corra con él por fuera, animándole, para que pueda oír dónde está usted. Cuando salga por el otro extremo, siga corriendo a su lado a lo largo de una distancia corta para animarle a salir corriendo.
3 Instale un túnel curvado. Es posible que el perro intente hacer un

¿PUEDO COLOCAR GOLOSINAS DENTRO DEL TÚNEL? Puesto que el objetivo es que el perro atraviese el túnel corriendo, las golosinas podrían crear el mal hábito de hacerle dudar a medio camino.

giro en U dentro y vuelva atrás saliendo por donde ha entrado, de modo que mírele hasta que se asegure de que lo hace bien.

QUÉ ESPERAR: La mayoría de perros disfrutan corriendo por dentro
de un túnel, y una vez se acostumbran, ¡lo harán cada vez que puedan! Los perros confiados pueden incluso aprenderlo en un solo día, mientras que los más tímidos necesitarán más tiempo.

CONSEJO ¡Usted es muy alto! Baje al

A mi lado: hacia adelante y hacia atrás
CÓMO ENSEÑÁRSELO:
Un perro que obedece la orden a mi lado camina al lado izquierdo del entrenador. En obediencia canina, cuando el entrenador se detiene, el perro se sienta automáticamente. En el estilo libre (baile canino) la orden “a mi lado” es menos estricta, y se centra más en el contacto visual y la forma de andar.

A MI LADO:
1 Con el perro sujeto por una correa floja a

su lado izquierdo, diga “a mi lado” y camine hacia adelante, avanzando primero el pie izquierdo. Este paso se convertirá más tarde en la señal que el perro entenderá como “a mi lado”. Dé siempre la orden verbal primero, antes de empezar el movimiento.
2 Premie al perro de vez en cuando por un

El perro de un hombre inteligente

en los animales siempre ha sido un tema de debate, pero ningún propietario de perro le dirá que le sorprende la inteligencia de su perro. Como en los seres humanos, la capacidad mental de un perro aumenta con el uso. Cuanto más desafíe a su perro a utilizar sus capacidades de comprensión, lógica y razonamiento, antes captará los nuevos conceptos.
Los trucos de este capítulo tienen dos cosas en común: requieren que el perro piense mucho y dependen de una eficaz comunicación entre usted y el perro. Al perro se le pedirá no sólo que lleve a cabo una conducta sino que ésta se base en criterios que se le habrán comunicado. No sólo tendrá que traer un objeto, sino específicamente el que huela de determinada forma, el que obedezca a una señal manual o el que responda a una orden verbal. Estos difíciles conceptos pueden agotar mentalmente al perro. Utilice diez veces más elogios que represalias, puesto que para el perro es fácil sentirse frustrado y desmoralizado. Incluso tras haber aprendido un concepto, volverá a cometer errores sin remedio. Concédale el beneficio de la duda, puesto que no es probable que coja el objeto que huele como le ha pedido o que traiga el objeto equivocado a propósito. ¡El aprendizaje es un proceso que dura toda la vida y estos ejercicios mantendrán a su perro mentalmente activo para siempre!

QUÉ ESPERAR: Los perros son sorprendentemente astutos
cuando leen nuestro lenguaje corporal. Esté atento a sus movimientos y sea coherente con las señales. Si lleva a cabo este truco para un público, tenga en cuenta que los perros en situaciones con las que no están familiarizados pueden dudar a la hora de ladrar.

Introducción

El propósito de este curso es hacer una introducción a los secretos del adiestramiento canino, pero al mismo tiempo ayudarte a solucionar algunos de los problemas más comunes que te están robando el verdadero disfrute en la relación con tu perro. ¿Qué es el Adiestramiento canino? Adiestramiento canino es el proceso mediante el cual una persona logra que un perro aprenda y adquiera ciertas destrezas específicas, y logre mantener esas destrezas. Puesto que las conductas adiestradas necesitan mantenimiento, el adiestramiento de un perro es una actividad de por vida. No es posible decir "mi perro está adiestrado" y no practicar nuca más. Sin embargo, una vez que las conductas adiestradas se convierten en hábitos, el mantenimiento es fácil y no requiere mucho esfuerzo. El adiestramiento de un cachorro debe comenzar desde el mismo momento que llega a tu casa, en este momento el está lleno de energía, es fácil de entrenar y todavía no ha adoptado ningún mal habito. A continuación iremos viendo lo más importante que debes saber para comenzar a adiestrar a tu perro. Ten siempre presente que un adiestramiento de obediencia no modificará las malas conductas que tu perro tenga; pero te hará mucho más fácil poder trabajar con él para modificarlas y principalmente te permitirá prevenir las alteraciones en el comportamiento a lo largo de toda su vida y conseguir un perro equilibrado y feliz de compartir su vida contigo y toda tu familia.

El adiestramiento de obediencia forma parte de la educación que puede recibir un perro, sin embargo no podemos considerarlo como la educación en sí misma, sino más bien un buen medio para facilitar la educación del perro. De esta forma podemos enseñarle determinados ejercicios como acudir al llamado, sentarse, echarse, etc., que si son aprendidos y obedecidos por el perro contribuyen a dejar bien claro el mensaje acerca de quién es el líder y quién el seguidor dentro del grupo.

Uso del Refuerzo Positivo Una de las técnicas o recursos que podemos usar para el éxito en el adiestramiento de un perro es el Refuerzo Positivo. Esto consiste en dar una recompensa inmediatamente después de que haya realizado un ejercicio en forma correcta. O sea darle un premio que esté vinculado con los dos motivadores más importantes de los perros: La Supervivencia y la Comodidad En el primer caso puede ser un bocadito sabroso que sea de la preferencia de nuestro perro; como pequeños trocitos de pollo cocido, de salchicha o de carne cocida, por lo que tu primera tarea será averiguar qué tipo de recompensas motiva mejor a tu perro. En el segundo caso podría ser un juguete, un juego o una caricia y una palabra de elogio. Debes dar la recompensa inmediatamente después de que realiza la acción que tu le quieres enseñar. Los refuerzos positivos suelen ser cosas agradables para el individuo, o cosas por las que el individuo está dispuesto a hacer algún trabajo. Un refuerzo positivo siempre aumenta la frecuencia de una conducta deseada. Los reforzadores positivos más comunes en el adiestramiento de perros son la comida y los juegos. Sin embargo, también existen otros reforzadores que puedes usar. Todos los perros son diferentes entre sí, y cada uno tiene preferencias particulares. La mayoría de los perros serán fácilmente motivados por los alimentos que huelen bien y que les agrada comer. Deberás prepararlos en trozos pequeños y mantenerlos en una bolsita que puedas llevar contigo cuando vas a entrenar tu perro. No te recomiendo que uses alimento balanceados ya que estos no estimularán a tu perro con la misma intensidad que la carne. Prueba cuál es el alimento que más irresistible resulta para tu perro y este será la mejor recompensa para darle durante las sesiones de adiestramiento. En mi

experiencia lo que más les gusta a los perros es la pechuga de pollo al horno o a la parilla. Ahora ya estás listo para salir a entrenar a tu perro..!! Ya tienes el mejor motor para ponerlo a trabajar. Recuerda que debes entregarle la recompensa inmediatamente; no más allá de un segundo después que realizó la acción indicada. Si te demoras más tiempo esta técnica no te dará resultado ya que tu perro no relacionará la recompensa con la acción realizada. También es muy útil dar una segunda recompensa que actúe como un refuerzo secundario y que sea de tipo emocional, como una palabra de elogio y felicitación dicha en un tono muy amistoso; lo que creará entre tú y tu perro un vínculo de Líder y seguidor. Esta palabra siempre será la misma y deberás decirla simultáneamente con unas palmaditas en el pecho o en la zona de las costillas. Esto hace que él asocie el cumplimiento de la orden con el afecto que tú le das. Esta misma palabra de elogio deberás repetirla varias veces a lo largo del día cada vez que realice un comportamiento que tu deseas reforzar en su conducta. Es importante aclarar que los premios comestibles no son imprescindibles en el Adiestramiento canino. Todo depende de cada perro y de cada ejercicio. En éste ebook te enseñaré ejercicios en los que uso premios y otros en los que no los uso.

Lección Nº 1 Que Reconozca su nombre

Esta primera enseñanza es una de las más importantes en el adiestramiento, ya que si la realizamos bien tendremos un perro muy obediente que nos dará grandes satisfacciones y será la envidia de nuestros amigos y conocidos Para el perro su nombre solo significa “ven aquí” y por nada del mundo debemos usar su nombre para otras cosas como para retarlo, para ordenarle que se quede quieto, que deje de ladrar, que deje de rascar una puerta , etc. De esta manera convertimos el nombre del perro en una súper-orden de múltiples significados que solo generará confusión en el perro. Para comenzar a enseñarle esta lección debes preparar la bolsita con la recompensa que usarás como ya estuvimos explicando anteriormente. Busca la que más le gusta a tu perro; puede ser trocitos de pechuga de pollo cocida, trocitos de salchicha, o trocitos de carne a la plancha bien pequeños que los pueda tragar de un solo bocado. Puedes comenzar a hacer este entrenamiento en el patio de tu casa y a medida que vaya respondiendo bien puedes sacarlo a un parque o descampado siempre y cuando no haya muchos perros sueltos o mucho tráfico de autos o gente que lo distraigan demasiado. Comienza caminando unos pasos con él, sujetándolo por su collar y correa, te detienes y lo observas; cuando él comienza a mirar a su alrededor tu pronuncias su nombre, si se voltea y te mira; inmediatamente le das un bocadito y le dices una palabra de elogio con tono agradable como “muy bien, bien, bueno, genial”, etc. Siempre debe ser exactamente la misma palabra cada vez que le enseñas algo y responde en forma positiva. Repite este proceso de 5 a 7 veces siempre de la misma manera.

Si no responde es probable que haya muchas cosas en el ambiente que estén llamando su atención y no le permitan enfocarse en el ejercicio, recuerda que no solo lo que ve lo puede distraer sino principalmente los olores y algunos sonidos. Muévete unos metros de ese lugar e inténtalo nuevamente, ten paciencia y por nada del mundo le demuestres enfado o mal humor. Debes hacer de estas sesiones algo totalmente placentero para el perro y para ti, si él relaciona el adiestramiento con algo alegre y divertido siempre estará dispuesto a aprender y a obedecerte. Pronuncia una sola vez su nombre, lo único que debes lograr en esta lección es que él se de vuelta y te atienda al escuchar su nombre. Puedes realizar dos sesiones diarias de 10 minutos. Debes variar la hora y el lugar del entrenamiento, dentro de tu casa y afuera, también podrías probar dentro de tu casa sin el bocadito; solo con la felicitación y el elogio, si no funciona agrega la recompensa hasta que vaya aprendiendo y luego comienzas a probar solo con la palabra de elogio. En una semana debería haber aprendido y ya podrás pasar a la siguiente lección o enseñanza que veremos a continuación. Obviamente siempre debes continuar repasando las lecciones anteriores para que no se olvide. En esta lección el bocadito o recompensa es el refuerzo positivo primario, es el motor para poner en marcha a tu perro, pero luego viene la felicitación o elogio que será el refuerzo secundario que le brindará a tu perro una recompensa emocional y le ayudará a crear contigo una perfecta dupla de Líder (tu) y seguidor (él). Esta palabra deberá ser corta, fácil de entender y ser la única que utilices siempre, tanto tú como los demás integrantes de tu familia. Esta misma palabra la utilizarás a lo largo del día cada vez que tu perro realice un comportamiento agradable o que merezca ser elogiado. La palabra de felicitación puede ir acompañada de caricias en el pecho o en las costillas, nunca en la parte superior de su cabeza ya que puede ser interpretado por algunos perros como una provocación. Las caricias además refuerzan el lazo afectivo con tu perro. Esta combinación de Premio-Felicitación generalmente es irresistible para cualquier perro. Ten presente que debes pasar algunos momentos previos y posteriores al entrenamiento solo jugando con tu perro para que él siempre relacione éstas sesiones de adiestramiento con la diversión. Y no olvides que es muy importante que durante los momentos del día donde no lo llevas a entrenar no debes usar su nombre para cualquier cosa, sólo para que acuda a ti.

Lección Nº 2 Sentado a la Orden

Siempre que te dispongas a enseñarle alguna lección a tu perro recuerda que para ellos el lenguaje corporal es más importante que los sonidos (palabras). Por lo que siempre debes ocuparte de ser congruente en forma de comunicación, o sea que tu lenguaje corporal y tu voz le transmitan la misma orden. Primera Semana Lleva a tu perro con su collar y correa a un lugar donde no haya mucho movimiento de personas, autos o perros. Lleva en una bolsita la recompensa preferida de tu perro, recuerda cortarla en trocitos bien pequeños para que pueda tragarlos de un solo bocado sin tener que ponerse a masticar. Déjalo caminar un poco reconociendo el lugar del entrenamiento. Incluso si juegas primero un ratito con él será muy positivo para el correcto aprendizaje de la lección. Luego de unas cinco a diez minutos ya comenzamos el trabajo. Toma un trocito del alimento, déjalo en tu mano con el puño cerrado y pasa tu mano delante de su nariz para atrapar su atención sobre la recompensa. Inmediatamente comienza a llevar tu mano con el puño cerrado por encima de su cabeza hacia la parte posterior de la misma, pasando por entre las orejas y llegando hasta la nuca. En su intento por seguir tu mano el perro se verá casi obligado a sentarse. Cuando se sienta; automáticamente le das su recompensa y le dices la palabra de felicitación, por ejemplo: muy bien…!!! o la que tu elijas y lo acaricias en el pecho o en las costillas. Es fundamental que no pase más de 1 segundo entre que se sienta y recibe la recompensa. Luego de esto lo haces parar y comienzas a caminar para que él te siga, luego de 5 o 6 pasos vuelves a repetir exactamente el mismo proceso. Por ahora no le dirás ninguna palabra para que él se siente, solo la maniobra que te expliqué. Realiza unas 7 repeticiones y luego te regresas a tu casa.

Realiza 2 sesiones diarias durante 1 semana. Cuando tu perro se siente enseguida que tú le acercas la mano a la cara con la recompensa será el momento de hacer una pequeña variante en el ejercicio que sería la siguiente: Segunda Semana Una fracción de segundo antes de comenzar a acercar tu mano a su cara le dices la palabra “sentado” o “sit” o la que tú quieras utilizar. Siempre la misma. Cuando se siente le das su recompensa y la felicitación o palabra de elogio junto con las caricias en el pecho o en las costillas. Repite ésta variante del ejercicio unas 7 veces y haz 2 sesiones diarias durante 1 semana. Las sesiones debes realizarlas en distintos horarios y en distintos lugares todos los días. Tercera Semana Esta parte puede ponerse un poquito más difícil pero no te hagas problema que seguro que lo logras también. Comienzas a acercar tu mano a la cara de tu perro como lo hacíamos la primer semana pero ahora sin ningún alimento, o sea sin el bocadito de recompensa. Con la mano abierta; la acercas a su cara pero sin detenerla y continúas con el movimiento en forma ascendente con la palma de la mano hacia arriba hasta la altura de tu rostro. Algo similar a la seña que le harías a una persona para que venga hacia ti. ¿Entiendes? Obviamente que en este caso la seña la realizarás un poco más lento. En el mismo momento que haces la seña le dices la palabra “Sit” o “sentado”. Cuando se sienta le dices la palabra de felicitación y elogio: “muy bien “ y lo acaricias cariñosamente en su pecho. Repite el ejercicio unas 7 veces, 2 sesiones diarias durante una semana. Cuarta semana: Es la prueba de fuego final. No usas ningún bocadito ni orden hablada; solo haces la seña de la semana anterior y cuando se sienta lo felicitas y lo acaricias amorosamente. Repites unas 7 veces el ejercicio, 2 veces por día durante 1semana. Aquí finaliza la enseñanza de sentado. Debes practicarlo en tu casa o cuando lo sacas a pasear un par de veces al día para que no se olvide. Si en algunos de los pasos tu perro se confunde o le cuesta simplemente le tienes paciencia y vuelves a repasar la lección.

Leccion Nº 3 Que Responda al llamado

¿Por qué mi perro no obedece cuando lo llamo? La gente cree que el perro sabe que está actuando mal, ya que lo notan como asustado, como si sintiera culpa por lo que está haciendo. Luego el perro huye, cruza a la calle, se refugia en su casa, como si supiera que lo que hizo estaba mal hecho. Si yo llamo al perro diciéndole " ven aquí ", y cuando acude ante mí lo regaño o lo castigo, el perro no va a asociar esa experiencia negativa con el hecho de haberse demorado en venir, sino con el hecho en sí de haber acudido a mi lado. El mecanismo es simple: digo " ven aquí ", el cachorro se acerca, y como resultado lo regaño. La asociación simple que hace su cerebro es que “ven aquí” significa que no debía acercarse mí. El perro ha aprendido que " ven aquí " significa que no debe acercarse. De aquí en más ya no hay que enseñarle algo, sino revertir lo que ha aprendido por habérselo enseñado mal, por haber empleado un método inadecuado. Es muy distinto enseñarle un perro que no sabe nada, o tener que corregir y reeducar lo que ha aprendido de forma errónea. Debemos ponernos en el lugar del perro. El perro ante la llamada cruza la calle, se esconde en la casa, actúa como si sintiera culpas por haber hecho algo mal. El perro hace esto porque no comprende cuál es el motivo por el cual yo sigo disgustado, ya que me ha obedecido, ha obedecido a lo que él ha aprendido de acuerdo con un método erróneo. El cachorro está convencido de que mi orden significaba que tenía que alejarse, y no comprende cuál es el motivo por el cual sigo disgustado. Si yo deseo que el cachorro acuda ante mí cuando lo llamo, debo asegurarme de que asocie el acto de acudir cerca de mí con una sensación de placer, de bienestar. Debe relacionar el acto de acudir ante mí con una felicitación, con una aprobación. Y si el perro se demoró mucho para llegar yo no tengo que

regañarlo por haberse demorado, porque se requería de toda una explicación de tiempos que está más allá de la comprensión del perro. En la sencilla mente canina sólo cabe la comprensión de que el regaño tiene origen en haberse acercado a mí, todo lo demás es una explicación absolutamente imposible de comprender para él. El segundo error que esté cometiendo seguramente es estar enojado cuando lo estoy llamando. Con la idea de tratar de expresar una actitud de autoridad, muchos propietarios llaman a su cachorro en una actitud de “pocos amigos”. Y si el perro demora un poco en acudir se ponen furiosos. Así le estás dando a tu perro un mensaje inequívoco de agresión, porque todos los gestos corporales le están indicando que estoy a punto de agredirlo, mi postura denota ese estado de disgusto amenazante, con lo cual no estoy invitándolo a acercarse, por el contrario, estoy diciéndole claramente que la frase " ven aquí " significa que no debe acercarse bajo ningún punto de vista o que debe alejarse si es posible. Si a todo esto le sumamos que cuando efectivamente el cachorro viene se lo regaña o castiga, acabo de cometer el peor error en la educación del mismo, error que será muy difícil de corregir en el futuro. De aquí en más corregir esta situación demandarán mucho esfuerzo, y mucho tiempo. Todo esto por algo que de haber hecho las cosas bien desde un principio había sido muy fácil de evitar. No se trata de que el cachorro cuando huye y se esconde en el hogar lo haga porque siente culpas por haber hecho algo malo; significa que lo hemos confundido groseramente. Lo que debemos hacer es aprender a manejarnos con el lenguaje canino, aprender a comunicarnos con el cachorro, a dar mensajes claros, inequívocos, lógicos y simples para una mente canina que tiene mecanismos también simples. Aprender a comunicarnos de manera efectiva es fundamental, ya que de otra forma estarás tratando de hacerle entender las cosas mediante un discurso largo, ético, complejamente verbal, que está absolutamente fuera del alcance del entendimiento canino. Cuando llames al perro debes estar en una actitud de absoluta amabilidad, debes estar invitándolo a acercarse, ya que esa es tu intención, entonces todo tu cuerpo y tus gestos deben dar un mensaje de amabilidad. Estamos aquí hablando de un cachorro que no se acerca por temor, que aún no ha aprendido nada, es algo absolutamente distinto a cuando notamos que el cachorro no se acerca porque se distrae, o porque sencillamente tiene un temperamento dominante e independiente. En este caso debemos aprender a leer cuáles son las causas de su comportamiento para actuar en consecuencia con los métodos adecuados.

Leccion Nº 4 Perros que saltan sobre las personas

Hoy veremos un perro que salta sobre las personas, en particular, pero esto también se aplica los perros que saltan sobre otros perros, sobre los muebles, o incluso en la cocina. He oído que muchas veces los dueños intentan modificar éste problema mediante el uso de diversas ordenes muy confusas y que no ayudan en nada, también se de muchos dueños de perros desesperados por terminar con éste problema. El perro salta es un problema universal, pero una mejor comprensión de lo que está motivando ésta conducta puede permitirnos un correcto tratamiento con resultados exitosos. ¿Por qué los perros saltan sobre las personas? 2 Causas importantes: 1º) Saltan de alegría 2º) Intentan imponer una posición dominante

1º Causa: Probablemente la más común es el perro que salta dando la bienvenida y festejando el regreso de su amo. Esto puede ser simplemente por un exceso de entusiasmo o sea "saltar de alegría”, pero también se sabe que saltar es un comportamiento instintivo. Los perros lamen la cara a otros cuando quieren dar un saludo agradable, los lobos de más bajo rango de una manada lamen la cara de los lobos de más alto rango

que regresaban de la caza. Además, los cachorros saltan uno sobre el otro para llamar la atención de su madre. Más concretamente, los cachorros tienen como objetivo el rostro de su madre, ya que su madre regurgita el alimento para que sea ingerido por su camada. Además cuando tu perro salta para saludarte cuando llegas a tu casa y tú le das fuertes alabanzas, caricias y palabras cariñosas estás realizando un refuerzo positivo del comportamiento de saltar. O sea le estás dando una recompensa por realizar éste comportamiento que refuerza en su mente el deseo de saltar. 2ª Causa: La segunda razón para saltar, aunque es menos frecuente, es que pueden estar tratando de establecer una posición dominante. Los perros saltan el uno al otro, se apoyan su cabeza o la pata (o las dos patas) en el hombro de un perro que quiere dominar y ejercer un poco de presión. La motivación es la misma al saltar a las personas. El perro puede estar tratando de expresar el estado dominante. En estos casos los perros se paran en dos patas y apoyan sus miembros delanteros sobre el pecho de su dueño Es importante identificar este comportamiento para conocer a tu perro en el contexto más amplio de su relación contigo. En primer lugar, darse cuenta de que un perro desobediente no es necesariamente un tonto. Si no te escucha, y empuja o tira de ti, pueden haber decidido no reconocerte como su superior en la jerarquía de la manada ( aún sin dejar de pensar en ti como su compañero!). Ya sea macho o hembra, un perro que siempre salta es posible que esté mostrando alguno de los comportamientos de los machos Dominantes. (Es algo que trato detalladamente en mi curso “Entrenamiento Elite Para Educar Perros” Si estás sospechando que el salto de tu perro es en realidad una expresión de dominación, entonces es probable que tengas que trabajar más intensamente en su corrección aplicando las tácticas que encontrarás en mi libro. Esto significa que tendrás que hacer más que simplemente ignorar el perro al saltar y entrenar a sentarse y resolver conseguir su atención. Por ejemplo, los chorros de agua de una pistola de juguete, decirle fuertemente “NO “ o incluso obligar al perro empujándolo o dándole un suave golpecito con tu rodilla sobre su pecho hasta que interrumpa este comportamiento. Algunos dueños de perros no les molesta cuando su perro salta para saludarlos, ya que solo lo saludan con un simple "hola”. Aunque parezca lo contrario lo último que queremos hacer es convencer a nuestros perros que no tienen motivos para estar muy contentos de vernos, ni mucho menos. Pero cuando el mismo perro salta sobre otras personas, como miembros de la familia o amigos, puede ser difícil e incluso peligroso. Un perro saltando sobre

los extraños es siempre un mal aspecto. La buena noticia es que un perro bien entrenado puede aprender a NO saltar sobre las personas. Cómo proceder para modificar ésta conducta Durante los saludos, siempre tratemos de evitar que el perro salte en primer lugar. Pon tu mano (o las dos manos) por delante de ti y dile “abajo” o “quieto” con voz firme y segura. Un perro entrenado de ésta forma será capaz de responder a este gesto con cierta rapidez. Para la mayoría, este tipo de prevención no funciona de inmediato, especialmente para los cachorros que carecen de suficiente entrenamiento formal. Tendrás que saber cómo reaccionar cuando tu perro empieza a saltar. Lo más importante es saber qué NO hacer. Por ejemplo, no ser excesivamente entusiasta durante su saludo. Obviamente, esto refuerza la conducta. Y no empujar con fuerza al perro lejos de ti. Es instintivo. El mismo principio es la razón de la mayoría de los casos en que los perros tiran de la correa: son alentados por la fuerza ejercida sobre ellos. A más fuerza se ejerce mas se sienten motivados a tirar de la correa. Da la espalda e ignora al perro. Y con calma pídele que se siente. Cuando se ha calmado, y lo ideal sería respondido a la orden de sentado, entonces puedes dar la vuelta y saludar al perro. Si empieza a saltar de nuevo, repita el proceso. Se paciente, este es el momento donde se llega a enviar un mensaje principalmente a través de tu lenguaje corporal, y el perro seguramente tendrá varios ensayos para recibirlo. A menudo se recomienda que le pegues suavemente con la rodilla para que el perro pierda el equilibrio. Dar la espalda y el obstruirlo es muy bueno si puedes hacerlo. Uno de los consejos que siempre doy es que saludes a tu perro en forma tranquila y "a su nivel." O sea te colocas en cuclillas o de rodillas. Esta es una postura que los perros muy rápidamente asocian con alabanza inminente. A todos nos gusta cuando los demás tratan de reunirse con nosotros lo hagan a nuestro nivel. Los perros no son diferentes en este aspecto. Evitar el contacto es la mejor opción cuando ingresan nuevas personas en tu casa. Si haz establecido tu posición como el miembro dominante de la manada, nunca le debes permitir a tu perro que gane la posición delante tuyo cuando estás por abrir la puerta. Es hora de que te conviertas en el perro alfa. Es una buena práctica dar un tranquilo y firme "abajo" o “quieto “o “sentado” justo antes de abrir la puerta a un visitante. Tu perro está respondiendo a tu sentido de

serenidad y firmeza, y empieza a entender verdaderamente que no hay razón para comenzar a saltar cada vez que abre la puerta. Si haz intentado todo para conseguir que tu perro deje de saltar a todo el mundo, y solo falta cortarle las piernas, tengo una palabra más para decirte: MÁS Ejercicio ! Lo he dicho antes y lo diré de nuevo, los perros necesitan hacer más ejercicio de lo que creemos, y si no tienen una forma de gastar su energía, lo harán saltando arriba y abajo en las personas en forma incontrolable. Así que mantén la actividad física de tu perro como parte fundamental en el entrenamiento de obediencia.

Leccion 5 Por qué mi perro No me obedece

Ahora vamos a llegar hasta el fondo de una de las experiencias más frustrantes para cualquier propietario de perro: un perro que ignora las órdenes.

Motivos de la desobediencia
¿Todavía estás prestando atención? Supongo que sí. Pero asumamos por un momento que no lo estás haciendo. Puede haber varias razones para que no me hagas caso: 1) puede ser que estés distraído por algo mucho más urgente o apasionante, más emocionante que éste curso. 2) Puedes estar convencido de que algo muy desagradable va a ocurrir si obedeces a mi solicitud de prestar atención. Mi tono de voz incluso te puede sonar amenazador. 3) Tal vez estuviste prestando atención la última vez, y nada bueno resultó de ello. Ningún elogio verbales, ningún premio motivador, ni siquiera una palmadita tranquilizadora en la cabeza. Tu realmente no tienes ninguna razón para escucharme esta vez. 4) o, quizás simplemente no entiendes y decides ignorarme - después de todo es sólo eso: una decisión. Si no consigues entenderme de entrada no podrás responderme. Todas estas son razones que podrían explicar la decisión de tu perro de desobedecerte. Si estás listo para obtener más información sobre las causas de la desobediencia de tu perro y saber exactamente qué hacer al respecto, entonces estás listo para la segunda entrega de éste curso

¿Por qué mi perro no me hace caso?

Tu perro está haciendo caso omiso de ti y no te gusta. A nadie le gusta ser ignorado. Incluso esto provoca frustración y enojo. Esto hace que llegues a ser ignorado aún más como resultado de tu enojo. Es bastante común que los perros ignoraren los comandos. A menudo los propietarios de los perros dan muy pocas razones para escuchar y un montón de razones para no hacerlo. Un escenario típico podría ser algo como esto: Un propietario llama a su perro y le dice "ven", el perro lo ignora, el dueño lo llama nuevamente pero ya alzando el tono de voz, el perro sigue haciendo caso omiso, el dueño empieza a marchar hacia el perro furioso, apretando los dientes, con toda la determinación de alguien que no está dispuesto a tolerar esta falta de respeto (sobre todo en público), el perro empieza a gatear de mala gana hacia el dueño, percibiendo claramente el enojo de su propietario, por último, el propietario toma el perro con fuerza por el cuello, tal vez incluso tira de un golpe o dos para recordarle al perro de quién es el jefe aquí…!!! Si tú haces esto lamento decirte que está totalmente mal, por favor no lo sigas haciendo. Con esta "técnica" se puede llegar a conseguir algún resultado, pero obviamente será en el camino equivocado. Por no decir nada sobre el daño potencial de los castigos físicos, que supongo que no es necesario explicar a nadie que se ha suscripto voluntariamente a un curso de entrenamiento canino de obediencia). En el largo plazo, esta forma de disciplina se establece una relación basada en el miedo y las amenazas, en lugar de una relación de sano de respeto. Tu perro necesita un líder, y debe ser capaz de reconocer y responder a lo que llamamos “órdenes “o "comandos". Pero eso no significa que debas amenazar o asustar a tu perro. Usamos comandos, cortos, sencillos y directos porque los perros no hablan español, y no porque les gusta ser ordenados de ésta forma. A pesar de que tienes que estar por encima del perro, no tienes que hacer que el sonido sea como una amenaza para establecer su posición en la jerarquía. Todo lo que suena como una amenaza no recibirá ninguna respuesta positiva. Un perro desobedece órdenes sobre todo por una de éstas dos razones: 1) No te entiende. Porque los perros responden más al tono de las palabras que estás usando, si tu tono contradice tu comando, no le darás a tu perro una idea clara de lo que quieres que él haga. Por ejemplo, digamos que tienes un perro llamado Bob que salta sobre ti todo el tiempo. Si tú dices abajo" y al mismo tiempo te ríes y lo empujas suavemente, casi en broma, acabas de comunicar a tu perro el texto siguiente: "abajo" es igual a "este juego es divertido, vamos a seguir jugando".

Otro error relacionado es la práctica de pedir a un perro a hacer algo si es que al le parece correcto hacerlo. Así pues, dicen, ven aquí", de manera que suena como "¿Podría tal vez venir aquí por favor?? Entonces le estás efectivamente dando a tu perro una elección. Por el contrario debes dejar claro que el comando es una orden y no hay otra posibilidad. También, asegúrate de que tus comandos son bastante simples. Si estás bendecido con un perro que entiende ordenes como, tráeme una gaseosa de la nevera", entonces no tienes que preocuparte demasiado acerca de esto. La mayoría de nosotros, sin embargo, necesitamos mantener los comandos breves y simples. Asegúrate de que no suenan demasiado iguales. Por último, siempre es mucho mejor un par de señales con la mano juntamente con las órdenes verbales. En la primera parte de este curso sobre el problema de saltar, hablé sobre el uso de un simple gesto con la mano extendida para decirle a tu perro que se detenga antes de saltar sobre ti, la típica señal de “ stop” de los agentes inspectores del tránsito. Lo ideal sería que llegaran a este punto de obedecer solo con señales de mano. Si has trabajado a través de todas estas posibilidades y tu perro todavía no parece entenderte entonces probablemente necesitas más formación. Para los perros viejos, que van perdiendo su capacidad auditiva, son muy importantes las señales con la mano. 2) Te ignora. Cuando el perro hace caso omiso de tus órdenes, puede significar que entiende lo que queremos que hagan, pero no se decide a hacerlo. Pero, te preguntarás, ¿cómo puedes saberlo? ¿Cómo puedo saber si mi perro entendió mis órdenes pero no tiene ninguna intención de obedecer? La respuesta depende mucho del lenguaje corporal de tu perro. Si está dando señales de temor cuando le estás dando los comandos, como por ejemplo una postura de sumisión, evita el contacto de los ojos, orejas hacia atrás, rabo entre las piernas, etc., entonces lo más probable es que no te entienda. En estos casos, los propietarios pueden empeorar la situación por querer ser más contundentes. Por el contrario, si tu perro adopta una postura de confianza, y no parece asustado, entonces es más probable que haya optado por no escucharte. Incluso puede tener una actitud desafiante - haciendo contacto visual directo, incluso ladrar a ti, y salir corriendo cuando te acerques. Esto sugiere un problema de posición dominante. Tendrías que tomar medidas activas para establecerte como líder de tu perro, además de ser una persona divertida y jugar con él. Pero también hay unos pasos inmediatos que puede tomar para tener más éxito con un perro callejero terco. Volvamos a la hipótesis

común de un perro caprichoso que oye el comando, pero está dispuesto a no obedecer. ¿Qué hacer? • Utiliza un tono de voz positivo y feliz, incluso emocionado. • Toma la posición de cuclillas. Abre tus brazos, como para sugerir un abrazo y le das elogios cuando viene. • Si puedes, trata de caminar en dirección opuesta. Esto obliga a tu perro a tomar una decisión: quedarse, o ir a casa contigo y conseguir su cena. • Elogia a tu perro cada vez que viene, no importa cuánto tiempo tome. • Elogia a tu perro cuando vienen a ti sin ser llamado. Crear un entorno en el que les encante venir a ti.

Qué no hacer • Llamar a tu perro mientras lo persigues porque no vendrá. • Llamar a tu perro para reprenderlo. • Llamar a tu perro por algo que claramente no es un disfrute para él; como cortar sus uñas cortar el pelo, tomar un baño, etc.)

Un consejo final: si tu todavía estás luchando con tu posición como líder de la manada, te recomiendo profundizar en el entrenamiento de obediencia como una gran ayuda para lograrlo, será un gran remedio te lo aseguro!

Leccion Nº 6 Ladridos Excesivos

¿Por qué hay perros que ladran todo el día? Se puede decir que los perros ladran porque queremos que lo hagan. Cuando se comenzó a domesticar los perros hace entre 15.000 y 150.000 años atrás, vimos la ventaja potencial de un muy leal y muy vocal compañero, por lo que se criaron selectivamente a los perros que ladraban partiendo de los lobos salvajes, que no ladran. También fueron seleccionado todos los tipos de rasgos que creíamos eran lindos, como los ojos grandes y caras planas. Pero los perros ladradores comenzaron a ser muy apreciados y por lo tanto sus genes fueron privilegiados. En consecuencia, ciertas razas de perros, como los tradicionalmente perros de guardia, se sabe que son charlatanes pesados. Tú siempre debes considerar muy bien la raza a la hora de conseguir un nuevo perro para evitar los problemas relacionados. En cualquier caso, aun cuando tu perro parece ladrarle a la nada, te aseguro que están ladrando por algo, a veces cuando presenta ladridos que se activan después de que han desaparecido durante 20 minutos más o menos, y luego vuelve a retomar sin cesar puede ser un indicio de Ansiedad por Separación, un estado psicológico que trato detalladamente en mi libro “Como educar un perro paso a paso.

Si comienza a ladrar hacia el final del día, podrían tener hambre. Podría necesitar de ejercicio o tal vez ir al baño. Como muchos especialistas en conducta canina han dicho: los perros son animales sociales, tú y tu familia constituyen ahora la manada de tu perro, es normal que tu perro comience a ladrar si lo dejan solo durante largos períodos de tiempo. Una vez que has descartado algunas de las razones mencionadas y le has dado a tu amigo el ejercicio suficiente y la atención necesaria, puedes comenzar a concentrarte en la educación de un perro que se la pasa ladrando. Debes tratar

de identificar las causas. El ladrido puede ser causado por estímulos externos o internos. Un malestar externo puede ser una alarma que se activa por una persona que pasa, o un perro, o insectos como por ejemplos las moscas o los mosquitos. Además, a menudo se pueden eliminar los estímulos externos a través del sentido común. Por ejemplo, tuve que lidiar con un perro que se trasladó con su propietario de una casa con una aldaba (pieza de metal que cuelga de las puertas para llamar golpeando con ella) a otra con un timbre en la puerta. El perro se comportaba bien y en general era tranquilo. Pero cada vez que sonaba el timbre de la puerta de la nueva casa el perro comenzaba a ladrar desesperadamente sin parar. Le sugerí que quitara el timbre y colocara a los visitantes un pequeño cartel en la puerta que dijera “Golpear y llamar”. Problema resuelto. Si tu perro ladra inmediatamente después de que les has dado una orden, entonces tienes que hacer algún tipo de arreglo en el dominio que ejerces sobre él, es muy posible que no tenga claro o no haya aceptado tu Liderazgo.

Momento del Ladrido A) Cuando el propietario está presente B) Cuando el propietario está ausente

Qué hacer en el caso “A”. Detener el ladrido del perro, puede ser un verdadero desafío, si la única vez que ladra es cuando tú no estás en casa. A menudo, estos perros necesitan un programa de educación que no sólo se ocupe de los ladridos, ya que posiblemente sea un caso de ansiedad de separación. Sin embargo, si ladra en tu presencia, puedes corregir el ladrido en el momento adecuado, y además utilizar la alabanza como recompensa cuando obedece. Tratar el problema de que ladra cuando tú estás presente también puede ayudar a evitar que suceda cuando estás ausente. Hay varios métodos discutidos, que tienen diferentes grados de efectividad: * No hacerle caso, esperar, y cuando se calla le das la recompensa. Esto es bueno para los perros que son demandantes de atención, pero necesitarás un poco de paciencia, y tal vez un buen juego de tapones para los oídos. Lo importante es recompensar inmediatamente después de que se detenga el ladrido.

* El método de pistola de agua.. Puede ser una molestia, y si no eres un pistolero bastante rápido, disminuye el efecto del método. Debes preparar una solución de agua y vinagre (una parte de vinagre en ocho partes de agua. Debes apuntarle al pecho, no la cara. En muchos casos funciona bien, en otros fracasa. Hay que probar. * El método de la correa. Se le coloca la correa en el cuello y se le da un pequeño tiró seco de la misma a la vez que se le dice “No”. Este es un buen método. * Pero aquí está el más favorable y más rápido: Método de corrección física. No, no es nada violento, doloroso, o inhumano. Cuando el perro ladra, debes ir junto a él y colocarte de rodillas a su nivel, con firmeza envolver con una o con ambas manos alrededor del hocico (no lo sacudas), y repite el comando correctivo “No” o “Sshhh...”. La idea es mantenerlo así hasta que haga silencio (obviamente, no pueden ladrar con su boca cerrada aunque si puede llorisquear para que lo sueltes), incluso también hasta que deje de resistirse a la maniobra. Este método es eficaz también porque afirmas tu papel dominante en el proceso. Porque se trata de una corrección física, no puede ser una opción preferida para los propietarios que se sienten incómodos con este tipo de interacción. Pero sólo puedo destacar que los perros no son los niños y se sienten más seguros con una idea clara de un jefe de manada seguro y firme en el que pueden confiar. Cualquiera que sea el método que elijas, sólo la repetición rendirá sus frutos. Nunca le grites. Es como ladrarles. Sólo lo estimulas a ladrar más. Aunque es fácil gritarle a tu perro para que se calle por una ventana abierta, porque te da pereza, y si tu perro está ladrando porque tiene que decir algo, incluso si es sólo que quieren un poco más de atención, gritándole solo lograrás confundirlo más . Como siempre, dar elogios y/o premios cuando deja de ladrar. (Refuerzo positivo) Con todo, es necesario permitir que tu perro a veces pueda expresarse y lucir su hermosa voz. No es realista que siempre reprendas a tu perro cada vez que comienza a ladrar. De hecho, esto puede tener consecuencias peligrosas si el perro está queriendo avisarte algo, se confundirá y se sentirá inhibido a ladrar la próxima vez. Recuerda, si son ladridos para indicar la llegada de alguien tratando de vender algo en tu casa; los ladridos harán que el vendedor se vaya más rápido..ja..ja..

Qué hacer en el caso “B”

OK, ahora es el momento de hablar de esa difícil situación de un perro que ladra sólo cuando estás fuera de tu casa. Obviamente, la mayoría de los problemas con los perros que ladran son el resultado de que los perros no tienen a su propietario alrededor para calmarlos. De hecho, la ausencia del dueño, en muchos casos es lo que está despertando el deseo de ladrar del perro. Un perro solitario ladrando o llorisqueando puede ser una molestia difícil de abordar, pero todavía hay algunas cosas que podrías hacer. Trata de volver a casa con más frecuencia, o trata de organizar que un amigo te vaya a visitar, de ser posible con su perro amistoso y enérgico. Se puede llegar a cortar el problema de raíz. Si sabes que tienes el problema de que tu perro está ladrando y posiblemente molestando y enojando a tus vecinos deberías aplicar un poco de relaciones públicas para evitar problemas. Si es posible, pregunta a tus vecinos si están siendo molestados por ladridos procedentes de tu casa y, si es así diles que estás trabajando en ello que tengan un poco de paciencia. También puedes intentar organizar una salida falsa. Camina una vuelta alrededor de la casa o lo que sea necesario para que tu perro piense que te has ido. Cuando el perro comienza a ladrar, reapareces repentinamente y le das la orden “No” o ssshhh Puedes utilizar collares especiales, que utilizan la energía sonora o eléctrica para corregir a tu perro, algunos casos funcionan muy bien en otros regular. Una mejor opción para los dueños de perros desesperados es programar llevar al perro en las horas de tu ausencia a una guardería. Algunos perros simplemente no reciben la estimulación suficiente durante el día, y es por esto que adquieren el hábito de ladrar descontroladamente.

Leccion Nº 7 Perros que tiran o jalan de su correa

Qué hacer para que tu perro no te arrastre durante el paseo Ahora veremos cómo hacer para que tu perro deje de tirar de la correa. He tenido tantas preguntas sobre este problema, que parece ser un problema universal. Quién no ha visto algún blooper divertido en un vídeo doméstico, es muy común encontrar algún tipo de escena cómica de un perro tirando de la correa y arrastrando a su propietario. A menudo, esto implica a un perro muy grande y un dueño muy pequeño. Causas Los perros tiran de la correa como una cuestión de instinto. Como animales de caza, que viven de la caza; muy a menudo tiran porque están en búsqueda de algo (un gato, un ratón, u otro perro). Pero hay otras razones que también son muy comunes. Es posible que estén sin control sobre-excitados debido a su falta de libertad. Y es posible que ellos se vean como el animal dominante en tu familia. En este caso, ellos lo ven como que está desobedeciendo eres tu..!!! sí , aunque suene gracioso ( cómico ) eso es lo que cree el perro. Qué hacer * Establecer límites claros * Dominar la técnica del paseo * Dar dos caminatas diarias * Entrenamiento de obediencia * Uso correcto de collar y correa

Cualquiera que sea la razón, el método tradicional de abordar la cuestión de tirar de la correa es más o menos el mismo en todos los casos. Se trata de dominar la técnica del paseo: Técnica correcta del paseo 1) El perro tira de la correa. 2) Te detienes. 3) Le das una orden verbal aguda como por ejemplo “no” 4) y luego de un rápido tirón tomas de nuevo la delantera. 5) Se comienza a caminar de nuevo. 6) Repetir todo el proceso. Esta técnica de formación lleva un poco de tiempo y suficiente repetición. Pero en el corto plazo comenzarás a notar mejoría. Existen algunas técnicas de formación innovadoras en torno al problema de tirar de la correa. Una de ellas es "caminar al azar". El concepto es brillantemente simple: un perro dominante o demasiado ansioso no puede tirar de la correa si no sabe en qué dirección se dirige: Debes cambiar de dirección con frecuencia, ir por distintos lugares, doblar a la derecha, luego a la izquierda, luego retroceder. Así es muy probable que tu perro desista de la idea de llevar la delantera y tirar de la correa. Otras de las alternativas son los collares de cabeza o collares Halti. ¿Cómo es un Collar Halti? A diferencia de los tradicionales collares de perro que van alrededor del cuello, éstos collares consisten en una correa de nylon que rodea al hocico y luego el cuello. En el extremo lleva una correa corta, que se extiende debajo del cuello. ¿Cómo funciona? Ambas cintas están diseñadas para tener una función específica. El bucle de la nariz está diseñado para imitar la práctica de demostrar dominio entre dos animales con firmeza teniendo a otro perro de la boca. La correa para el cuello tiene como fin producir calma y relajación al perro imitando la práctica de una madre que toma a sus crías por la parte posterior del cuello. Además, la correa aplica presión a la parte posterior del cuello en lugar de la parte delantera de la garganta.

Los perros tienden a responder al ejercer una fuerza de oposición, es por eso que a menudo responden tirando más cuando su dueño comienza a tirar en sentido contrario. Estos collares están diseñados para revertir este comportamiento, y detener el movimiento hacia adelante cuando la fuerza se ejerce sobre el cuello. Más importante aún, la iniciativa permite al propietario el control de la cabeza del perro, similar al arnés de los caballos. El control de la cabeza siempre tiende a controlar al animal. ¿Qué tan efectivo es? En mi experiencia, es extremadamente eficaz en la corrección de tirar, particularmente eficaz con los propietarios que les gusta correr con sus perros, Puede ser utilizado para facilitar los comandos básicos de obediencia, como "siéntate" y "abajo". Puede ayudar un poco también para detener los ladridos no deseados (por medio de un tirón rápido que cierra la boca del perro), aunque no suele ser muy eficaz en este sentido. Quizás lo mejor es que estás constantemente entrenando al perro sin necesidad de dar comandos constantemente. Además, estás reforzando tu papel como líder. Si te detienes, se detienen, simples como eso.

Leccion Nº 8 La Agresividad Canina. Como Reconocerla y Como Prevenirla

Este es el problema de comportamiento más frecuente en los perros. En estado salvaje es una conducta perfectamente normal que tiene la función de protección de los perros, pero en la vida junto al ser humano es una conducta inaceptable y que necesita ser modificada. La agresión representa más del 50% de los problemas de conducta en los caninos. Es el problema de comportamiento más frecuente en los perros. En estado salvaje es una conducta perfectamente normal que tiene la función de protección de los perros, pero en la vida junto al ser humano es una conducta inaceptable y que necesita ser modificada. La agresión representa más del 50% de los problemas de conducta en los caninos.

Tipos de Agresión Hay varios tipos de agresión diferentes en los perros, por lo que es necesario poder determinar de qué tipo se trata en cada caso para poder tratarla como corresponde. Además el pronóstico para cada una de ellas es bien diferente, por ejemplo no es lo mismo la agresión maternal la cual se puede resolver fácilmente en la mayoría de los casos, que la agresión por dominancia que es muy difícil de solucionar y su pronóstico es reservado, ya que la mayoría de las veces no se puede resolver satisfactoriamente. En mi libro “Como educar un perro paso a paso 2.0” podrás encontrar la clasificación de los tipos de agresión canina y las características de cada una (son más de diez) así como la forma particular de tratar a cada una.

En esta entrega me centraré en la agresión del perro que se expresa con los extraños y otros perros, lo cual pueden ser muy estresante para los dueños de perros y causar problemas reales. Lo que descubrirás es que el comportamiento agresivo es tan estresante para tu perro, y en realidad es tu responsabilidad enseñarle a él o ella que ésta conducta no sólo es inapropiada, sino que también es totalmente innecesaria ¿Qué es exactamente? Te lo diré. Pero primero vamos a asegurarnos de que sabemos lo que estamos tratando, cuando vemos o estamos delante de un caso de agresión.

Signos de agresión La mayoría de las personas, ya sean propietarios de perros o no, no reconocen los signos de agresión hasta que es demasiado tarde - hasta que comienza una pelea. Los signos comunes de agresión son gruñidos, ladridos, fruncir labios, erizado de los pelos del lomo y dorso, embestir y una postura amenazadora en general, donde el perro está tenso y listo para agredir. También hay algo conocido como la sonrisa de un "sumiso" mostrada por algunos perros, en la que el animal en realidad muestra sus dientes mientras se aproxima. Este comportamiento muchas veces es confundido por los propietarios como un signo de agresión, cuando en realidad es todo lo contrario un signo de “sumisión” .La diferencia es que el perro baja la cabeza al acercarse al animal dominante o al líder humano y, a menudo meneo la cola también. Hay otras indicaciones o signos de agresión, tales como saltar sobre una persona, montar su pierna simulando una conducta sexual o quedarse de pie obstruyendo el paso, etc.; que son muy importantes y a menudo ignorados por el propietario que no advierte éstos signos tempranos de problemas de agresión en su perro. Es muy importante ser capaz de reconocer éstos comportamientos que nos van avisando con tiempo para poder actuar y comenzar a trabajar para modificarlos. Los perros cuando quieren conocer a alguien (humano o canino) se acercan vacilantes y en "círculo". Es probable que incluso podamos ver la desconfianza o la sospecha en sus ojos.

Los perros tienen dos áreas en su espalda donde pueden poner los "pelos de punta", elevando el pelo de su capa. Una de estas zonas está situada entre los hombros y la otra justo por encima de la cola, esto se produce cuando algo generó malestar en el perro, será más evidente en unos perros que en otros, dependiendo de la capa, pero siempre significa un estado muy elevado de conciencia y excitación, y es el preludio de la agresión. Por lo tanto, pelos erizados a pesar de lo que se ha planteado no significa automáticamente agresión, significa que debes prestar atención y hacer tu parte para asegurar que la situación no termine en una escalada agresiva.

¿Cuál es tu parte exactamente? ¿Qué tienes que hacer? En la mayoría de los casos los perros se vuelven agresivos, porque no saben qué otra cosa hacer en esa situación. La razón por la que no saben qué hacer es porque no hay nadie allí para decirles o enseñarles qué hacer. En ausencia de orientación y liderazgo, se ven obligados a tomar todas estas decisiones por su cuenta. Eso no sólo es una posición francamente peligrosa para ellos y es también injusta, veremos porqué. Se habla mucho sobre la importancia del establecimiento de tu papel como líder. Ahora todo el mundo sabe lo importante que es posicionarse a sí mismo en la parte superior de la manda que conformamos los humanos con los perros. Tienes que saber que siempre es estresante para un perro ser el líder dominante o perro "Alpha" , realmente no lo quiere ser. Cuando la función de un perro no está clara por su dueño, la presión cae sobre las espaldas del perro que debe tomar la responsabilidad de proteger a su dueño, proteger su territorio, protegerse a sí mismo, proteger su propio papel, etc. Eso es un montón de trabajo y mucha preocupación. Y el resultado es muy a menudo un perro agresivo que en realidad no tiene por qué ser así. Castigar a un perro tratando de modificar su conducta con violencia inevitablemente empeora las cosas. Para dar algunos ejemplos, ahora que sabes lo que parece una postura agresiva, si ves éstas señales en otro perro, evita pasar cerca de ellos con tu perro. Al mismo tiempo, mantén tu confianza y tus nervios intactos cuando lo haces: tu perro es sensible hasta el último bit de su ansiedad. Sólo conduce a tu perro caminando tranquilamente paso a paso. Si no hay espacio suficiente para pasar junto a otro perro con signos de agresión, dale la orden a tu perro de "sentado” hasta que el perro sospechoso haya pasado. Si el

propietario no mantiene a su perro bajo control, podrías incluso hacerle saber de que debería tener cuidado y tomar las precauciones necesarias. Lo contrario también se aplica: si te encuentras con un perro que se está mostrando juguetón y amistoso, dile a tu perro que se trata de un "amigo" y que un saludo es aceptable. Si es posible, he comprobado que funciona bien si tú saludas al perro primero, y luego permites que se saluden ellos en segundo lugar.

Con todo, es necesario comunicar a tu perro lo que es una amenaza real y qué no lo es, y, en realidad, no hay casi nada en este mundo que debe ser una verdadera amenaza para tu perro si estás haciendo tu trabajo como su líder firme y seguro. Necesitas comunicarte siempre de una manera tranquila pero firme. Se trata de manejar correctamente tu lenguaje corporal, recuerda que el perro se guía más por esto que por las palabras habladas. No importa lo que le dices, si actúas como si estuvieras asustado o nervioso; tu perro hará lo mismo. Nuestro mundo no es igual al mundo de un perro - nuestro mundo es mucho más grande, mucho más ruidoso, y de hecho, mucho más aterrador. Pero es nuestro mundo, el cuál le hemos exigido a nuestro perro que conviva con nosotros y que se comporte en él como nosotros queremos, razón por la cual está de más aclarar que necesitan el tipo adecuado de orientación.

Cómo Prevenir la agresión canina * Correcta Socialización * Correcta Jerarquización * Elección de la raza correcta * Prevención mediante el Test de Campbell Socialización Una lección sobre la agresión del perro no estaría completo sin al menos una breve discusión sobre la piedra angular de la obediencia del perro: la sociabilización. Sociabilización significa simplemente dejar que tu perro pueda vivir las diferentes situaciones sociales que regularmente tendrá que enfrentar en la vida. Esto período se inicia a los 45 días de vida y finaliza a los 4 meses de edad del cachorro. Tu perro necesita interactuar con otros perros y otras personas

absolutamente tanto como sea posible. Los perros que no son sociabilizados con otras personas y otros perros son muy a menudo los mismos perros que tienen problemas de agresión. Cuando tu perrito tiene sus momentos de juego déjalo interactuar con otros perros - perros de más edad y mayor tamaño - que lo mantengan "a raya" si él intenta mostrar un comportamiento dominante. En el otro extremo, no dejes que tu perro se relacione con otros perros que tienen un temperamento muy fuerte o que pueda intimidar al tuyo en todo, hasta el punto de causarle estrés, perdida de la confianza y retraso de su normal desarrollo emocional. La sociabilización del perro es un tema de enorme importancia, y es por esto que te recomiendo que puedas informarte más en profundidad sobre éste tema en mi libro “Como educar un perro paso a paso” y así hacer las cosas del modo correcto para evitar futuros problemas de conducta en tu perro. La lucha contra los problemas de agresión es una situación muy incómoda para la familia, por lo que se hace imprescindible tomar las medidas correspondientes y actuar tempranamente para evitar problemas muy desagradables en el futuro. Si tu perro no ve a nadie, y se pasa la mayoría de las horas del día encerrado, y ve muy poco fuera de los límites del patio de la casa; no se lo puede culpar por actuar un poco extraño cuando comienza a salir al gran mundo que lo rodea afuera.

Leccion Nº 9 Perros Excavadores: Un hábito Muy

molesto

Llegar a casa y encontrar agujeros en todo el césped del jardín que con todo esmero estamos cuidando es muy frustrante. y si tienes un perro la correlación existe. Pero no te molestes en tratar de enfrentar a tu perro después del hecho. El castigo después del hecho es ampliamente conocido como el menos eficaz y potencialmente más dañino de todos los tipos de entrenamiento de perros en la tierra. Incluso si traes a tu perro al lugar, lo tomas por la piel del cuello y los regañas mientras diriges su cabeza en su profunda obra, no tendrá ni idea de lo que estás haciendo. Causas de éste caprichoso hábito Primera Posibilidad "¿Estará tratando de escapar? Si tu mascota no está castrada, entonces puede ser que esté poniendo en práctica su instinto itinerante (trasladarse de un lado a otro), y las excavaciones pueden ser parte de su plan de “fuga” amorosa. Segunda Posibilidad Que tu perro está haciendo pozos para intentar encontrar su libertad. Si tu perro realiza las excavaciones durante un período de ausencia, de hecho, puede tener problemas de ansiedad por separación que tendrás que tratar directamente. Una vez que se trata éste problema ya no se le ocurrirá continuar excavando en tu jardín. Tercera Posibilidad

¿Hace demasiado calor en el lugar donde está tu perro? Todos sabemos que los perros eliminan calor mediante el jadeo. Pero también les gustan las madrigueras para refrescarse, especialmente cuando no hay un lugar de sombra a la vista. Así que tendrás que descartar esta posibilidad como factor motivador para la excavación de tu perro, y asegurarte de que tiene un lugar para mantenerse fresco. Por último ¿No estará enterrando sus cosas?" Esto es simplemente una vieja costumbre que se deriva del hecho de que sus antepasados a menudo guardaban lo que no podían comer en una sentada. Este hábito puede ser difícil de romper, pero trata de cambiar la costumbre de dejarle huesos al perro cuando estás por ausentarte. Un hueso jugoso puede ser un gran regalo para tu perro cuando estás en casa, pero puede ser el motivo de sus excavaciones cuando te vayas. Puede que tenga que cambiar las zonas de acceso del perro, o cercar un área que deseas mantener para el campo de fútbol infantil. También puedes intentar la creación de una zona de tierra o excavación en una caja de tierra o de arena donde le permitas expresar sus instintos. Muchos perros son salvajes sobre la arena, e incluso se puede atraer a la zona, enterrando algunos huesos en éste lugar. He visto ésta opción dar buenos resultados. En el gran esquema de los problemas de obediencia del perro, sin embargo, esto debería ser más una molestia más que otra cosa. Algunos dueños me recuerdan que es mejor tener una mascota saludable y feliz aunque tengan que sacrificar un césped perfecto. No está mal.

Leccion Nº 10 Las Personalidades Perrunas

Los perros pueden presentar distintas personalidades muy diferentes entre si, es muy útil saber esto ya que al elegir un cachorro nosotros podemos ir sabiendo que tipo de personalidad va a tener nuestro perrito, e incluso de acuerdo a las características de nuestra familia podemos seleccionar al cachorro que posea la personalidad que más conveniente para cada caso. Algunos tipos de personalidad Dominantes Son perros muy seguros de si mismos, no importa a que raza pertenezcan. Son naturalmente muy seguros de si mismos: Nunca manifiestan temor ni inseguridad. Miran de frente y a la cara. Intentan intimidar a las personas con su lenguaje corporal. Llevan su cola erguida, muestran sus dientes, algunas veces tienen el pelo del lomo erizado y ladran en forma amenazante. Suelen resistirse al adiestramiento y necesitan un líder de carácter fuerte que les transmita una energía firme, segura y tranquila. Muchas veces necesitan de un adiestrador profesional.

Sumisos Son perros que se muestran inseguros, se asustan y hasta paralizan cuando se les da una orden. Evitan mirar a los ojos, meten el rabo entre las piernas cuando se les da una orden. Se encogen de miedo cuando alguien se les acerca. Necesitan métodos de adiestramiento suave y lento. No debe dárseles órdenes muy bruscamente. Es necesario ser muy paciente con ellos a la hora de adiestrarlos.

Intermedios La mayoría de los perros entran en ésta categoría .No son dominantes ni sumisos, son una mezcla de ambos. Con algunas personas son dominantes y con otras son sumisos. No presentan demasiada dificultad en el adiestramiento. Distraídos Son los perros que siempre están queriendo jugar. Les cuesta estar atentos y obedecer a sus amos durante el adiestramiento. A veces esto se debe a que no se acostumbraron al trato con las personas desde cachorros. Conviene siempre adiestrarlos en casa.

Cooperativos Son animales que manifiestan permanentemente responsabilidad y atención. Son los perros más fáciles de adiestrar. Tienen una afinidad natural con las personas y aprenden muy rápidamente. Ahora ¿Cómo podemos saber que personalidad tiene cada cachorro al momento de elegir nuestro próximo compañero? Hay una forma muy fácil y muy efectiva que enseño en mi libro Como educar a tu perro paso a paso 2.0que te permitirá evitar muchos problemas y dolores de cabeza a toda la familia a la hora de seleccionar el nuevo cachorro con el que compartirás muchos años de tu vida. Estoy seguro de que estas lecciones serán muy útiles para ti, y te aliento a que no dejes de aplicar éstas poderosas técnicas y secretos con tu perro, estas lecciones te permitirán disfrutar de una mascota sana, equilibrada y feliz, pero sólo si las estudias, aplicas y practicas con paciencia y perseverancia.

How to Communicate With Your Dog
Whether you have a new canine companion or you and your dog have been together for a while, it's helpful to know the meaning of your dog's communication methods so that you can adjust your own behavior as needed and so that you can be assured of your dog's feelings. Dogs make vocalizations and gestures using their face and body just as humans do, in order to express their feelings. And while some of these gestures can appear very similar to our own, they can have very different meanings. In this article, you'll learn a range of interpretations for your dog's messaging and you'll learn how to communicate effectively with your canine pal.

Steps

1

Spend some time just watching your dog. Learning your dog's habits, mannerisms, and movements through observation will allow the process of understanding its behavior to feel more natural and there will be plenty of things it does that will make sense to you without explanation. Just as every person is unique, so is your dog, and knowing its particular way of being is something that only you can understand fully.

Spend some time just watching your dog.

Be aware that much of a dog's language or communication skills are subtle. The importance of learning canine language resides in the fact that you will be able to respond to any problems it expresses before they become more marked. Not noticing small signs of stress or unhappiness can soon lean to more aggressive or distressed behaviors. Remember that this is a two-way learning process. Dogs have to learn our behavioral cues as well, and knowing this is just as important because it will affect how you

respond to your dog, causing you to be more careful about your own gestures and posture. Note that a dog's ability to signal may be hampered by the breed in question, for example, if a dog has squat ears, a docked tail, etc.

2

Start by understanding the value of dog eye contact. Consider how you feel when someone stares at you directly rather than uses normal eye contact standards. Just as you find it confronting, dogs also feel confused and threatened by direct head-on staring because it is a threat stance for them. A dog that looks away in this situation is actually being polite (or submissive) and is seeking to avoid confrontation.[1]

Start by understanding the value of dog eye contact.

3

Look at your dog's posture. The ways in which a dog holds its body can tell you a great deal about its mood and emotions. Many of the signals will be subtle and it can take some time to learn all of its expressions but it is well worth the effort. Here are some of the most common positions to know:

Look at your dog's posture.

Confident stance: A dog that is feeling confident will stand tall, have its tail up and probably wagging slowly, its ears will either be pricked up or relaxed, and it will generally look relaxed. Its eyes will have smaller pupils as they are also relaxed.[2]

Confident stance: A dog that is feeling confident will stand tall, have its tail up and probably wagging slowly, its ears will either be pricked up or relaxed, and it will generally look relaxed.

Bowing: Facing you and with head and chest dipped low to the ground to the ground, front legs splayed out, and with rear end and tail up is a clear invitation to play. This is known as the "play bow".[3] It can be mistaken by owners as an attack stance but it clearly denotes playtime.

Page 3 of 21

Hip swings: Hip swings or nudges are another sign of play.This involves the dog swinging around another dog and knocking them to the ground using the backside (the end of the dog without teeth!).[4] When the dog's rear is presented to you, it is an indication of trust and depending on your dog, it might mean your dog wants a scratch. Wiggling its rear end is a sign of excitement and friendliness.[5]
Bowing: Facing you and with head and chest dipped low to the ground to the ground, front legs splayed out, and with rear end and tail up is a clear invitation to play.

German Shepherds are renowned for this trait

Rolling over: This action exposes the dog's underbelly and is a gesture that shows respect for authority. Giving a belly rub serves as excellent reinforcement for this behavior. This action can also indicate passive resistance, resisting a threat in a passive and indirect manner, using feet to push away the problem (such as an owner clipping nails); in this case, if it is you it is directing the passive resistance at, it is likely to resort to finding a number of play distracting behaviors to get you to do something else![6]

Rolling over: This action exposes the dog's underbelly and is a gesture that shows respect for authority.

Pacing: Pacing can mean excitement, nervousness, or boredom (from a lack of exercise or things to play with). Raised hackles: This refers to the strip of fur running down the middle of the dog's back. When it is raised, it can be a sign that the dog feels threatened and is trying to

Page 4 of 21

make itself appear larger than normal. It is not necessarily an aggressive stance but one of "high alert", making itself ready for whatever may come next.[7] A scared dog can bite, so be extremely careful around a dog raising its hackles.[8]

One of the signs of a pacing dog may be a well worn path

Frightened or insecure: The dog will cower or crouch down. A slight crouch will denote submissiveness or nervousness. Another response can be an arched back, slightly bent legs, and the tail down (but not tucked under), and looking at what is concerning it.[9]

Frightened or insecure: The dog will cower or crouch down.

Suddenly freezes in the middle of action: This means that your dog isn't feeling sure of itself and would rather be left alone, or is preparing for an attack.[10] This is commonplace when a dog is holding a bone; don't get between the dog and its bone!

Suddenly freezes in the middle of action: This means that your dog isn't feeling sure of itself and would rather be left alone, or is preparing for an attack.

Aggressive or threatened: The dog will lean forward and appear rigid. This occurs in response to what the dog perceives as a threat or a challenge. The tail will usually be tucked down or under, wagging in a quick and frantic manner.[11] The whites of the eyes will likely show as the dog turns away to look.

Look at your dog's gestures. Just as with people, certain gestures are clear signals that can be interpreted and understood. Some of the more common ones include:

Look at your dog's gestures.

Uncertainty or puzzlement: This can be expressed in a number of ways, such as raising one paw, keeping most of the body away from the person, animal or object creating uncertainty, and backing away. If the head is tilted to one side, this means that the dog is listening, or is uncertain and puzzled and is awaiting more information.

Mounting: Mounting (or humping) can be a sign of stress in a dog, especially where a low-confidence dog is trying to establish allegiance with a higherconfidence animal.[12] Mounting is difficult for owners because it can be used as a dominance gesture, seeking to be more dominant in the pack than another person. Care should be taken when interpreting this gesture and the standard training approaches to prevent a dog from jumping up can be applied.

Raised paw touching knee or other part of person: The kneading associated with obtaining mother's milk as a pup turns into a pacifying gesture.[13] As time goes on, the raised paw becomes a way for the dog to get attention when it wants it from a human, to make a request or ask for something, or to indicate a wish to play with other dogs.[14] Pawing at the air is often used by puppies as an invitation to play.[15] You can interpret the raising of a paw as similar to that of offering a hand for a handshake – it's about connecting and friendship.[16]

Dominance: This can be established in a number of ways, including placing their head or chin, or a paw, on the back neck or shoulders of another dog.[17] This may be accompanied by staring and standing tall or standing over another dog.

Shaking the head and shoulders: This signals an end to an activity, such as resting, playing, or training. It can also signal the end of a certain level of tension, such as being alert to a threat or an anticipated event that doesn't occur.

Check the tail signals. While adorable, given that we don't come equipped with tails, it can be a little harder for us to understand tail gestures without further understanding of the behavioral meaning behind tail wagging. The tail can convey some very important information to the astute watcher and it's important to bear in mind that this doesn't always mean happiness! Here are some common tail signals:

Check the tail signals.

Upright tail: This indicates confidence, assertiveness, or high excitement.[18] It can also be seen as an "alpha" dog position around other dogs.

Upright tail: This indicates confidence, assertiveness, or high excitement.

Tail in neutral (level with body or slightly lower: This indicates a relaxed dog, feeling secure and friendly.[19]

Tail lowered or tucked between legs: This shows anxiety, fear, and uncertainty.[20][21] Wagging can still occur in this situation, which can lead to the misunderstanding that the dog is happy. This position can also indicate a need for reassurance or protection.

Tail lowered or tucked between legs: This shows anxiety, fear, and uncertainty.

[[Image:A swing..and a miss.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Fierce wag and tail up: This can indicate that the dog is feeling mischievous and inclined to bother and annoy you or a fellow canine![22] It could also signal swatting away another animal. Slight wag: This indicates that the dog is relaxed but alert and is anticipating, ready to play. Slow wag, tail slightly lowered: This can indicate that the dog is confused and is asking for an explanation, or is investigating a non-threat (curiosity). Slight trembling of the tail, erect: This means that there is a challenge and the dog is displaying dominant behavior. Rapid wagging, tail in low position: The dog is submissive. Slightly lowered tail, and still: This indicates that the dog is alert and watching. If the tail is lowered and is barely moving, it can also indicate insecurity.[23] If there is slight movement with a low tail, this can indicate that the dog is either sad or not feeling well.

Look at your dog's ears. While we're not able to do much with our own ears, a dog's ears can be incredibly expressive.

Well, most dogs can use their ears...

Page 9 of 21

Ears pricked forward or straight up: This can indicate that the dog is fully engaged in play, hunting, or concentration. It's a sign of paying attention.[24] This ear position can also indicate curiosity and can express the intent to do something, as the dog is turning to catch sounds. It is an obvious ear position in the early stage of a chase.[25]

Ears pricked forward or straight up: This can indicate that the dog is fully engaged in play, hunting, or concentration.

Ears flattened: Ears that sit against the dog's head indicate that the dog feels afraid or threatened. Ears that are forward but close to the head can also indicate aggression.[26]

Ears flattened: Ears that sit against the dog's head indicate that the dog feels afraid or threatened.

Ears part way back but not flattened: This indicated unhappiness, anxiety, or uncertainty.[27]

Learn about your dog's eye signals. A dog's eyes express as much as human eyes do, and just as you learn to interpret people's eye signals, you can also learn to interpret your dog's. Here are some of the more common eye signals: Eyes wide open: This means that your dog is feeling alert, playful, and ready.[28] Staring: As noted earlier, this is dominant, challenging behavior.

Avoiding eye contact: This can be a form of politeness (in human speak) or of deference or submission (in dog speak).

Eyes wide open: This means that your dog is feeling alert, playful, and ready.

Staring: As noted earlier, this is dominant, challenging behavior.

Blinking or winking: Your dog is being playful. Narrowed eyes: This can indicate that your dog is feeling aggressive and is preparing to attack.[29] This gesture may be accompanied by staring.

Watch your dog's face. Facial expressions do exist on dogs and they are quite specific. As part of interpreting your dog's gestures and behavior, understanding the facial expressions is crucial:

Avoiding eye contact: This can be a form of politeness (in human speak) or of deference or submission (in dog speak).

Blinking or winking: Your dog is being playful. Watch your dog's face.

Smile: If may be hard to spot a smile from a snarl, but check the entire body language. If everything else adds up to a happy dog, then your dog is smiling, and this means it's happy and relaxed, as with humans. Yawn: Yawning is very dependent on the context, just as it is with us (such as because we're tired, need more oxygen, we're feeling stressed or embarrassed, or we notice someone else yawning). For dogs, yawning appears to be contagious just as it is with humans.[30] Indeed, if you yawn in front of your dog, it may interpret it either as you being stressed (in which case, it will likely turn away from you to give you some space), or it will respond in kind and yawn too.[31] Dogs also yawn as a way to ease

tension, to show confusion or when they feel slightly threatened especially when meeting new situations or new dogs or animals.

Yawn: Yawning is very dependent on the context, just as it is with us (such as because we're tired, need more oxygen, we're feeling stressed or embarrassed, or we notice someone else yawning).

Mouth: A dog that has its mouth stretched back, closed or just slightly open, is showing that it is very stressed, in fear, or in pain.[32] This may be accompanied by rapid panting. If its mouth is stretched back and open, it is an neutral or submissive sign. A dog that is alert and content will have its mouth closed or slightly open, with the teeth covered.[33]

Mouth: A dog that has its mouth stretched back, closed or just slightly open, is showing that it is very stressed, in fear, or in pain.

Lip licking: If your dog licks its lips in combination with a yawn, this can be a clear indication that it is feeling stressed, under pressure, or facing a threat.[34] It's a commonplace gesture shown by puppies around adults, again deriving from suckling behavior. If puppies continue this behavior into adulthood, their constant licking will annoy both people and other dogs alike. And for mature dogs, licking can also be part of the dog's sexual behavior as it finds chemical signals on grass, carpet, and the

http://www.wikihow.com/Communicate-With-Your-Dog

Page 13 of 21

genitals of other dogs.[35] A dog that is licking another dog's lips is showing deferring behavior.[36]

Lip licking: If your dog licks its lips in combination with a yawn, this can be a clear indication that it is feeling stressed, under pressure, or facing a threat.

Bared teeth: This is a signal of aggression and an intention to use the teeth for biting.[37] This doesn't mean that every flash of teeth means aggression though, and you must take care to note the other elements. If the teeth are bared and there is no wrinkling of the muzzle, this is a warning and a sign of dominance and territorial defensiveness. If the lips are curled, the teeth are bared, the muzzle is wrinkled, and the dog is snarling, this indicates that the dog is angry and ready to fight, and there is every chance that it will bite.

Bared teeth: This is a signal of aggression and an intention to use the teeth for biting.

Listen to your dog. Barks, growls, yelps, and howls all carry their own unique language indicators that can take time to learn but are also an important part of understanding your dog's overall behavior. Many people think a bark is a bark is a bark. As you begin to really listen you will hear very distinct differences:

Listen to your dog.

Learn to differentiate your dog's barks: Loud, high pitched, rapid bark: This is both aggressive and territorial.[38] Guttural or short, frequent, alert bark: This type of bark is aimed at warning the pack (wolf or human) of potential danger. It may be accompanied by a snarl, or growls.[39]

http://www.wikihow.com/Communicate-With-Your-Dog

30-04-2013

Page 14 of 21

Crisp, short bark: This is a form of greeting from your dog.

Learn to differentiate your dog's barks:.

High pitched bark: This is often heard when your dog is being playful. A short, high bark is a sign of friendliness, and may be accompanied by whimpering or yapping.[40] High pitched, sharp yelp: This is an indication that your dog is in pain. Low pitched, single or spaced out bark: This is another warning to back off. Learn to differentiate growls. Be aware that play growls are common during play so not all growls are to be viewed as aggressive or worried, but still be careful because a dog that has become too boisterous and carried away in play may still snap at a human who intervenes or gets too close.

Learn to differentiate growls.

Low, quiet growl: This indicates that you need to back off. It is a sign of assertiveness in a dominant dog.[41] Low growl ending with short bark: This is the sound made when your dog is responding to threat. It can be a prelude to a snap. Medium growl, leading to or combined with bark: This type of growl indicates that your dog feels nervous, and possibly aggressive. Low murmuring grumble: This is a lovely sign of contentment. Soft growling is generally play growling;[42] assess it by taking in the context and the general stance of your dog. It will often be accompanied by excited barking. Low sustained growl or 'woofing': This noise is an indication that your dog is feeling either anxious or suspicious. Learn to differentiate howls:

http://www.wikihow.com/Communicate-With-Your-Dog

30-04-2013

Page 15 of 21

Sometimes it's singing...

Long, sustained howl: separation, loneliness Short, howl with rising pitch: This noise indicates that your dog is happy and/or excited. Baying: This is a hunting signal. Siren: This is a response to another howl or a sustained noise. Learn to differentiate whines and whimpers:

Learn to differentiate whines and whimpers:.

Short whines accompanied by short barks: This indicates that your dog is eager, curious, and excited.[43] Short whimpers: This demonstrates fear or anxiety. Low pitched whine: This indicates that your dog is mildly anxious or submissive. [44] Persistent high pitched whine: This is a plea for attention, or reflects intense anxiety, or severe pain. Note that a lack of barking or other dog noises can indicate a predatory state, aimed at not alerting the prey. This may also be accompanied by sniffing the air, keeping low, remaining rigid, ears flicking forward and backward to catch sounds, mouth closed and eyes wide open.[45] Equally, no noise can indicate a submissive dog seeking approval.

10

Understand pack order. Dogs are pack animals, genetically programed to follow the hierarchy of the pack; their behavior and communication is based on their "perceived" position in the pack. The Greek Alphabet is used to designate the positions held in the pack. The more dogs you have, the more this behavior is emphasized. Many of the gestures or postures that dogs use are related to pack order and they are often mistaken for meaning other things. When you understand the gestures as dominant, submissive, or challenging behaviors, you will then be able to understand your dog better and can respond accordingly.

Understand pack order.

Page 16 of 21

Alpha is the leader. This should be you, but look for indications that the dog may think she is. Other dogs will fall into next positionsBeta, Gamma, Delta and so forth until the most submissive is Omega. If you have more than one dog you may see different dominance, submission, challenging behaviors in their play and everyday habits. It is their nature to try to move up in the pack order as well as strive to maintain their own position, so you may notice challenging behaviors at times, even though there is a clear pack order.

11

Watch your own language and messaging. Dogs understand your language but it's on their terms, and through their eyes, although recent research does suggest that dogs may have the ability to understand some of our language.[46] It's very important to understand how you appear to your dog and how some of your gestures may be causing your dog distress, fear, or worry, even though you're completely unaware of this. Always be aware that your dog is watching you, learning, and seeking to predict your routine, habits, and preferences. This is why dogs are so good at You think I'd dress like this if I had predicting what we're about to do; they pick up on any say in it? our subtle body changes and are able to use these to predict our leaving, the arrival of visitors, and even epileptic seizures.[47] It's also how dogs learn that bared teeth in humans is no worry, and that our loud emanations such as sneezing and coughing are of no concern! Some of the common messaging that we can portray to our dogs includes: Withdrawal of our gaze and our arms at the same time. This informs our dog that we have decided not to touch it anymore and this results in her responding negatively.[48] Staring at our dog. This is viewed as a threat by our dog; some trainers believed that a dog looking away was a sign of disobedience but it is better understood now as being one of politeness or submission.[49] Seeing the signs of fear on a dog as guilt and reacting as if a dog deserves punishment. This only serves to increase a dog's sense of fear and does nothing to instill better behavior from our perspective. Patting dogs on the head. Quite a number of dogs do not like being patted directly on the head and this is something a dog usually needs to learn to tolerate.[50] As such, it is never advisable to pat a strange dog on the head until you're more familiar with it. In turn, if you live in an urban environment where people are likely to want to do this, early training (with treats) to help your dog tolerate head patting is essential. Our own yawning, as noted earlier, can indicate to your dog that you're distressed and cause it to move away from you. It can be a good idea to cover your yawn around it if it responds negatively. Hugging and cuddling. Dogs are cute, adorable, and very hug-worthy. The problem is that nature has programmed the dog to believe that being held in close proximity means one of two things: one, that it is trapped as prey, or two, that it is being mounted.[51] Since neither of these actions brings on happy responses, a dog that is not used to frequent cuddling and hugging may respond by fleeing, wriggling, and snapping. If this is the case with your dog, be patient and take a gradual approach to getting it used to your loving embrace. Ensure that children who hug dogs always keep their faces away from the dog, and monitor the dog's reaction so that you can intervene quickly if needed. Instilling a sense of isolation. Dogs are social animals and need contact. The first nights of having a puppy in the home are a time when you need to dispense with your

http://www.wikihow.com/Communicate-With-Your-Dog

30-04-2013

Page 17 of 21

usual distancing from the dog; try to stay near the puppy (such as having its crate in your room), and then gradually moving it to where it will sleep permanently. This will reassure it that all is well. Do not share your bed with it unless you want this to become an ingrained, permanent habit. Doing this creates a permanent expectation in your puppy's mind. Shouting at your dog and/or gesticulating wildly or shaking "weapons" like the broomstick at your dog. This is crazy behavior and does nothing to change your dog's behavior but can certainly upset an already insecure and fearful dog even more (try seeing it from the dog's eye view – not pretty). Spare your energy and stay calm. Always abide by the rule of making the minimum of fuss (also a good rule to have in place with children).

Tips
Take time to learn about your own dog's messaging. As a unique individual, while much of what is written here will be applicable, your dog will also display her own forms of messaging and it is through spending time with your dog that you will get to know her best. If your dog lives in a apartment or doesn't have a yard to go potty off lead , start training the dog to go pee or poo on "command" . This is helpful in poor weather conditions, or busy mornings. teaching the dog to ring a bell hanging from the doorknob is helpful . Remember also movement helps make a bowel movement & a tired dog is a good dog. It is important to note your dog's behavior around other species than humans and other dogs. When introducing other pets into the house, such as cats and rabbits, your dog's reactions are an important indicator as to the success or otherwise of the introduction and being ready to intervene quickly if things get out of hand can mean the safety of either animal is assured. Gradual introductions, careful supervision, and patience all tend to be required when introducing a new pet around a dog that has already established her place. There are many more subtle signs that dogs use to show their anxiety, stress, interest, or other moods. Get to know these signs to help you predict a dog's reactions. Remember, every dog is different. If your dogs personality is passive, you may have passive instead of the neutral results that are stated here. Aggressive dogs will obviously act aggressively, but may be more passive. Every reaction can be different.

Warnings
As clarified in the article's steps, be aware that a wagging tail does not necessarily mean that the dog is friendly or happy. Dogs can wag their tails for many reasons (just as humans can smile or show their teeth for many reasons). If you're not familiar with the dog, always look for other signs that may suggest she is not in the mood for handling or that a swift retreat is in order. Do not force your dog into doing anything, and do not communicate with it in a way that could come off harmful or offensive. Note! Any whine or whimper can mean pain or injury. Do not ignore any sustained whining or whimpering if the cause is not known. Give your dog a thorough check over, and if you still cannot find anything wrong and she continues to voice her unhappiness, see a vet immediately.

This book is a comprehensive study of specialized nutritional needs that vary from breed to breed. This book will show dog owners why dogs taken out of their natural habitat and fed a diet containing food sources unsuitable for their specific systems will develop nutritional allergies. It gives the dog owner a simple solution to this common problem, which can be manifested by body rashes, pigmentation changes, or coat loss. This information also explains why the nutrient source for a commercial allbreed dog food satisfactory for one breed may cause nutritional problems for a different breed of dog.

BASIC NUTRITION

HOW DIFFERENT BREEDS DEVELOPED DIFFERENT NUTRITIONAL NEEDS
It is truly fascinating to see a 235-pound Irish Wolfhound standing beside a 5-pound Pekingese, an Alaskan Malamute, and a Dachshund. When different breeds are standing side by side, it is sometimes hard to comprehend that they all belong to one single species of animal. There are over 250 different breeds within that one single species called canine. Each breed is unique; each differs in its appearance, its temperament, and its nutritional needs. How did these many breeds become so differentiated? To understand the development of the variations found in modern day dogs, we must go back before the time man first became involved with these animals, just a short 10,000 years ago. The actual evolution of modern day dogs began over 40 million years ago! It is by going back and researching dogs' evolution over these last 40 million years that we gain insight into how the modern breeds of today became so differentiated. None of us questions the difference in coats between an arctic breed and a breed from the desert. Most of us also accept the theory of how different breeds developed different coats to survive within a specific environment. In the arctic the extremely low temperatures created a requirement for a thick double coat to protect the dog in its cold climate. In the desert the hot arid temperatures created a requirement for a lighter single coat. Thus, the dog's survival in these different climates dictated the development of a suitable coat. We also should not be surprised to find different nutritional requirements among breeds from different environments. Like the way an environment's climate effected the development of a dog's coat, that same environment effected the development of a dog's nutritional requirements. The native nutrients found in Nordic tundra and ice are different from the nutrients found in the sand of the desert. Therefore, as each type of dog developed within a specific environment, its survival also depended upon the dog's ability to process that environment's food. Thus exposure to different environments produced breeds of dogs with as many variations in nutritional requirements as they have variations in appearance. 1

When comparing two breeds, often the differences can be more easily identified if each breed has remained within a specific type of environment for a prolonged time. For example, comparing exterior differences between any one of the Nordic breeds and the Pharaoh Hound is obvious. The Nordic breeds all developed in cold climates. The Pharaoh Hound developed in the arid regions south of the Mediterranean and was even isolated on a single Mediterranean island for thousands of years. Since we know of this isolation we also can identify the Pharaoh Hound's specific developmental native nutrients. Knowing both the Pharaoh Hound's present nutritional requirements and their native island's specific nutrients, we can see the association between these two known facts. We also can show how this isolation, by limiting the breed to specific nutrients, produced very pronounced breed specific nutritional requirements. With breeds that are new genetic hybrids, it is also possible to identify the environments and the native nutrients that played a role in the creation of their nutritional requirements. However, to accomplish this we must be able to trace their family tree. An example of this would be our tracing the development of the Sealyham Terrier, which was created by Captain John Edwards in the late 1800's. Since Captain Edwards kept very accurate records of his breeding efforts in the development of the Sealyham Terrier, the process of tracing its family tree is easy. With other genetic hybrids this process can be much more difficult, and with some breeds all that can be done is offer an educated guess. When considering the history of nutritional development for the members of the dog family, another lesson we can learn from close inspection of each breed is; be careful not to assume that all dogs from a specific country, as we know it today, have the same nutritional heritage. A dog from China could be from the Mandarin, Hunan, or Szechuan province. A dog from a smaller country, such as Germany, could have come from a mountain environment, middle elevation plateaus, or a lowland area next to the Baltic Sea. A dog from Italy could have come from the Sicilian or the Castilian Province. Within each country there may be different environments. These in turn have their own unique foods. Thus, breeds developing in the different environments of a single country would have developed different nutritional requirements. Also, to believe that all desert breeds or all mountain breeds have the same nutritional needs is wrong. We would have to be more specific: Are the nutrients found in a high desert or a low desert environment? 2

Or if you are referring to the Alps of Germany, Switzerland or France as The Mountains, consider this: The tallest mountain in the French Alps is Mont. Blanc reaching 15,771 feet above sea level. The top of this mountain is lower than the average elevations (16,000 feet above sea level) for the Plateau Area of Tibet. The mountains of Tibet go up from this country's "lower" plateau's to an elevation of over 29,000 feet high. The nutrients found on the mountains of Tibet are very different from the nutrients found on Mont. Blanc. Therefore, when considering the environment where a specific breed of dog developed, we must look beyond the geographic label of mountain, plateau or desert to identify the nutrients from that specific breed's area of origin. Now let us consider the length of time that it would take to make a genetic change, due to an environmental change for any of today's breeds of dog. Man has written about specific breeds of dog for the last 8000 years, but not one word can be found showing that a single breed of dog has changed its genetic make-up due to a change in its environment in all this time. On the other hand many written accounts of breeds show they remain the same, even after prolonged exposure to a new and different environment. One example of non-change after prolonged exposure to a new environment is in the written records of the Whippet. These records indicate the Whippet, which was transported from a hot and dry homeland to England's cold and damp climate in 49 A.D., was very much the same then as today's Whippet. This breed has retained a short sleek coat developed for a hot and dry climate, even after 2,100 years of being bred true in a cold and damp climate. Thus, the Whippet by retaining its short sleek coat, is evidence to us that the length of time it can take to make an evolutionary change due to environmental effect can be over 2,100 years. The length of time needed to make a nutritional requirement change due to exposure to a new environment's food supply also can take thousands of years. This is why today's Alaskan Malamute (a Nordic breed) still thrives on fish, the German Shepherd Dog (a low plains farmland breed) still thrives on beef and grain, and the Greyhound (a desert breed) still thrives on rabbit. These breeds, like all the different breeds removed from their native environment and exposed to a single food supply (i.e.. one processed dog food formula), cannot have their nutritional needs satisfactorily fulfilled. Each breed has retained the genetic differences that it developed in its distinctly different native environments and for this reason, each should be treated NUTRITIONALLY as the individual that it is. 3

Each breed of dog has physical or temeramental characteristics that are different from any other breed.

The question is NOT IF those characteristics affect a breed's nutritional requirements BUT HOW MUCH do they affect a breed's nutritional requirements?

WE SHOULD KNOW: A breed that sheds would need different amounts of coat producing nutrients than a breed that does not shed.

BREED SPECIFIC U. S. GOVERNMENT RESEARCH
In the early 1970's the government’s National Research Council formed
a subcommittee to study the nutritional requirements of dogs. The President at that time was L. B. Johnson. It was at his specific request that this subcommittee was formed and research documentation compiled. Also noteworthy is the fact that the President and his wife Ladybird Johnson owned and raised Beagles. That is why most of the research for the first report by this newly formed subcommittee was related to nutritional requirements of the Beagle. The subcommittee published their report Minimum Nutrient Requirements of Dogs for Growth and Maintenance in 1974. Later in 1980 and again in 1985 their expanded revisions showed tests on more nutrients and used different breeds. In the 1985 revision many multi-breed research studies cited led the committee to state “requirement of the dog can also vary depending on the methods and criteria used in their derivation.” Or lay terms, different breeds of dogs can have different nutrition requirements due to where and how a specific breed developed. In the National Research Council's 1985 report there are many hundred of research studies cited from schools of veterinary medicine, dog food companies, and independent laboratories. Each of these studies pertain to a single nutrient, i.e. vitamin A, calcium, copper, etc. With each research study, when two or more breeds were used, it also showed their nutritional differences. Very noteworthy is the fact that in the entire 1985 report not one research study cited showed two breeds to have the same nutritional requirements for any one nutrient. Samples of specific research confirming breed specific nutritional differences are found throughout the NRC's 1985 revised Nutrient Requirements of Dogs: Specific test that show different breeds of dogs all have different nutritional needs can be seen in tests cited on the following pages: Page 3: “These data illustrate the marked effect on energy requirements 5

imposed by the environment and the additional influence of differences in breed and behavior.” Page 9: Estimates of the protein requirement of the dog can also vary depending on the methods and criteria used in their derivation. Page 11: Blazaet al. (1982) studied the sulfur amino acid requirements of growing Labrador and Beagle dogs in three experiments... These studies indicated that the dogs breed may influence methionine requirements. since Labradors but not Beagles responded to increasing the methionine content from O.36 to 0.71 percent by increased weight gains and food intakes. Page 16: In the section on Calcium... Dogs of some types and breeds may perform satisfactorily on lower intakes of these minerals.’... ‘It is recognized that there are many breeds of dogs, that they are maintained under a wide range of environments, and are being... Page 19: Tinedt et al. (1979) reported a copper toxicosis in Bedlington Terriers fed commercial dog diets containing 5 to 10 mg. copper per kilogram of diet. Ludwig et al. (1980) studied this disease in considerable detail and concluded that it is unique to this breed of dog and is caused by a genetic abnormality. ... The copper requirements for the majority of dog breeds appears to be quite low.’ Page 20: Sanecki et al. (1982) fed English Pointer pups a corn-soy based zinc deficient diet and reported observing within 5 weeks lesions of... These lesions were reversible by adding 200 mg. zinc carbonate per kilogram to the diet, with complete remission of the external lesions in 6 weeks’.... ‘Fisher (1977) fed more than 800 Beagles 32 mg./kg zinc of diet (calcium concentration not noted) and did not report any clinical signs of zinc deficiency. Page 24: Kozelka et a]. (1933) found that Collie puppies were protected from rickets by a ratio 1.3 IU vitamin D (irradiated ergosterol) per kilogram of body weight per day. Amoldand Elvehiem (1939) found calcification to be normal in a growing Airedale puppy receiving a 1.39 percent calcium and a 1.05 percent phosphorus (Ca/ P= 1.32:1) diet and l32 lU or less of vitamin D per kilogram of body weight per day showed that growth and bone mineralization were normal.’ ... “Fleischnrnnn Laboratories (1944) reported that 28 IU vitamin D per kilogram of body weight daily was sufficient for Fox Terriers when using a dietary calcium:phosphorus ratio of 2.1:1. However, even with 270 IU per kilogram of body weight per day, Collies and Great Danes showed X-ray evidence of rickets.” 6

Every few years the Board Members of the National Research Council compiled the research data. They then reviewed all the specific tests. After this review, they recommended the minimum amounts of each nutrient for commercial dog food within the United States. The recommended nutrient amounts are the quantities determined by the committee to sustain life at a safe level and balance for any or all breeds of dog. These recommended amounts are called the “Minimum Nutrient Requirements of Dogs for Growth and Maintenance (amounts per Kilogram of body weight per day)’ or ‘Required Minimum Concentrations of Available Nutrients in Dog Food Formulated for Growth.

Each breed of dog has physical or temeramental characteristics that are different from any other breed.

The question is NOT IF those characteristics affect a breed's nutritional requirements BUT HOW MUCH do they affect a breed's nutritional requirements?

WE SHOULD KNOW: A dog with a coat weighing 10% of its overall weight will need more of the nutrients that grow and maintain coat hair than a dog with a coat weighing 5% of its overall weight.

NUTRITIONAL TEAMWORK
When inspecting each essential nutrient in a dog's diet, it is very important to look at the other nutrients they affect or that affect them. The nutrients that work together are the NUTRITIONAL TEAMS. We all recognize the teamwork between water and solid foods in the dog's diet. If either one is not present, we know the result will be death due to a lack of an essential part of the dog's diet. On the other hand, if we present any one part of the team in quantities that are too far out of proportion to the other parts, we can have the same disastrous results. Balancing all the parts of a nutritional team is the most important factor for formulating a proper diet for any dog. The complete nutritional team for canine nutrition consists of solids and liquids. These can be broken down to include: protein, vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, enzymes, fiber, fatty acids, carbohydrates, bacteria, and water. Then each part of the complete nutritional team can be broken down into a team of its own. The protein team: Protein consists of building blocks called amino acids. It is the balance of ten specific amino acids that give dietary protein its bionutritive value. The ten essential amino acids are; Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Threonine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Tryptophan, Histidine, Argine, and Lysine. All ten of these must be present within the protein for a dog to receive any use of the protein at all. Other amino acids that are considered non essential amino acids are; Alanine, Asparagine, Aspartic Acid, Cystine, Glutamic Acid, Glutamine, Glysine, Proline, Serine and Tyrosine. The non-essential amino acids can be produced by the dog (in vivo) and therefore are not required in the dog's bulk food intake. The essential amino acids are the ones that must be in their food. The vitamin team: There are three types of vitamins required for proper canine nutrition: The water soluble vitamins of B-1, B-2, B-6, B-12, niacin or niacinamide, biotin, folic acid, d-calcium pantothenate, and para amino benzoic acid; The fat soluble vitamins of A, D, and E; and those vitamins like C and K that can be produced by the dog (in vivo) and therefore are not required in the dog's bulk food intake. I also include the nutrients of choline and inositol within the B complex vitamin team. These two nutrients are not considered vitamins. However, they work directly with the water soluble B vitamins and are so closely related that I place them in the same team. 9

The mineral team: The minerals essential for canine nutrition consist of Calcium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, Magnesium, Manganese, Iron, Copper, Iodine, Selenium, and Zinc. The common practice of adding one team member (Calcium) to a dog's diet by pet owners often produces the best example of the danger of imbalancing a nutritional team. This practice provides quantities of calcium that are too far out of proportion to the other team members. There have been many studies done that show adding calcium without the proper balance of the rest of its team mates can deform the skeletal structure in puppies. These studies are those most often used by nutritionists working for dog food companies to show the dangers of supplementing their "balanced" allbreed dog food. This team is also directly linked to the vitamins that are fat soluble and the balance between these two teams is extremely important. The trace mineral team: This team is directly related to both the mineral and vitamin teams. The trace mineral team consists of; Cobalt, Molybdenum, Copper, Fluorine, Iron, Arsenic, Magnesium, Zinc, Chromium, and Manganese. As you can see, many trace minerals appear to be the same as those listed as minerals. The main difference between those with the same name but found in a different category is their molecular configuration. Due to the unique molecular configuration of trace minerals they are very fragile. For example; the simple stone grinding process of wheat flour can cause from 70% to 90% of the natural trace mineral Iron to be destroyed. However, the same process would have little effect on the mineral form of Iron. The enzyme team: The enzyme team consists of Lypase, Amylase, and Trypsin. The dog's Pancreas secretes these enzymes into the intestines where they perform their team functions. Enzymes, like the nonessential amino acids of proteins that are produced by the dog in vivo, are not required in a healthy dog's bulk food intake. However, when supplemental enzymes are required, it is very important that they are manufactured in such a manner as to be released in the proper place within the dog's digestive system. The pancreas secretes its digestive enzymes into the digestive system when the food has already been exposed to several other digestive processes. By the time the food is exposed to the enzymes, the teeth have torn the food into smaller size, the acids and bacteria of the digestive system have started their work on the food, and so forth. 10

Enzymes have very specific duties to perform, and as with all digestive functions, there is a proper time and place for each specific function. When supplemental enzymes are introduced into the digestive process in the wrong place, they can interfere with the functions of individual nutrients or other nutritional teams. The fiber team: The fiber team is one of those teams that is often overlooked. However, the work it performs plays a major function in canine nutrition. Fiber is responsible for slowing the food's movement throughout the digestive system, thus allowing each part of that system the time to perform its function properly. Also fiber and bacteria join in the dogs gut to produce vitamin K. One important thing to consider with fiber is how it differs by source. A wild carnivore may add fiber to its diet by eating the bark of a tree or grasses such as wheat or oats. The major differences here would be that tree bark will not swell in the gut like oats. Oats can swell up to ten times in size when they come into contact with a canine's gastric juices. Note: swelling of fiber can cause a problem if there are large quantities of this fiber from the wrong source in the dog's dietary intake. The swelling can produce a bulk within the intestine, which can impact the system. On the other hand, some sources of fiber that do not swell, like that from tree bark, may not allow the proper growth of bacteria in a dog's gut for that dog's in vivo production of vitamin K. It is very important to match the fiber source in the dietary intake of a dog with sources found in the breed's native environment. The fatty acid team: There are three fatty acids a dog must have to be able to produce the arachidonic acids that its body requires. The three fatty acids are: Oleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, and Linoleic Acid. All three are found together in any natural source containing what is called the AlphaLinolenate family. The classic symptom of a fatty acid deficiency is a dry and brittle coat. The breeds that produce skin oils also will require a different balance of this team than those breeds that do not produce skin oils. The fatty acid team should not be confused with "fat", which is more a source of nutritional carbohydrates. However, some types of animal fats do contain both carbohydrates and small amounts of the fatty acids. Vegetables and grains such as wheat bran, corn, linseed, or soy beans normally contain the highest concentrations of the AlphaLinolenate family. 11

The carbohydrate team: Carbohydrate requirements change at very specific times in a dog's life cycle and in times of stress or work. Canines cannot "carbohydrate stack" (store carbohydrates for energy) as humans can, but they turn carbohydrates from the dietary intake into instant energy. Puppies and geriatric dogs should receive much of their energy from high carbohydrate food rather than from high protein food. Dogs convert high carbohydrate food into energy in a short time after ingesting it. They will need to be fed more often during the day to maintain proper energy levels. Also, in the time of lactation, the bitch will turn some carbohydrates into a very special form of milk sugars for her puppies' energy requirements. Producing energy from dietary carbohydrates can be much easier on the dog's body than the process of producing energy from protein. Protein must be stored in muscle tissue and then withdrawn for conversion into energy. The bacteria team: Like fiber, bacteria is a part of canine nutrition too often taken for granted. A wild carnivore will often bury its kill, after eating the guts (high in bacteria content), to let the carcass rot prior to eating it. This rotting is nothing more than allowing bacteria to break down the muscle tissue to make it more digestible. The bacteria team also works very closely with the fiber team within the digestive system to develop and grow cultures. These cultures in turn produce vitamin K in the dog's gut. New research is now being done with bacteria to study its role in canine nutrition, and its importance is becoming more defined. Note: Bacteria is found throughout the dog's digestive system. Bacteria in the mouth should not be removed by chemicals so that the dog will have sweet smelling breath. This is a human's cultural hang-up, and one that can cause dietary distress in canines by removing a very essential nutritional part from a dog's digestive process. The water team: Water is the most important nutrient team. Water comprises over 60% of a dog's body weight. Deprivation of water causes death faster than deprivation of any other nutrient. Water also works with ALL the other nutrient teams in the performance of their individual or collective functions. Water intake is normally in balance with water loss through the dog's urine, lungs, skin and feces. The loss of water through each method depends on factors such as activity levels, stress levels and the environmental temperatures. Water must be replaced continuously because the loss of water is continuous. 12

This means that the dog must always have access to water. However, not all water is the same. Well water from an area high in soil minerals also will be high in those minerals unless treated. Many cities treat their water supply with chemicals. Each city will use different chemicals and treatment processes depending upon the sources of their water. The end product called "water" may only be similar to "water" from another city for the mere fact it is a liquid. Dogs can develop diarrhea from a sudden change in the sources of any nutrient and water is no exception. Therefore, I recommend you try to provide water from the home source when traveling with a dog. This can be done by taking along water from home or you can acclimate your dog to a specific type of bottled water before the trip. Then all you need to do is buy the same type of bottled water as needed during the trip. There are dangers in breaking down nutritional teams of solid food and liquids into their component parts and in turn further breaking down each of these components. One danger is that a person doing research in the field of nutrition can become too focused on a specific nutrient and disregard how that one nutrient interacts with other nutrients. For example; we all know that it takes calcium to build heathy bones. Knowing this one fact and taking it out of context can lead to problems. Adding lots of calcium to a puppy's food, without the other nutrients calcium interacts with for building bones, can be counter productive. Another danger occurs when the researcher is looking for a specific result. When the researcher achieves his goal, he does not carry on to see what other areas have been effected. The best example of this would be the research on a product to change the elasticity of the muscles holding the hip joint together, thus changing the occurrence of hip dysplasia. Such a product has been researched and is available. However, that product also damages an otherwise healthy dog's liver and kidney. When considering the field of canine nutrition and formulating a proper diet for your dog, I feel that a holistic view must be taken. Therefore, again I will emphasize that I feel the balancing of all the parts of each nutritional team is the most important factor.

Each breed of dog has physical or temeramental characteristics that are different from any other breed.

The question is NOT IF those characteristics affect a breed's nutritional requirements BUT HOW MUCH do they affect a breed's nutritional requirements?

WE SHOULD KNOW: A thick boned breed of dog will need different amounts of the bone building minerals than a thin boned breed of dog.

PROTEIN AND ITS AMINO ACIDS
Protein is one of the most important parts of dog food, as well as one of the least understood by the average dog owner. Most people have the misconception that the amount of protein the food contains is the important factor. However, the important factor is: How much of the food's protein can be used by the animal consuming it? To determine the amount of usable protein, we must first break protein down into its component parts. These parts are called amino acids. There are two classifications for amino acids of dietary protein; (1) essential - those that the dog's own body cannot manufacture in sufficient quantities and (2) non essential - those that the dog's own body can manufacture in sufficient quantities. It is the presence, balance and quality of the essential amino acids that determines the bio-nutritive value (% of usable protein) of the protein in a dog's feeding program. All the amino acids, both essential and non-essential, have very specific nutritional jobs within the dog's body; such as the building of the muscle tissue, the regulation of antibodies within the immune system, and the transfer of nerve impulses etc. The essential amino acids and some of their functions for a dog are: ARGININE: This essential amino acid stimulates immune system response by enhancing the production of T-cells, has a protective effect of toxicity of hydrocarbons and intravenous diuretics, is related to the elevated ammonia levels and cirrhosis of the liver by detoxifying ammonia, and induces growth hormone release from the pituitary gland. HISTIDINE: This essential amino acid releases histamines from body stores, is associated with pain control, is associated with arthritis, and widens small blood vessels; thus aiding early digestion by stimulating stomach acid secretion. ISOLEUCINE and LEUCINE: see VALINE LYSINE: This essential amino acid promotes bone growth in puppies, stimulates secretion of gastric juices, and is found in abundance within muscle tissue, connective tissue, and collagen. 15

METHIONINE: This essential amino acid assists gall bladder functions by participating in the synthesis of blue salts, helps to prevent deposits and cohesion of fats in the liver due to lipotropic function, is related to the synthesis of choline, balances the urinary tract pH (in its dl form), and gives rise to Taurine (an important neuroregulator in the brain). PHENYLALANINE: This essential amino acid stimulates chaleceptokinin enzymes and thus is related to appetite control, increases blood pressure in hypotension, works with minerals in skin and hair pigmentation, gives rise to Tyrosine, and produces adrenaline and noradrenalin. THREONINE: This essential amino acid regulates energy draw requirements, works with Phenylalanine in mood elevation or depression and skin pigmentation, manufactures adrenaline, and precurses Thyroid hormone. TRYPTOPHAN: This essential amino acid produces Serotonin that induces sleep, precurses the vitamin Niacin in treating and preventing pellagra, and is a vasoconstrictor that appears to aid in blood clotting mechanisms. Studies indicate a lack of tryptophan and methionine together can cause hair loss. VALINE, (ISOLEUCINE AND LEUCINE): These essential amino acids work together and are classified as "branched-chain" amino acids. The three combine to regulate the protein turnover and energy metabolism, are stored in muscle tissue, and are released to be converted into energy during times of fasting or between meals. Listed above are the ten amino acids that are essential for a dog's dietary requirements. Note humans only require eight essential amino acids in our dietary intake, and for this reason a dog could starve if given the same protein sufficient to sustain human life. Other factors to consider concerning a specific dog's protein requirements are: (1) The age of a dog can change its protein requirements. Both puppies and geriatric dogs require lower amounts of protein and higher carbohydrate %'s in their food. (2) The dog's activity level or stress level (due to environment or working conditions) can change its protein requirements. (3) A bitch during the gestation and lactation period has her own very specific requirements. 16

(4)The other ingredients within the food can affect the amount of each amino acid required. For example, a food that is highly acidic (due to a preservative) can increase the requirement of the amino acid Methionine. The problem of selecting the proper protein blend for a specific dog can be very confusing but can be simplified by applying this single rule: When choosing the protein blend that is best for a specific breed of dog look for the protein sources that were in that specific breed's native environment and then match them as closely as possible. When considering an environment's protein sources you should take many factors into consideration. First, with the environment's meat protein sources you should remember to look beyond labels such as cattle before assuming that they are describing beef. In some parts of the world the term cattle can be referring to a herd of goats, water buffalos, or reindeer. Cattle may not always mean beef from the state of Texas. Also with each protein source the amino acid balance can be different depending upon the environment from which we take our sample. When testing food sources, we find that herring from the Pacific Ocean has a different amino acid profile than herring from the Atlantic Ocean. Also, Texas longhorn cattle produces beef with a different amino acid profile than Pennsylvania dairy cattle beef. Second, consider all the protein sources of the area to establish if that environment's meat protein is the type of protein that is best for a specific breed. For example; The Chow Chow developed in an area of China where meat is available as a dietary source of protein. However, the meat source of protein was the Chow Chow and it was available to the humans. The Chow was fed grains to produce a tender and nicely marbled meat for the human's table. This breed's development as a vegetarian also explains why today's Chow Chow has the jaw and flat tooth structure of a grain eater. Also, why today's Chow Chow has a body with a high fat to low muscle fiber ratio. Therefore, after considering all the factors for a Chow Chow's dietary protein, it may be best to use only the vegetable sources of protein found in its native environment. Third, the amount of each protein source used in a single dog food becomes important since the amount of each source found in a specific environment can be quite different. A breed that developed in an environment that had few grain crops would need less grain in their food 17

than a breed that developed in an area where grain protein comprised the bulk of their dietary protein intake. Fourth, the blend of protein sources is important since different sources of dietary protein contain different amounts of both the essential and non-essential amino acids. For example, equal amounts of lamb meat, beef, fish, chicken, or horse meat from the same environment will contain different amounts of essential amino acids. Sources such as soy, corn, rice, beet, wheat, and alfalfa also contain very specific amounts of essential and non-essential amino acids in their protein. The following two tables show how different protein food sources can provide different amounts or types of protein. Table P-1: The differences in protein and fat ratios of different meat sources from different areas of the world. Food source:

FAT CARBOHYDRATES AND FATTY ACIDS
There are differences between the dog and human in their use of carbohydrates. This includes the use of different forms of carbohydrates from starch or sugar. For example; we know sugar forms of lactose, dextrose or glucose are all different as dietary sources of carbohydrates. These can be stored or used as an instant energy supply by a human. Also, we know how a human stores carbohydrates from some starch sources better than sugar sources for future energy requirements. Only the human can store dietary carbohydrates for later conversion into energy. Canines turn all dietary carbohydrates, from any source, into instant energy, and none is stored for energy requirements that develop later. Also, for all types of dogs, all forms of sugar carbohydrates have been found to be detrimental, except for lactose found in the milk of a lactating bitch for her puppy. Please Note; this form of lactose is not the same as a synthetic lactose from sugar beet or sugar cane or even the lactose found in the milk of other species of mammals. Like the sugar carbohydrates of lactose, glucose and dextrose being different, carbohydrates found in animal fat, vegetable and grain sources (soy bean, beet pulp, wheat, rice, potatoes or corn) are all different. These differences are important. One study cited in the NRC publication Nutrient Requirements of Dogs shows that the digestible fat from one source provides 2.25 times the metabolizable energy concentration of digestible carbohydrate than from a second source. Another study cited showed different breeds of dog need different amounts of carbohydrates or different carbohydrate to protein ratios in their food. Therefore, if your dog is requiring a high carbohydrate diet due to breed requirements or life-style, you need to provide those carbohydrates in the proper amount and from the proper source. When you are considering which food source of carbohydrates contains the proper form for your dog, you should consider the type of food sources that were in the native environment for your breed. Then also remember to eliminate those sources that would have been foreign to that breed's native environment. A dog breed from Ireland, where potatoes or flax were common dietary sources of carbohydrates, would not have been exposed to rice. 19

Yet a dog breed from China could have been exposed to several different types of rice that were grown as common sources of dietary carbohydrates in its environment. A dog breed from a mountain environment, where both vegetable and grain crops are scarce, could have a different need for its carbohydrate source as well. Some mountain breeds of dog may not utilize potato or rice carbohydrate any better than a sugar, but best use an animal fat form of carbohydrate. Animal fat is one of the most common carbohydrate sources found in commercial dog food and because a food contains animal fat, it is often assumed it is providing dietary fatty acids. Normally this is not so since animal fat in dog food is exposed to extremely high temperatures during processing procedures. The high temperature can eliminate the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of the rendered fat. In many cases manufacturers use separate food sources to provide fat carbohydrates and polyunsaturated fatty acids in their foods. The better commercial dog food manufacturers use grain or vegetable oils that have been cold pressed or processed to retain the needed polyunsaturated fatty acids. These cold pressed grain and vegetable oils still contain the fatty acids known as the alpha-Linolenate family. There are three fatty acids that make up the entire alpha-Linolenate family; oleic acid, linolenic acid, and linoleic acid. With breeds that produce skin oil, the requirement for the oleic acid part of the alpha-Linolenate family is higher than with the breeds that do not produce skin oils. However, it is essential for all dogs to receive all three of these fatty acids to produce the arachidonic acids they all require. Since these fatty acids are a complete nutritional team, they should be listed on labels in the same way that manufacturers of premium foods list the amino acid content of their food's protein. Manufacturers who list all three on the label provide you with a more accurate statement of the package contents. This labeling practice enables you to choose more intelligently the proper food for your specific breed of dog. In processed dog foods animal fat should be considered as only a source of dietary carbohydrates. After the rendering process, it contains very little of the alpha-Linolenate fatty acids. A complete diet for most breeds of dog should contain both animal fat and a source containing the alpha-Linolenate family of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Do not assume fatty acids are present just because the dog food label has fat listed. The finished product may or may not have any fatty acids. Commercial food manufacturers may add animal fat just for its carbohydrate content or to make it more palatable for most canines. 20

Also do not assume that the product contains all three of the fatty acids of the alpha-Linolenate family if the label only lists Linoleic acid. This one fatty acid can be purchased separately as a raw material for dog food. Table F-1: The following table shows relative comparisons for some common commercial dog food fat and fatty acid sources.
alpha-Linolenate Fatty Acids Food source
Rendered Chicken fat Rendered Beef fat Rendered Pork fat Cold pressed Linseed oil Cold pressed Wheat germ oil Cold pressed Soy bean oil oleic acid under 0.1% under 0.1% under 0.1% 36% 30% 26% linolenic acid under 0.1% under 0.1% under 0.1% 11.4% 10.8% 11.0% linoleic acid under 0.1% under 0.1% under 0.1% 42.5% 44.1% 49.0%

Both carbohydrates and fatty acids are important and both must be provided in dog foods. However, you must use a source of carbohydrates or fatty acids that can be assimilated by the breed of dog you are feeding. An indicator that your dog is rejecting food carbohydrates from sugar, grains, vegetables or animal fat in the food is persistent diarrhea. The indicator that your dog is not assimilating the fatty acids is a loss of coat shine or a loss in the skin's elasticity. Therefore, it is easy for the dog owner to see a dietary carbohydrate or fatty acid nutritional problem. Conversely, it is also easy to see when foods are supplying the proper sources and amounts of these important nutrients.

21

Each breed of dog has physical or temeramental characteristics that are different from any other breed.

The question is NOT IF those characteristics affect a breed's nutritional requirements BUT HOW MUCH do they affect a breed's nutritional requirements?

WE SHOULD KNOW: A black / thick / long / double coat will filter out the suns ultraviolet light differently than a white / thin / short / single coat. & Because the sun's ultraviolet light manufactures vitamin D on a dog's skin that different breeds can have different requirements for this one nutrient.

INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONS OF VITAMINS & MINERALS
Vitamin A Important for healthy skin, hair, eyes, and normal bone growth. Vitamin B-1 Essential in the metabolism of carbohydrates and protein. Deficiency causes heart and nerve disease. Vitamin B-2 Essential for normal growth, healthy skin and hair. It has been used as a natural aid in coping with stress. Vitamin B-6 Essential for normal blood, nerves and growth, and metabolism of protein. Vitamin B-12 Important in the development and maintenance of normal blood cells. Vitamin D Needed to assimilate the calcium and phosphorous in the development of normal teeth and bones. Vitamin E Protects against effects of oxidized or unstable fats in diet. It is important for reproduction and helps the body use Vitamin A. Niacinamide Helps to maintain the integrity of mouth tissue and the nervous system and is essential in converting food to energy. Biotin Present as a member of the B Complex in nature and is associated with normal growth, healthy skin and hair. Folic Acid A hematopoietic vitamin, used for normal blood, growth and health of the fetus. d-Calcium Pantothenate Required for the formation of certain hormones and nerve-regulating substances and to maintain the proper level of blood sugars.

Supplementing
Webster's New World Dictionary defines supplement: (sup. ple. ment) as: something added, esp. to make up for a lack or deficiency. Supplementing is a two edged sword; there is good supplementing and there is bad supplementing. All dog food manufacturers add various ingredients to their foods during the manufacturing process so that the end product contains levels that meet industry standards. For example, to make protein that dogs can use the manufacturer may add various protein sources that have one or more of the essential amino acids. They do this until they have a protein blend that contains all ten essential amino acids. Thus, by the process defined as supplementing, the dog food company manufactures a food that will have nutritional value. The same supplementing is done to achieve nutritional levels of vitamins, minerals and other ingredients in all commercially manufactured dog food. Most foods are brought to levels that have been established by the government National Research Council (NRC) as the Minimum Nutrient Requirements of Dogs. When dog food companies have added ingredients to reach NRC recommended levels, they have also reached the industry standards to advertise the food as "complete and balanced." These NRC or "complete and balanced" levels are also established to provide safe levels for all dogs. For example, the NRC subcommittee recommends that dog foods supply 8 IU of vitamin D per kilogram of a dog's body weight. This is 8 IU/kg. for any breed of dog's body weight, even though tests cited in a NRC publication show that some breeds require higher amounts of vitamin D (up to 270 IU/kg.). Since vitamin D is a "fat soluble" vitamin, overdoses of this vitamin are dangerous. If manufacturers added enough vitamin D to meet the higher requirements of the few breeds that require 270 IU/kg., the food would actually be toxic to the many breeds who only require 8 IU/kg. The dog food companies take care to not exceed the safe all-breed levels of any nutrient that could be harmful to a breed. They have no control over which breed of dog will consume their food. 25

Many studies show that any supplementing of a single nutrient to safe "complete and balanced" dog food levels can be dangerous. Some examples are: A) Excess supplemental calcium can block the assimilation of the copper, iron, phosphorus and zinc in the dietary intake. B) Excess supplemental vitamin A (a fat soluble vitamin) can decalcify the teeth and bones and cause liver damage. C) Any supplemental vitamin C can cause a detrimental pH change in the kidney and cause a healthy liver to lose its ability to function properly. D) Excess supplemental vitamin D (a fat soluble vitamin) can block calcium assimilation or collect in the glands to levels that can be toxic. E) Any supplemental fluoride or fluorine can mottle tooth enamel during the period of calcification of permanent teeth in dogs. It also can block the assimilation of dietary trace minerals and alter the dog's natural ability to produce vitamin K. F) Any supplemental thyroid can cause a healthy thyroid gland to lose its ability to function properly. Supplementing can be dangerous when any one nutrient is added in quantities that negatively affect how the dog's body reacts to the other nutrients in the same nutritional complex, or when by supplementing we change or take over the function of a vital organ. To avoid potential dangers, most dog food companies make a blanket recommendation that you do not supplement their foods. When dog food companies recommend that you do not supplement their food, they are correct . . . about 50% correct! What they haven't told you is that there is another side to the issue. The side that shows that the safe all-breed levels they have in their all-breed foods are not sufficient nutritional amounts for all dogs. The safe allbreed amounts may be enough to keep any dog alive. But the safe allbreed amounts will not provide the correct amounts or balance to sustain optimum health for some breeds of dogs. All-breed foods, even though they contain nutritional levels that allow them to be classified by industry standards as "complete and balanced", also must be supplemented above these levels to provide proper nutrition for most dogs. 26

Dog owners may recognize their animals are not in the optimum of health because the all-breed foods they are using are lacking the proper nutrient amounts for their dogs. Then with the best intentions, they may choose to ignore the dog food companies' recommendations about supplementing and experiment with their dogs dietary intake. Experimenting with supplements usually produces negative, or at best, limited results. Supplementing dog food is a complicated process. It is possible to do it correctly at the time of manufacturing, if the manufacturer is making a breed specific food. There is only one way that dog foods should be supplemented during the manufacturing process: Step one is to calculate the nutritional requirements of the specific breed of dog that will be eating that food. Step two is to determine which sources of each nutrient have the proper molecular formation for that breed of dog to assimilate. Step three is to find food bases with these sources. Step four is to acquire quantities of the nutrients from the proper sources. Step five is to blend the proper amount of each of these nutrients to bring the levels and balances in the finished food to the proper levels and balances for that specific breed of dog's requirements. It is also possible to supplement a premanufactured all-breed formula correctly. Step one is to calculate the nutritional requirements of the specific breed of dog involved. Step two is to determine which sources of each nutrient have the proper molecular formation for this breed of dog to assimilate. 27

Step three is to find a premanufactured all-breed formula with these sources. Step four is to analyze the bulk food to determine what levels are already present. Step five is to acquire quantities of the additional nutrients needed (these also must be from the proper sources). Step six is to blend the proper amount of each of these additional nutrients to bring the levels and balances in the final food blend to the proper levels and balances for that specific breed of dog's requirements.

But here I caution you: Do not compound the problems that now exist in feeding a safe but nutritionally inadequate all-breed dog food by supplementing it with an unsafe or imbalanced all-breed supplement.

28

NUTRIENTS BENEFICIAL TO HUMANS . . . BUT . . . HARMFUL TO DOGS
There are many nutritional similarities between a dog and a human, but we also have many differences. The human has an average of 32 permanent teeth (with structural differences depending on the race). The dog has an average of 42 permanent teeth (with structural differences depending on the breed). The human has a long gastrointestinal tract consisting of both a large and a small intestine. The dog has a short gastrointestinal tract consisting of a single colon. Similar glands found within both humans and canines are located differently within their respective digestive systems and some glands, such as the liver, perform different functions. The human has starch breaking enzymes in the saliva, the dog does not. The human can store carbohydrates for energy, the dog cannot. The human can receive bio-nutritive value from protein containing 8 essential amino acids, the dog requires 10 essential amino acids to receive bio-nutritive value. A stimulant in chocolate called theobromine can be deadly for dogs but not for humans. Etc. Because of the differences, there are certain nutrients beneficial when they are in a human's dietary intake that can be harmful in a dog's dietary intake. Two of the most common nutrients I have found in commercial canine dietary products that fall into this category are Fluorine and Vitamin C. Fluorine: Fluorine, as sodium fluoride, was added to the water of most commercial sources within the U.S. after extensive research showed that it hardened the tooth enamel in children and thus helped to prevent tooth decay. However, the same type of research has been performed on the dog, with the results being quite different. To find some research with fluorine and canines we need to look into the history books. In 1936 (Biester et. al.) conducted research showing that the addition of fluorine to the water supply of canines caused mottling of the tooth enamel during the period of calcification of the permanent teeth. In 1959 (Andreeva) reported findings that the addition of fluorine at 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight daily for 92 days to the diet of month-old pups altered serum calcium and inorganic and organic phosphorus concentrations significantly. 29

There are many other tests that show fluorine can cause many nutritionally related problems. Fluorine should not be included within the dietary intake of any breed of dog. Therefore, I suggest that you filter the dog's water supply to eliminate the fluorine. This can be done by adding an inexpensive filter to the water supply for the kennel. By properly locating the filter you can remove the fluorine from the dog's water while leaving the fluorine in the main water supply to meet the human's needs. Vitamin C: Vitamin C is an essential nutrient for all mankind. However, one of the most common errors when looking at this one vitamin is to think that all vitamin C is the same. Often vitamin C is referred to as ascorbic acid, or vice versa, even though ascorbic acid is only one form of vitamin C. Ascorbic acid is the most common synthetic form used in the U. S. and is also found in both a "L" and a "D" form. Since the "D" form is unsafe for human use, only the "L" form is sold commercially. L. Pauling in his book VITAMIN C AND THE COMMON COLD discusses both the "L" and "D" forms of ascorbic acid. THE MERCK INDEX, an encyclopedia of chemicals and drugs, also lists these two forms The three most common synthetic forms of vitamin C sold in the U. S. are Ascorbic Acid (C6H8O6), Calcium Ascorbate (C12H14CaO12), and Sodium Ascorbate (C6H7NaO6). Note that the molecular forms within the ( )'s are all different. In addition, none of these forms are the same as the natural vitamin C found in fresh fruit. They also differ from the vitamin C that a dog and certain other animals can manufacture within their glandular systems. Another common error associated with vitamin C is to assume that the human and the dog are both the same in their dietary need of this nutrient. A very basic difference between dogs and humans is found in their glandular systems. Using the trace mineral form of Cobalt as the primary element, when all the other trace minerals are present within their diet, the dog's liver has the ability to synthesize the cobalt to produce the vitamin C that its body requires. The human glandular system is not capable of producing its own vitamin C. For this reason, it is essential for humans, but not dogs, to include vitamin C in their 30

As an interesting side light I note: The source of the vitamin C that a human should use in their dietary intake also can be an important factor. A recent study conducted by the University of Oregon (1987), discovered that the American Eskimo people are unable to use the synthetic forms of vitamin C. This includes ascorbic acid, or even those natural forms found in fresh fruit to prevent the onset of scurvy. However, they are able to prevent scurvy by eating seal blubber that contains a special and unique molecular form of vitamin C. The seal produces this form of vitamin C in much the same way that a dog does by synthesizing trace minerals in the liver. The seal then stores this "fat soluble" form of vitamin C in the blubber, just under the skin. This fat soluble form, which is stored in seal blubber, is also different in its molecular structure than ascorbil palmitate, a commercial synthetic "fat soluble" vitamin C. Research done with dogs documenting their vitamin C requirements is readily available. For example, the government has published the results from research projects with vitamin C in their 1985 revision of the NRC NUTRIENT REQUIREMENTS OF DOGS. On pages 37 and 38 of the NRC publication they cite twenty five carefully controlled studies. An excerpt says: "and some veterinary practitioners apparently advocate vitamin C for - - -", and continues "- - - conducted some carefully controlled studies concerned with these issues and established that exogenous vitamin C was of no benefit. " One controlled study cited in the NRC showed that supplemental vitamin C aggravated skeletal disease in Labrador Retriever puppies. From these controlled studies the government subcommittee on animal nutrition states: "It is concluded that there is no adequate evidence to justify recommendation of routine vitamin C additions to the diet of the normal dog." Other studies have shown that supplemental vitamin C from the ascorbic acid source can create a pH imbalance in the dog's kidney. This is due to ascorbic acid, which is "water soluble", being discharged through the kidney. These studies also show where this change in the urinary tract pH can negatively affect the use of many other essential nutrients. Another negative aspect of giving vitamin C to a healthy dog is the risk taken when we replace one of the functions of a healthy dog's liver (producing the vitamin C that its own body requires).

31

By adding vitamin C to the dog's diet we can cause the dog's liver to stop working as it should. This can best be equated to feeding thyroid medication to a dog with a normal thyroid gland. The Morris Animal Foundation in 1987 released the findings of a survey determining the main causes of dogs' deaths in the United States. The second and sixth leading causes cited in that report were kidney disorders and liver failure. I cannot help but wonder at the connection between these statistics and the use of ascorbic acid in dog food or dog food supplements. Even after all the negative test results cited by the National Research Council, many dog food manufacturers still add ascorbic acid to their dog foods. These test results have been confirmed by companies within the dog food industry itself. One company; Gains Pet Food Corp., has published a book titled BASIC GUIDE TO CANINE NUTRITION. On page 21 in their fifth edition of that book they state: "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is not required in the diet of dogs as it is in the diets of primates, guinea pigs, bats and some fish, birds, and insects. The dog and other animals are able to synthesize this vitamin." Why do many dog food manufacturers have ascorbic acid in their foods? The reason is ascorbic acid is an antioxidant. As an antioxidant, ascorbic acid is a commonly used cheap preservative that has been used for years to keep foods fresh, color additives bright, and to keep the fats within the foods from going rancid. It is a cheap preservative that most people can assimilate. Therefore, people formulating dog foods, who do not know there is a nutritional difference between dogs and humans, assume it to be a "safe" preservative. The other scenario is that it is being used by people formulating dog foods who are aware of the harm it can do. But these people are more concerned about keeping the colors in their food bright and appealing for the buyer, rather than the actual health of the dogs that are eating it. Manufacturers of commercial dog foods must remember that when formulating a food for dogs, the finished food product is for a dog and not for human consumption. The dog and the human are two different species of animal. We may have similarities, but we also have our differences. Therefore, the food should provide the nutrients that a dog requires and should not contain nutrients that can be detrimental to the animal for which it is formulated. 32

TRUSTING LABELS
Buyer Beware! You could be feeding your dog poultry feathers or sawdust. These ingredients are often listed on a label so that you think you are getting real chunks of poultry meat or beef. Most dog food labels can be confusing or misleading to the average lay person, though the labels may be technically correct by government standards. When you consider the competitive dog food market in the U.S.A., you can see why the manufacturers want to have the most appealing packaging possible. They also need to formulate their products to be price competitive. To do this, many manufacturers buy their ingredients from the cheapest source - not necessarily the best source. Most cheaper sources used are "feed grade" or "animal grade" food products. Feed grade products commonly used in commercial dog foods are corn husk, peanut shells, oat middlings, poultry feathers, sawdust and fish heads with skin. These have their own set of government label requirements. Unless you are familiar with the government list of feed grade products and their labeling requirements, odds are you will be confused or even misled by the label terms used. Much of the confusion is because there are nutritional products made for human consumption, from high quality ingredients, that have similar sounding labeling terms. When we read a label on food products for an animal we assume that if it sounds the same it must be the same. NOT SO! For example, when dog food labels show protein as an ingredient, we may assume that the protein has food value equal to the percentage of protein listed. However, not all protein is nutritionally usable protein. It is protein! Protein that can be shown on the label because it can be determined by a simple nitrogen analysis. Both the federal government and dog food industry use this analysis to confirm the label claim for protein. But according to this nitrogen analysis, the plastic of your telephone or the paint on your wall also contains protein. As far fetched as it sounds, these protein sources could be used in dog food and the food could be sold as a "High Protein Food." NOTE: Present labeling laws for dog foods require that they show the amount of protein content. The requirements do not ask for a break down of the protein for its amino acid content or its bio-nutritive value. Many low food value - high protein feed grade sources are used in commercial dog foods. Often they are listed on the label as a "meal " or "by-products ." 33

Webster defines by-product as: anything produced in the course of making another thing; secondary or incidental product or result. The production of meat for human consumption also produces meat meal and meat by-products used in dog food. It is important to note that there is not necessarily any meat in the products that are put into dog food and labeled as a "by-product ", there also may be very little meat in the product labeled as "meal ." For example, when the slaughter house scrapes the hair and viscera from the hide before sending it to be tanned for leather products, they save this for dog foods that use meat by-products. Another meat by-product is sawdust from the floor of the packing house. The sawdust on the floors of a butchering plant catches the blood and viscera during the butchering process and keeps the floors from getting slippery. Therefore, the blood soaked sawdust has become a meat by-product. The by-product of poultry meat production is feathers. On pages 48 through 61 of the NRC's 1985 publication Nutrient Requirements of Dogs there is a list of ingredients found in dog food, including their international feed numbers. For example on page 60 under Poultry, entries 109-111: feathers, hydrolyzed (international feed number 5-03-795) can be listed on a label as Poultry by-product ; necks with backs and wings with legs, fresh (international feed number 5-03-797) can be listed on a label as Poultry meal ; trimmings fresh (international feed number 5-16-424) can be listed on a label as Poultry or Poultry meat . Obviously, Poultry meat is what we want and what we hope we are getting when reading a dog food label listing poultry as a food source. However, you should remember to read the entire listing. If the word by-product is used the food is just that - a by-product ! Food product manufacturers who are meeting government labeling regulations must list the ingredients on product labels showing what the product contains. This is done under a heading entitled Guaranteed Analysis or Ingredients on the label. Yet representatives for dog food manufacturers have often told me that the food they make contains real poultry meat though the label states that it contains Poultry by-products. Government agencies check the printed label. If they lie on the label the government can take the product off the market shelves. Therefore, I suggest that we trust the printed word more than a sales representative's claims. 34

Most dog food manufacturers would not label their product showing a by-product food source if they could show the product was made with a source that was better. Remember that the dog food manufacturer, in most cases, is meeting the federal label law requirements. Also remember that when buying a dog food product it is "buyer beware." It is your responsibility to know how to look beyond a fancy ad or the misleading name on the front of the package. It is up to you to know that "meaty flavored" or "looks just like real meat" does not mean there is any meat in the product. Most dog food manufacturers also use the MISLEADING CLAIM that their dog food is "complete and balanced." The claim "complete and balanced" means that the manufacturer has met certain all-breed minimums or industry standards. The claim of "complete and balanced" means that the food contains the complete number and balance of nutrients the government suggested dog food should have as a minimum. The claim of "complete and balanced" does not mean that a food is nutritionally complete or nutritionally balanced for the requirements of the dog that is eating it. If you have any questions about your specific dog and the food it is eating you should be able to ask the dog food manufacturer. There is a way to do this: For the consumer's protection the federal label laws require that manufacturers of food products include on their label the name and postal zip code of the manufacturer or responsible distributor. The company listed on the label also must maintain a listed telephone number in the area that corresponds to the postal zip code on the label. There must be a responsible person available at that number to answer any questions that a government inspector would want to ask. This is the person you should talk to, not just a sales person or receptionist. When you get through to this person do not accept a long answer that doesn't tell you anything. Ask questions that can be answered by a yes or no and demand clear concise answers. For example, "Does your product contain sugar?" can be answered by a simple yes or no. Yet when I asked that question to the person in charge of Quality Control for a manufacturer of a well known dog food supplement, I was told: "If you tested our products you could find traces of carbohydrates." 35

The fact was, when tested, their product was 92% sugar. However, the sugar in this product is considered a "filler." The government label regulations do not require this "filler" to be listed. Therefore, it was legally not shown on their label. Also, we bought this product from a veterinary clinic. Which brings me to another touchy subject; Who can you trust to give you good information based on KNOWLEDGE? An alarming fact is canine nutrition is not adequately covered in the curriculum of most schools of veterinary medicine. A 1989 survey showed that the average school of veterinary medicine in the United States donated approximately five classroom hours, one hour per day for five day's, on all-animal nutrition in their curriculum requirements to obtain a D. V. M.. There are exceptions, so here again, you should ask where and how the person giving you nutritional advice gained their knowledge. If they gained their knowledge by attending seminars put on by dog food companies, and they are selling that brand of dog food, then it is BUYER BEWARE. However, if they are among the conscientious veterinarians who have taken it upon themselves to study animal nutrition from an unbiased source, you have found a gem. When you are asking for nutritional information about a product from anyone, consider if the person you are asking is trying to make money by selling you a product. Then consider if they may be biassing the information that they are giving you.

Trust the PRINTED word
BUT READ THE ENTIRE LABEL!

DO NOT ASSUME! . . . . . . .ASK! IT IS UP TO YOU TO FIND OUT! THE RESPONSIBILITY BELONGS TO NOBODY ELSE!

YOU CAN ONLY TRUST YOURSELF!

LABEL WORDING DEFINITIONS
One pet food company advertises their food as better than a cheaper food because the main ingredient in their food is poultry meat and (according to the ad) the cheaper foods are made with feathers. But when we read the labels on all the different pet foods we can’t find “feathers” listed as an ingredient in any of them. The company advertising their food is made with poultry meat even has the same ingredients listed on their label as those cheaper foods. Who are we to trust? The words used on pet food labels can bide many evils. They are sometimes misunderstood, often ignored and can be confusing. To limit confusion when listing each ingredient in a food, all pet food companies should be required to also use the International Feed Number (IFN) that has been assigned to each feed grade ingredient. Then we could clearly identify the ingredients in each pet food and be able to make intelligent choices amongst them. Today, words used in the ingredient list can be hiding what is really in the food. Things like feathers, sawdust and dehydrated pig excreta all have IFNs that would identify them. Current regulations allow ingredients like these to be put in pet food and labeled with wording so you don’t know they are in there.” To help you determine what may be in the pet food you are now buying, here are definitions of some words that can be found on most pet food labels today: By-product: An ingredient produced in the course of making a primary food ingredient a secondary or incidental product. Feathers are a by-product of poultry meat processing. Feathers which are removed from a carcass during production of poultry meat are then hydrolyzed (pressure cooked with steam until they are an edible gel) which makes them an acceptable feed grade ingredient. Hydrolyzed feathers have been assigned the (IFN) International Feed Number 5-03-795 and can appear on a label as “Poultry By-products.” On page 158 in the AAFCO book, Official Publication, 1994, Association of American Feed Control Officials Incorporated, they show: Hydrolyzed Poultry By-Products Aggregate is the product resulting from heat treatment, or a combination thereof, of all by-products of slaughter poultry, clean and undecomposed, including such parts as heads, feet, underdeveloped eggs, intestines, feathers and blood.” The IFN assigned to this mix is 5-14-508. 37

Today’s regulations allow the entire mix or any part of it to appear on a label as “Poultry By-products.” A “Fish By-product” can contain heads, tails, intestines and blood. This fish process residue has been assigned the IFN 5-07-977. A “Meat By-product” could be viscera and blood soaked sawdust from the floors of a packing house where meat is being processed. The meat being processed can be lamb, beef, horse, or any other source. Each one has its own IFN. Some of the animal feed IFN’s that contain wood shavings from the floor of a processing facility include “Dried Ruminant Waste” #1-07-526, and “Undried Processed Animal Waste Products” #5-02-790. It is important to note that the amount of wood shavings in either of these two “Meat By-products” is limited and should not be more than 35% in one and 40% in the other. When a pet food label’s list of ingredients shows the word By-product you can be assured that there is NO measurable amount of meat in the ingredient. If the ingredient contained enough meat that it could be measured the pet food company would proudly list the MEAT, not just the By-product of that meat’s production. Mill Run: An ingredient consisting of residue left after the primary food product has been extracted during a milling process. A “Corn Mill Run” would be a pulverized blend of the corn husk and cobs which are left after a milling process has removed the kernels. Mill Run is the vegetable or produce equivalent of meat’s by-product. Digest:. An animal feed-grade ingredient that must be made soluble with the use of heat and moisture. Since these ingredients are not soluble in their natural state they require this manufacturing process before they can be put into pet food. An example of this would be the feet of poultry IFN 5-07-947. When a pet food label shows “Poultry Digest” as an ingredient this could be what is in the food. Meal: A ground or pulverized composite of animal feed-grade ingredients. A good definition of a Meal is provided by AAFCO. They define Poultry By-product Meal: Poultry By-product Meal consists of the ground, rendered, clean parts of the carcass of slaughtered poultry, such as necks, feet, undeveloped eggs, and intestines, exclusive of feathers, except in such amounts as might occur unavoidably in good processing practices. The IFN for this blend is 5-03-795. The only MEAT that 38

might be in “Poultry By-product Meal’ 5-03-795 is what could be left on the necks after becoming clean rendered By-products of meat production. This is not enough that the amount of meat can even be measured and thus have an ingredient listing showing any POULTRY MEAT to be in the food. You should be aware that when a food’s ingredient panel list a product with the word ‘Meal ‘that the word ‘Meal i~ not a synonym for ‘Meat.” The word Meal only means that the product has been ground or pulverized. Gluten: The sticky substance in wheat or corn starch that gives the starch its tough elastic quality. It is used to hold together the pulverized composite of animal feed-grade ingredients. Digestibility Test: A test to see how much ~me it takes a food solid to break down in a strong laboratory acid. There are companies that are claiming the food which passes this test in the shortest amount of time provides the best nutrition for all animals. But the word digestibility is nota synonym for the word nutritious. Just because a food solid can be broken down in an acid does not mean the animal eating it can nutritionally use that kind of food. Not all dogs or cats have the same nutritional acceptance of any one food source. Since pet foods are made from many different food sources we could thus be making the proverbial comparison between apples and oranges. It would be a mistake to judge any food’s total nutritive value on one test demonstrating how fast it breaks down in laboratory acid. Comparing pet foods by using a Digestibility Test is valid only if the foods being tested are of equal nutritional value for the animal that will be eating them. Then the faster a food breaks down the easier it is for the animal’s digestive system to make use of it. If you are now buying a pet food with words you don’t understand on the label you might try this: contact the manufacturer and ask them for their definitions. If they do not give them to you in words you, the buyer, can understand then maybe it’s time to consider home cooking your pet’s food. You’d know what was in the food, and for thousands of years before commercial pet food was available (just 85 years ago), that’s what pet owners successfully did.

Each breed of dog has physical or temeramental characteristics that are different from any other breed.

The question is NOT IF those characteristics affect a breed's nutritional requirements BUT HOW MUCH do they affect a breed's nutritional requirements?

WE SHOULD KNOW: Because the energy levels among the different breeds are different their nutritional requirements for food calories would also be different.

40

LIFE CYCLE CHANGES THAT CHANGE NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
As your dog goes through different stages of the life cycle, its nutritional needs change substantially. Here are a few guidelines to follow for: (1) puppies, (2) the maintenance years, (3) pregnant and lactating bitches, (4) older dogs and (5) nutritional changes due to stress. (1) Puppies After weaning, feed each puppy a high fat and carbohydrate diet in small dosages 3 or 4 times per day. Once the puppy has reached 40 to 50 percent of its adult weight, change feeding schedule to twice per day. Remember a pup's nutritional requirements can be 6 to 10 times more than adult maintenance requirements. This includes requirements for most vitamins and minerals when measured on a per-kilogram of body weight basis. This means an active 6 pound puppy can use the same dose as a 60 pound adult dog of the same breed. There are some breeds of dogs that are still puppies (nutritionally speaking) even after they have reached their full adult size. To treat them as adults, just because they have the body size of an adult, can rob them of nutrients that their body still requires to build good bones, teeth, muscles, coats, etc. So consider your breed of dog and nutritionally treat a puppy like a puppy until it has reached the adult maintenance stage of life regardless of its body size. (2) The maintenance years When the dog has developed to the adult stage of life it should be placed on a maintenance diet that will supply its dietary requirements under normal living conditions. This period could be called the "carefree years for feeding" for the average dog owner. The feeding times can be reduced to once daily and the amount should remain constant. Problems are few but normally arise from either a change of diet or the owner killing the dog through ignorance (but with love ) by giving it unhealthy treats such as table scraps, cookies, etc. We should remember that the maintenance years are just what the words say; they are a time to maintain a steady dietary program. 41

(3) Pregnant Bitches In the first two trimesters of pregnancy, a bitch's nutritional requirements change very little and she should be maintained on her normal maintenance diet. However, in the third trimester her needs change dramatically and I recommend the following adjustments in her daily dietary program: Begin to feed her more frequently, but decrease the amount of food given at each feeding. Increase the carbohydrate content of the food by about one-third while keeping the protein content at the same level. This can be done by putting her on a combination of her regular maintenance food and the same food that you will be feeding the puppies when they arrive. Most commercial puppy food is also higher in the vitamins and minerals that can be passed on to the puppies that are developing in her womb. If you use a supplement, increase her vitamin and mineral supplementation by 50%. Do not imbalance her system with additional calcium or any other single mineral. The balance of minerals is very important during this time both for the mother and the puppies. Continue with these changes until the puppies are weaned. After the puppies are weaned and her milk supply dries up, return the bitch to her standard maintenance dietary program. (4) Older Dogs Just as some breeds develop slower and need to be kept on a puppy formula longer, there are some breeds that reach the geriatric stage of life at later or earlier times than the average breed. When your dog reaches this stage, it becomes more difficult for it to convert protein to energy and they are normally not as active. Therefore, the protein amount in its daily food intake should be lower and the proportions of carbohydrates should be higher. Dogs reaching the geriatric stage also should be returned to the puppy feeding schedule. By changing their food to a high carbohydrate low protein blend, by increasing their feeding schedule to more than once daily, and by giving them smaller quantities of food at each feeding, you can prolong their life and make it more enjoyable. (5) Nutritional changes due to stress and other factors Often we create stress situations for our dogs without realizing it. At these times of stress the nutritional requirements can change dramatically in many ways. Two of these changes would be burning calories at a different rate and losing excessive amounts of body waters. Therefore, we must be aware of the types of situations that can cause stress in our dogs and be prepared to help them nutritionally through these times. An obvious stress situation would include the time of gestation and lactation for a bitch, with the birthing adding still more stress on her for that 42

special time. However, other times of stress can be caused by a visit to the vet, entering a dog show, schooling, hunting or even vacation travel. Not all times of relaxation for the dogs owner are times of relaxation for our pets. Dogs can experience stress any time their normal routine is changed. Also, like humans, different individuals will handle the stress differently. During these times of stress there are a few simple nutritional rules to follow. First be sure they have access to a good supply of water and do not over feed them with high protein foods. Remember that it is more work for their system to convert protein into energy than it is to convert carbohydrates. Therefore you should increase the carbohydrate % in the daily food intake. This can be done by giving them treats such as baked potatoes, pancakes, or rice cakes, during the hunt or on the way to the show, etc. Remember different breeds can assimilate carbohydrates from different sources at different rates. Therefore, you need to give the source of carbohydrate that is best for the dog you are feeding. Here I also caution you about supplementation. If you are going to replace the B vitamins (known as "the stress vitamins") during this time, be sure you follow the six steps listed in the chapter on supplementation. Also remember that the association between the B vitamins and the other nutrients is critical. Therefore, you should deal with the stress vitamins as a part of a nutritional team and not create nutritional stress by supplementing the B vitamins alone.

43

Each breed of dog has physical or temeramental characteristics that are different from any other breed.

The question is NOT IF those characteristics affect a breed's nutritional requirements BUT HOW MUCH do they affect a breed's nutritional requirements?

WE SHOULD KNOW: Some ailments are genetically passed on and are not common to all the different breeds. & Because the ailments have a direct effect on the dogs nutritional requirements these ailments make that breed's nutritional requirements different from all other breeds.

44

A HOME HEALTH CHECK FOR SYMPTOMS OF NUTRITIONAL PROBLEMS
You can tell whether your dog is getting good nutrition, IF you know what to look for. When you see the exterior results of good nutrition, you can be confident that the internal organs and systems are also healthy. Good nutrition helps your dog resist infections and disease so that it can live a longer, more productive life.

A PRODUCT FORMULATED FOR THE NUTRITIONALLY AVERAGE DOG
We can calculate the statistical average weight of all dogs in the country (46.7 pounds) or the statistical average height of all the dogs in the country (16.5 inches). Would the averaged sized dog also be the nutritionally average dog? Which single breed of dog represents the average size of all breeds? Dogs' body weights range from 1 pound to 235 pounds, with a height range of 5 inches to 35 inches. Their coats range from long to short, smooth to coarse, single to double - in every imaginable color. Their dispositions range from the hyper active and nervous to the laid back and listless. Not all breeds suffer from all the same ailments. The list of ailments the different breeds can suffer from includes: Hot Spots, Bloat, Dysplasia, respiratory problems, Hyper Thyroid, Hypo Thyroid, Progressive Retinal Atrophy, Heart Failure, Worms, Cataracts, Snow Nose, Eczema, Dwarfism, Hemophilia, Kidney Failure, Liver Failure, Torsion, Enclampsia, Cyst, Black Tongue, Slipped Stifle, Temperature Sensitive, Monorchidism, Dermoid Sinus, tumors, Collie Eye, Von Willebrand's Disease, etc. Since there are so many differences among the many breeds, which one breed accurately represents the average of all the other breeds? Could we claim that the nutritionally average breed is: (1) A Labrador Retriever, which is only one of the few breeds known to produce skin oils and not skin dander like most other breeds? (2) A Collie that needs ten times the amount of vitamin D than other breeds? (3) A Beagle that has a different requirement for vitamin A than other breeds? When commercial manufacturers of all-breed dog foods test their products, which breed should they use? Obviously, whatever breed they use, that breed is not going to be the nutritionally average breed of dog. It will not be a good representative for all the other breeds. The nutritionally average breed of dog does not exist! Testing a dog food formula on one breed, cannot develop a product that will meet the nutritional needs for all the different breeds. Developing all-breed dog foods by selective testing with only one breed would be the same as developing an all-breed dog grooming product after doing research on only a hairless breed. Even after testing the product on ten breeds that shed their coats, we should not expect the product to be correct for breeds that do not shed. 47

The different breeds of dogs

all

have genetic differences. One

genetic difference is: they all have different nutritional requirements. The nutritional requirements of the many breeds are so varied that no one single all-breed dog food can satisfy all their needs, or can even be considered safe for all the different breeds. I calculate the odds of an all-breed dog food being NUTRITIONALLY CORRECT for any single breed of dog at less than one-one thousandths of one percent. In the United States there are many all breed dog food companies collectively producing hundreds of different dog food formulas at any one time. Each of these companies is telling us that the formula they have is good for our breed of dog. Then they keep changing their formulas, looking for the ideal all-breed food. They can stop looking for this ideal all-breed food blend since it will never be found. They might as well take the next one hundred thousand years and devote their research laboratories to developing a nutritionally average dog. All-breed dog foods cannot provide what all the different dogs need. However, they do provide dog owners with what they want. As dog owners we want to be able to go to the store and get a prepackaged food that is easy to put into the dog's dish and won't take up much room in the garage. We want a product that will produce a small firm stool and is easy to clean up. We want it to be CONVENIENT. Because this is what we want, this is what commercial all breed dog food companies give us. Commercial dog food companies can give us both what we want and also what our dogs need TODAY! To do this, all they have to do is focus on a specific segment of the market instead of trying to cover it all with a single product. Ideally it would be best if they provided us with breed specific dog foods. It is my hope, that in the future, some large dog food company will come through and do the job right by providing foods formulated to the needs of the dogs eating them. For the commercial dog food companies to provide both what we want and what our dogs need, we must be willing to pay the price. Both manufacturing and marketing costs would increase. We also would need to be willing to give up some of the convenience present marketing methods provide. We know that dog food should be breed specific. Until we are willing to pay the higher price for what we know to be correct, our dogs will continue to pay the price of their life for our convenience. 48

THE HOME COOKING ALTERNATIVE
In Grandma’s day, just eighty-five years ago, there were fl() commercial dog foods for her to buy. Having no choice she had to cook for her pets. Today we can buy a can or bag of dog food or do it the way Grandma had to. Home cooking will always be harder than throwing a bag of pet food into a cart, yet a growing number of people today take time to cook for pets; justifying it by claiming it’s out of love, a desire to provide a healthier diet, or to save money. They have found that cocking for a single pet or a full kennel can take less than two hours per week. The equipment needed is found in the average kitchen and a beginning level cook has the skill. Home-cooked dog food can be prepared free of harmful additives. The preservatives BHA and BHT can cause epilepsy in dogs (Washington State University studies). Ethoxyquin produces kidney and liver disorders (Hazelton Laboratories study). The government’s National Research Council shows that even the antioxidant vitamin C, used as a preservative in many commercial dog foods, can cause kidney and liver problems in dogs. As I have said elsewhere, vitamin C may be a good preservative to use in human food but harmful for most dogs. The Morris Animal Foundation claims that kidney and liver disorders now rank as the second and sixth highest causes of household pet death in the U.S. Additives are found in dog foods to keep them looking good or to preserve them so they won’t turn rancid while sitting in a warehouse or at the retailers. Few pet owners would argue with the fact that a pet’s diet would be healthier if it was made without any additives. Cooking a dog’s food can even be cost efficient. For an eye opening cost comparison let’s use figures supplied by the dog food industry. In 1995 they claimed the average dog in this country weighed 46 pounds and would consume $248.00 of commercial dog food that year. Choosing a common commercial product (one sold in most grocery stores), reading that foods ingredient listing, and following the food’s feeding instructions, we see that average 46 pound dog could be fed 3112 cups per day of a food containing the following ingredients: chicken, wheat, corn gluten meal, poultry by-products (which may be hydrolyzed feathers, or feet and heads), beef tallow, rice, dried whey, vitamins, minerals, BHA and Ethoxyquin. 49

To cook for the same “average dog,” its owner would place the following into a large pan: • two pounds chopped chicken meat - 79¢ /lb, • one package frozen corn (ground into a tine pulp) - 59¢, • one pound beef tallow (or 1/2 cup of cooking oil) - 74¢/lb. Mix, bake for one hour at 35&, cool, and break into small pieces. To the juices add: • fourteen finely chopped slices whole wheat bread - 25¢, • 4 cups cooked rice - 35¢, • 1/8th pound of shredded cheese - 65¢. Mix all ingredients together, divide into seven reusable containers add: • seven pet formula multi-vitamin/mineral tablets (one in container) - 48¢ Refrigerate. These seven ready-to-serve home cooked meals for the ‘average~ pound dog are made with the same ingredients as those ii commercial food, except for the hydrolyzed feathers and preservatives The homecooked food will cost $4.64 for a one week supply. T~ less than the cost of a commercial food (divide their $248.00 by 52 weeks). Preparing home-cooked meals, because we care about our pet's health, can also save us money. Home-cooking allows us to prepare foods to meet a specific nutritional needs. We know that commercial foods sold for all can not possibly meet the needs of each individual member of the canine family. Two dogs of the same breed can even have different nutritional requirements. A dog’s temperament will affect its nutritional requirements. Two dogs of the same breed may look alike, yet one be active and one a permanent rug decoration. The two will have different nutritional requirements. Preparing separate recipes for these two based on their individual nutritional needs would be better for the health of each one. Dog owners today have a choice that was not even available just 85 years ago. Today you can choose to provide preservative-free customized to each dog's individual needs, or the preservative blends of an “any-dog” formula. You can serve healthy home-cooking or feed a repetitive diet of commercial fast-foods meals.

50

PLEASE REMEMBER: Do not use my one recipe for all dogs. Just as a commercial food should not be sold for all breeds, the recipe I show in this chapter should not be fed to all breeds. You should take into consideration where the breed you are feeding originated and limit the recipe ingredients to those found in that breed’s native environment. i.e., Since there are NO rice paddies in the Nordic Tundra, dogs from that environment should not be fed rice. I have listed the nutrient sources I recommend for each breed in the Breed by Breed section of this book. If you try to develop a recipe for your dog, based on the recipe in this chapter, you should substitute the correct food sources and adjust the portions according to the weight of the breed you are dealing with. You should also adjust your recipe according to any protein / carbohydrate I fiber directions given in the Breed by Breed section.

Each breed of dog has physical or temeramental characteristics that are different from any other breed.

BREED BY BREED

INTRODUCTION
In the following Breed By Breed chapters I recommend what I feel are the best foods for each breed of dog. Today we must choose from the dog foods that are presently available. Therefore, I have made my breed by breed recommendations based on the commercial food available at this time. I hope these recommendations will assist you in making an intelligent breed specific selection from the all-breed foods available. For these recommendations I have taken the following factors into consideration: (1) the nutritional history of each breed, (2) the nutrients of each breed's native environment, (3) * the nutrients presently found in commercial dog foods, and (4) the nutrients that would be foreign to a dog's system and cause it nutritional distress. *I recommend ingredients that can be found in different commercial dog foods rather than recommend a brand of food for your dog. I used to make recommendations for specific brands of dog food for specific breeds. However, I have stopped doing this because most dog food companies keep changing their formulas in search of that "ideal" allbreed dog food. For example, recommending a specific brand of dog food can cause problems. I recommended a specific brand of food to the owner of a kennel of Bichon Frise. She fed her dogs the food I recommended and was happy with the results. A short time later the dog food company changed the sources of the minerals in their product. This change was noted in fine print under "ingredients", but essentially the label on the products bag continued to look the same. Since they only changed the source and not the amount of the minerals, the change went unnoticed by the buyer. Her dogs then developed kidney stones on the food that was named the same and looked the same . . . . but was not the same as the food I had recommended. I also hope that my requiring you to read the labels on dog food products will result in your developing the habit of reading the entire label each time you buy dog food. This practice will improve your chances of detecting a formula change in your dog's food. 55

AFFENPINSCHER

Weight Standards: m/f - 7 to 8 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - under 10.25 inches Coat: wiry, shaggy, in black, tan, wheaton or red Common Ailments: slipped stifle and fractures

The Affenpinscher developed in the lowland farm area of Germany prior to the 15th century. It has a facial appearance similar to a monkey, and the literal translation of the German word Affenpinscher is "monkey terrier." This breed of dog is very quick afoot and at one time earned its keep as an effective stable yard ratter. Native food supplies for this breed would have been rodents (rats, mice and other small ground animals), poultry, and farmland grains of wheat, corn and barley or alfalfa with ground vegetables of potatoes, carrots and cabbage. For the Affenpinscher I recommend foods that are high in their carbohydrate content from potatoes and barley. The meat protein source should be a blend of horse meat and poultry. I also recommend that you avoid feeding any foods containing soy, beet pulp, white rice, fish meal or lamb to an Affenpinscher.

AFGHAN HOUND

Weight Standards: m - 60 lbs., f - 50 lbs. Height Standards: m - 27 inches, f - 25 inches Coat: double, long top coat, soft textured, in any color Common Ailments: cataracts, dysplasia, rashes, urinary problems

The Afghan, a sight hound, developed as a hunting dog in the Balkh, Barakzai, and Kurram valley areas of ancient Egypt, known now as Afghanistan. The earliest records of the Afghan date back some 8000 years ago to this area of ancient Egypt. These records show that they were used to hunt such animals as mountain deer, plains antelopes, hares, wolves, and snow leopards. Native food supplies for this breed would have included the mountain deer, plains antelopes, hare, wolves, snow leopards, fox, and fowl. The Balkh, Barakzai, and Kurram valley areas also provided grain crops such as wheat, corn, barley, and brown rice. There was a form of beef cattle in this area. However, the prevalent religions forbid the use of beef as a food source for humans and dogs alike. Therefore, I feel it is unlikely that the Afghan was exposed to this form of meat. For the Afghan hound I recommend foods with a high fiber, high carbohydrate percentage. The protein should be from sources of poultry and lamb, the carbohydrates from brown rice and wheat. For this breed I recommend you avoid foods based on soy, beet pulp, horse meat, or beef and their by-products. 58

AIREDALE TERRIER

Weight Standards: m - 50 to 60 lbs., f - 45 to 55 lbs. Height Standards: m - 23 inches, f - 22 inches Coat: short and wiry in black or saddle with tan extremities Common Ailments: can be hyperactive and develop skin rashes

The Airedale Terrier developed in Yorkshire County England. The human inhabitants of this area used this breed to control the otter population in order to improve the fishing. This developed a breed that, still today, is very much a water dog. An amusing Airedale trait is that they will dive under the water in pursuit of prey, a type of action that is very rare for any other breed. A special note; The Airedale Terrier seems to develop more skin and coat problems when taken to live in arid desert climates. These problems can be corrected by feeding that Airedale a diet with higher amounts of the fatty acids. Native food supplies found in Yorkshire County would have been meats from deer, boar, otter, and fresh water stream fish. Also vegetables of the low ground type were prevalent, such as carrots, potatoes, and cabbage. For the Airedale I recommend foods with starch from potato and meat from beef. The food should be high in fiber content from sources such as wheat and oats. However, I also recommend you avoid feeding white rice, beet pulp, or soy to the Airedale terrier. 59

AKITA

Weight Standards: m - 85 to 100 lbs., f - 75 to 85 lbs. Height Standards: m - 26 to 28 inches, f - 24 to 26 inches Coat: short and straight, harsh textured in any color Common Ailments: dysplasia

The Akita developed as a hunting dog in the Japanese prefectures of Gifu, Nagano, and Toyama. At one time its ownership was restricted to the nobility, who used the breed to hunt large game such as wild boar and deer. It was also used in the blood sport of dog fighting. Today, they are used as police and guard dogs, guide dogs for the blind, and as pets. The main meat sources in the Akita's native environment were bear, deer, wild boar, and fish. Rice was the main carbohydrate source of the area and vegetables were greens such as beans, cabbage, and tuber roots much like our sweet potato. For the Akita, I think the best blend of protein available from commercial dog foods would contain poultry, fish, rice and wheat. For this breed I also recommend adding about 1 to 2 teaspoons of canned white Tuna daily to the commercial foods. Akita owners can also make sure their dogs receive a fat-carbohydrate-protein balance similar to the breed's native diet by using a commercial puppy formula for the breed's entire life span. Akita owners should avoid feeding any dog food containing yellow corn, beet pulp, beef or horse meats. 60

ALASKAN MALAMUTE

Weight Standards: m - 85 lbs., f - 75 lbs. Height Standards: m - 25 inches, f - 23 inches Coat: dense in texture, straight with a long top coat Common Ailments: dwarfism, dysplasia, pigmentation

The Alaskan Malamute developed in the northern reaches of the area we now know as the state of Alaska. Named for an Inuit tribe from this area, the Alaskan Malamute tracked large game and served as a pack and sled dog. In camp it doubled as a family pet and guard dog, even serving as a nanny to the Inuit children. This breed originated in an area where the primary food sources were whale, salmon, halibut, and seal. None of today's commercial all-breed dog foods contain those sources prevalent in the original diet of the Alaskan Malamute. However, there are commercial foods that closely match the amino acid profile of the Alaskan Malamute's natural diet. These foods would have a combination of poultry, fish, lamb and rice in its protein base. These food sources are also high in minerals and natural occurring oils and thus would be the ideal base diet for this breed. The worst food blend for the Alaskan Malamute would contain a base of soy, beef or beef byproducts, beet pulp and yellow corn. 61

AMERICAN COCKER SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m - 27 lbs., f - 25 lbs. Height Standards: m - 15 inches, f - 14 inches Coat: soft, long and wavy topcoat. thick undercoat, in solid colors or parti-colored Common Ailments: PRA, hemophilia, slipped stifle, digestive disorders, cataracts, and ear problems The American Cocker Spaniel originated in America from selective English Cocker Spaniel breeding stock. In America the American Cocker Spaniel is often called by the nicknames "Cocker Spaniel" or "Cocker" while the English Cocker Spaniel is referred to by its full registered name. In England the reverse is true. This Cocker Spaniel retains many of the same nutritional requirements as the English Cocker Spaniel. However, the American Cocker Spaniel does not need a high carbohydrate diet like the English Cocker Spaniel, which remains exposed to a diet containing large quantities of carbohydrates from sources such as the potato. Yet the American Cocker must have a higher amount of the amino acid Lysine in its food than the English Cocker Spaniel. For the American Cocker Spaniel I recommend a food blend of corn, wheat, poultry, and dairy products. Also a blend of food sources containing low carbohydrates and an average fat content. Conversely, I feel the worst blend for this breed of Cocker Spaniel would contain fish, white rice, horse meat, or soy. 62

AMERICAN ESKIMO

Height Standards: two classes: Miniature; m - 12 to 15 inches, f - 11 to 14 inches, Standard; 15 to 19 inches, f - 14 to 18 inches Coat: solid white, double, with very thick under coat and top coat Common Ailments: hot spots, coat pigmentation problems

The American Eskimo did not develop in America at all. It can trace its history back over 6000 years to its origins as a member of the Nordic Spitz family of dog. A heavy year around shedder this breed requires a finely balanced diet to grow and maintain the thick and outstanding coat that is this breed's trademark. Also the amount of coat that this breed has is equal to many breeds of dog with a total weight of two to three times the American Eskimo's total weight. Therefore, when considering the nutritional requirements of this breed, one can readily see that nutrients related to the production of coat hair are going to be in high demand. Native food supplies for this breed would have been those found in the Nordic Tundra. These would have included fish, seal, caribou, reindeer, and vegetables that could grow in this environment's short growing season. For the American Eskimo I recommend foods that contain a blend of fish, poultry, horse meat, wheat, and potato. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a food containing white or brown rice, avocado, citrus, soy, or lamb to this breed of dog. 63

AMERICAN FOXHOUND

Weight Standards: m - 65 to 75 lbs., f - 60 - 70 lbs. Height Standards: m - 22 to 25 inches, f - 21 to 24 inches Coat: short, single, hard, black with brown and tan or tan and white Common Ailments: a very hardy breed

The American Foxhound developed in the Southeastern area of the U. S. A. It has not always been used as a scent hound to hunt the fox. There are diary accounts claiming this breed was used to hunt Indians rather than fox or hare. These accounts were written by DeSoto's retainers when this Spanish explorer was in the Carolinas during the early 1500's. This is a breed with a well documented history. For example, we can trace a single family of this hound back three hundred years to the specific date of 1650.

Native meat supplies for this breed would have been the small game animals found in the Carolina countryside, such as the fox, raccoon, and squirrel. The crops of this area consisted of corn, wheat, beets, beans (soy), and rice.

For the American Foxhound I recommend foods that contain a blend of beef, soy, wheat, rice and corn. However, the foods you should avoid feeding an American Foxhound are those containing fish meal, poultry or lamb. 64

AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIER (UKC) AMERICAN STAFFORDSHIRE TERRIER (AKC)

Weight Standards: m - 55 to 70 lbs., f - 40 to 55 lbs. Height Standards: m - 18 to 19 inches, f - 17 to 18 inches Coat: short, smooth, single in a variety of colors Common Ailments: dysplasia, heart & respiratory problems, bloat

The American Pit Bull Terrier / American Staffordshire Terrier developed in the area now known as Florida, U.S.A. Selected stock of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier were imported from England for their development. This breed has been known by a series of names: AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIER (UKC-1898), Yankee Terrier, Pit Bull Terrier, Half and Half, and American Bull Terrier. The American Kennel Club first accepted this breed in 1935 as the AMERICAN STAFFORDSHIRE TERRIER. This breed has been used for dog fighting and, if trained for that purpose, is very good at it. However, if it is not trained to be a warrior, it can make a good house pet, is very good with children, and is a warm and loving companion. Native food supplies for this breed would have been the crops and meats of colonial Florida. These included yellow corn, soy meal, rice, venison, and fish. For this breed I recommend foods that contain soy, corn, brown rice, beef, and poultry. However, since this breed needs a high fiber - low carbohydrate diet, you should avoid feeding a food with a high fat or starch content. 65

AMERICAN WATER SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m - 28 to 45 lbs., f - 25 to 45 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 15 to 18 inches Coat: short, curly, chocolate Common Ailments: hot spots (hair loss and dry coat)

It is believed the American Water Spaniel developed in the Northeastern part of the U.S.A. However, this cannot be confirmed and many of the first written reports about this breed came from sportsmen in the Midwestern states. It is a very good water retriever and uses a unique swimming motion like a seal. It is one of the few breeds that does not produce skin dander. This makes it ideal for people who have allergies to dogs' skin dander. This breed is one of the few breeds known to produce a skin oil. This gives the breed a requirement for higher amounts of the fatty acids than most other breeds. Native food supplies for this breed would have been those found from the Midwestern to Northeastern U.S. These included yellow corn, wheat, water fowl, and fresh water fish. For the American Water Spaniel, I recommend foods containing a blend of poultry, lamb, fish meal, wheat, and corn. I also recommend you avoid feeding this breed a food that contains white rice, soy, beet pulp, or horse meat. 66

ANATOLIAN SHEPHERD

Weight Standards: m - average 100 lbs., f - average 80 lbs. Height Standards: m - over 29 inches, f - under 27 inches Coat: short and smooth, in buff, white, black or even tricolor Common Ailments: hot spots and body rashes

The Anatolian Shepherd developed in the mountains of Turkey. It is a fiercely loyal guard dog and is still used to protect the flocks in its native land. Its size can be intimidating and yet it is known to be warm and loving to children. It is known to blow its coat annually and its nutritional requirements can change during this time. For example, their requirement for protein and fat increases while the lost coat is being replaced. Food supplies found in this breed's native area of Turkey would have included lamb, poultry, and brown rice. Any oils would have been from sources like olives or avocados. For the Anatolian Shepherd I recommend foods made with lamb, brown rice, and poultry. The food should be high in the fatty acids from vegetable sources such as the avocado. I also feel you should avoid feeding this breed a food that contains beef, horse meat, white rice, potato, soy or beet pulp. 67

AUSTRALIAN CATTLE DOG

Weight Standards: m/f - 40 to 45 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 18 to 19 inches Coat: dense in texture, black with tan and white speckle Common Ailments: dysplasia, hot spots and skin rashes The Australian Cattle Dog developed in Australia in the early 1800's. This breed can trace its heritage back to being a direct descendant of four specific breeds: the Dingo, the Blue Merle Highland Collie, the Dalmatian and the Black and Tan Kelpie. It originally herded cattle in the rough outback of Australia. Here it developed not only its nutritional requirements but its legendary stamina and endurance. Native food supplies for this breed would have been those found in the Australian outback (a high desert environment) and would have included ground vegetables, wheat, oats and meats from beef, rabbit, and kangaroo. A special note concerning the meats; all the meats from this area have a very low fat to muscle ratio. For the Australian Cattle dog I recommend low fat / high fiber foods with a blend of beef, corn, and wheat. I also recommend that you avoid feeding an Australian Cattle dog any soy, white rice, beet pulp, poultry or fish. 68

AUSTRALIAN TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - 12 lbs. to 14 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 10 inches Coat: harsh textured & straight, colors of blue & tan or sandy red Common Ailments: very hardy with few ailments reported

The Australian Terrier developed in the mountain foothills of Australia as both a ratter and a watchdog at the mines. The Australian Terrier performs both of these functions well. It is a relatively new breed of dog that was created by crossbreeding several different terrier breeds. One distinguishing feature of the Australian Terrier is its topknot, which may indicate it has relatives in common with the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. This is a very easy breed to keep in a small apartment or a confined area. Native food supplies for this breed would have been rodents, poultry, and mutton with grains of wheat or barley found in Australian foothills. For the Australian Terrier I recommend foods that contain horse meat, poultry, lamb, and wheat. However, I feel you should avoid feeding this Terrier any high carbohydrate foods or food containing soy or ocean fish protein. 69

BASENJI

Weight Standards: m - 25 lbs., f - 23 lbs. Height Standards: m - 17 inches, f - 16 inches Coat: short, silky smooth, single in tan, black or red with white Common Ailments: congenital hemolytic anemia, hyperactive

The Basenji developed in Central Africa as a sight hunter. It is not a mute dog, yet it is known as the "barkless dog." The sound that the Basenji makes is somewhere between a chortle and a yodel. In their native Africa they hunt small game by pointing, holding, and then upon command, driving the game into a net after the hunter is in position. They are also used as retrievers for the game that takes flight. Native food supplies for this breed would have been the African desert partridge and rabbit combined with a local form of the grains wheat and rice. Another staple of their diet would have been a tuber root that is very similar to the peanut. For the Basenji I recommend foods that contain their protein from beef and horse meats blended with poultry. The carbohydrate sources should be from brown rice and wheat. However, you should avoid feeding a Basenji any foods containing soy, beet pulp, fish, lamb or white rice. 70

BASSET HOUND

Weight Standards: m/f - average 50 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - under 15 inches Coat: short and smooth in brown or red with white Common Ailments: respiratory problems (snore) and an overeater

The Basset Hound developed in France. Basset is the French word meaning "low set" and for a breed that weighs about 50 pounds they are very low set. They may appear to be overweight due to a loose coat that will hang in folds on their body. However, I must point out that this breed does not normally have a body weight problem. The first Basset hounds in this country appeared after the American Revolution when Lafayette presented them as a gift of state to George Washington. The Basset has a very keen sense of smell. Their long low set ears also help cup the scent during a hunt. Their short legs can cover an amazing amount of ground in a short time and, therefore, they can hunt game such as the fleet rabbit or deer. Native meat supplies for this breed would have been venison, rabbit, mutton, and poultry. The farm crops were wheat, corn, and beets. For the Basset Hound I recommend foods with poultry, lamb, wheat and corn. However, you should avoid feeding a Basset Hound any soy meal, horse meat, beef or its by-products, fish or white rice. 71

BEAGLE

Weight Standards: two classes m/f - 13" and under 15 to 20 lbs., 13" to 15" - 20 to 30 lbs. Height Standards: two classes m/f - 13" and under and over 13" but not exceeding 15" Coat: short, smooth textured, in black with white and tan Common Ailments: A very hardy breed with few ailments

The Beagle is a very active scent hound that originated in England. It is one of the oldest pure-bred breeds known, with a written history that dates from a time before the Norman Invasion of England in 1066. The Celtic tribesmen who hunted with this breed also named it. The Beagle's name comes from the Celtic word beag meaning "small." I note that when hunting, the Beagle requires high carbohydrate snacks. The Beagle burns calories at an exceptional rate during times of stress or work. Like other breeds, they are unable to store the carbohydrate to burn for this energy and a heavy demand on their protein energy stores can cause muscle cramping. The Beagle also will require larger intakes of water during times of stress or work. The Beagle originated in an area of England where its primary food sources would have been beets, potatoes, mutton, wheat, corn, rabbit, and poultry. Thus a blend of these foods, which are high in carbohydrates and have a high fat to protein ratio, would be the ideal base diet for the Beagle. Conversely, the worst blend would contain fish, rice, beef or beef by-products, horse meat, or soy. 72

BEARDED COLLIE

Weight Standards: m/f - average 50 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 22 inches Coat: medium length double coated with a very soft top coat Common Ailments: dysplasia, skin rashes, hot spots and other skin and coat problems

The Bearded Collie developed in the southern mainland of Scotland in the 1700's. For centuries it has worked as the Scottish Highlanders' able assistant, both as a drover and as a sheepdog. A special note: Breeders have confirmed that this breed's requirement for minerals, which it can assimilate, is very different from the rough or smooth coated Collies. i.e.. The wrong source of the mineral calcium can cause kidney stones. Therefore, I recommend that any dietary calcium for this breed be from bone meal, and that you avoid dolomite or oyster shell forms. Native food supplies for this breed would have been those found in the southern mainland of Scotland. These included mutton, goat, poultry, and low ground vegetable crops of potatoes, cabbage, and carrots. For the Bearded Collie, I recommend foods low in fat that have a blend of poultry, lamb, wheat, and potato. However, you should avoid feeding a blend of soy, fish yellow corn, and horse meat or its by-products to a Bearded Collie. 73

BEDLINGTON TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - 17 to 23 lbs. Height Standards: m - 16.5 inches, f - 15.5 inches Coat: coarse, short and curly, needs to be stripped Common Ailments: PRA and other eye problems, liver and kidney disorders, hyper thyroid

The Bedlington Terrier developed in the area of Rothbury, England. It hunted otter, coursed rabbit, and worked as a pit fighter. In the NRC Nutrient Requirements of Dogs , the Bedlington Terrier was one breed used in the testing of copper requirements. Copper is needed to form red blood cells in all dogs. These tests showed that this breed has copper requirements that are totally unique and very low. Yet, I stress the importance of providing copper to the Bedlington. I also stress that the Bedlington's copper be balanced to other nutritional team members as outlined in the chapter "Nutritional Teams." For this breed, the copper should not be from a sulfate source. Native food supplies for this breed would have been otter, fresh water fish, rodents, oats, and wheat, - such as those found in the area of Rothbury, England. For the Bedlington I recommend foods that are a blend of horse meat and fish with wheat and oats. I also recommend that you avoid feeding a food with soy, lamb, white rice or yellow corn to this breed. 74

BELGIAN MALINOIS

Weight Standards: m - 65 to 75 lbs., f - 55 to 65 lbs. Height Standards: m - 24 to 26 inches, f - 22 to 24 inches Coat: short and straight in light tricolors Common Ailments: the hardiest of the Belgian herding breeds

The Belgian Malinois developed near the city of Malines, Belgium, which is a northern city close to the border of the Netherlands and North Sea. Often this breed is called the short coated Belgian Tervuren. Yet these two breeds are very different. The Belgian Malinois has a requirement for less fiber in its diet than the other Belgium herding breeds. Its requirement for minerals is also unique. The Malinois can best use mineral sources associated with a coastal environment rather than those found in the environment of Laeken, which would be the native environment of the Tervuren. Native food supplies for the Belgium Malinois breed would have been associated with the sea foods of the North Sea. The Maline's area also provided goat, poultry, cabbage, and wheat. For the Belgian Malinois I recommend foods that are low in fiber and have protein from poultry, ocean fish, and wheat. You should avoid feeding the Mal any soy, beet pulp (good for the Tervuren), horse meat or beef. 75

BELGIAN SHEEPDOG

Weight Standards: m - 65 to 75 lbs., f - 55 to 65 lbs. Height Standards: m - 24 to 26 inches, f - 22 to 24 inches Coat: solid black, straight and long with an undercoat that gives it a dense appearance Common Ailments: liver and kidney disorders The Belgian Sheepdog developed in the city of Groenendael, Belgium. This city is on the border of Luxembourg and is nestled in the foothills of that country's Alpine Mountains. In most of the world this breed is called the "Groenendael" and it is only in America that it is called the "Belgian Sheepdog." They are very intelligent and have been used throughout Europe for police work. They make great pets since they are very faithful companions and loyal watchdogs. When properly fed, this breed's solid black coat is beautiful. However, when fed protein with a low amount of the amino acid Phenylalanine, its coat can lose its pigmentation and that beautiful black color can turn to a dull orange. Native food supplies for this breed would have included beets, (which are the main vegetable crop of the area), wheat, mutton, poultry, and a limited amount of beef. For the Belgian Sheepdog I recommend foods from low fat poultry and high carbohydrate beet, blended with wheat and beef. You should avoid feeding a commercial food with soy, fish, yellow corn or horse meat to this breed. 76

BELGIAN TERVUREN

Weight Standards: m - 65 to 75 lbs., f - 55 to 65 lbs. Height Standards: m - 24 to 26 inches, f 22 to 24 inches Coat: long, dense and straight in tricolor Common Ailments: hot spots and skin rashes The Belgian Tervuren developed in the Laeken area of Belgium. The Laeken area of Belgium is on the border of Germany. It would have provided a very different environment than the foothills of the Alps or the coastal region next to the North Sea where the other two AKC recognized Belgian herding breeds developed. This breed is a very special working dog that earned a place in history during World War I as a messenger carrier. One major casualty of the war could have been the extinction of this breed of dog. Many of them were lost while performing their duty in battle. However, thankfully, after the war European dog fanciers worked to save this breed from extinction.

Their native environment would have supplied foods including beef, oats, beets, cabbage, and other leafy greens. Note: the meats from this environment all contained a high amount of body fat to muscle ratio.

For the Belgian Tervuren I recommend foods from beef, wheat, beet pulp, and oats. These foods should be high in their animal fat content. Avoid any food that contains soy, fish, corn, white rice or horse meat for this breed. 77

BERNESE MOUNTAIN DOG

Weight Standards: m - 80 to 105 lbs., f - 75 to 90 lbs. Height Standards: m - 23 to 27.5 inches, f - 21 to 26 inches Coat: medium long, flat, soft, wavy topcoat, black with rust & white Common Ailments: bloat, dysplasia, hot spots

The Bernese Mountain Dog developed in the Bern Region of the Swiss Alps. They herded livestock and worked as cart dogs to transport goods and produce to market. Due to the high mineral content in the soil and water supplies of the Bern Region of Switzerland, this breed developed a need for a unique balance of minerals such as selenium, iron, zinc and manganese in its diet. The alpine mountain environment around Bern remained very cold year round and therefore produced a dog with more body fat than breeds that developed in warmer climates. Most animals that could survive the Bern Valley's alpine environment also had this extra body fat. Since these were the animals that formed the meat base of the Bernese Mountain Dog's noncommercial diet, today's Bernese Mountain Dog also will do best on food sources with high fat content. Native foods that would have been in this breed's diet would have included goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and low ground vegetables. I recommend food that contains a blend of poultry, lamb, and wheat as the best for this breed. Avoid foods that contain yellow corn, soy, ocean fish, beef or horse meat and their by-products. 78

BICHON FRISE

Weight Standards: m/f - 11 to 15 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 8 to 12 inches Coat: thick, short, double, white Common Ailments: skin and ear problems The Bichon Frise's home port was in the Mediterranean area of what is now France and Italy. They became popular world wide by accompanying the sailors from their home ports around the world and were used as a trade item. The name Bichon Frise when translated from French means curly-coated lapdog, a name that this breed definitely earned. The Bichon is one of the few breeds that can assimilate the minerals that are from sulfate sources. I credit this unique feature to the soil from their native environment being primarily limestone with mineral deposits having molecular forms similar to commercial sulfate sources. This is important since the Bichon, like most other breeds of dog, will develop kidney stones when the dietary minerals are from sources they cannot assimilate. The primary food sources of this breed's native environment included fish, goat, wheat, green vegetables, and carbohydrates of the type found in pasta. For this breed of dog I recommend a blend that contains poultry, lamb, fish, rice, avocado, and wheat. These should provide the closest amino acid balance to that required by the Bichon Frise. Conversely, I feel the least desirable blend would contain beef or its by-products, with soy and yellow corn meal. 79

BLACK AND TAN COONHOUND

Weight Standards: m - 80 to 90 lbs., f - 65 to 75 lbs. Height Standards: m - 26 to 28 inches, f - 23 to 26 inches Coat: short and smooth in black and tan Common Ailments: hypo thyroid, skin and coat problems

The Black and Tan Coonhound developed in the Southeastern U.S.A. (the Carolinas). It is a scent hound that only gives voice after he has successfully treed his quarry. The Black and Tan Coonhound is a very powerful dog that has the courage required to keep a mountain lion or bear at bay until the hunter arrives, as well as the quickness and stamina required to hunt raccoon, and deer. Native food supplies for this breed would have been the same as for the early Carolina colonists. This area provided meats from deer, bear, wild boar, and turkey. Rice was a larger commercial crop than tobacco or cotton in the Carolinas before the Civil War and therefore would have been a staple of this breed's diet. The other native vegetable crops of soy bean and flax are the reasons this breed developed its requirement for high amounts of dietary vegetable oil. For the Black and Tan Coonhound I recommend foods that contain lots of rice blended with beef or horse meat, corn, wheat, and beet pulp. However, you should avoid feeding a Black and Tan Coonhound any fish or lamb. 80

BLOODHOUND

Weight Standards: m - 90 to 110 lbs., f - 80 to 100 lbs. Height Standards: m - 25 to 27 inches, f - 23 to 25 inches Coat: short and smooth in black or liver with tan Common Ailments: bloat, thyroid problems

The Bloodhound developed prior to the twelfth century in the vicinity of Constantinople. This was a seaport in the country we now know as Turkey. They have been blessed with a scenting ability that is unparalleled by any other breed of dog. Bloodhounds have a genetic tendency to hypothyroidism, which is an inability of the thyroid gland to manufacture sufficient amounts of thyroxine. Within the thyroid gland iodine molecules and protein molecules join to make thyroxine. Therefore, this process can be helped by providing the proper form of iodine for their thyroid gland to use. I feel the best form of iodine for the Bloodhound is the natural form found in sea kelp, and the worst form is any one of the artificial isotopes of iodine. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from their seaport environment and included ocean fish, pork, goat, wheat, brown rice, high carbohydrate vegetables, and fruits such as avocado, olive or fig. For the Bloodhound I recommend food with a blend of wheat, brown rice, avocado, and poultry. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a Bloodhound any beef and its by-products, soy, beets, lamb, or white rice. 81

BORDER COLLIE

Weight Standards: m - 45 to 55 lbs.; f - 35 to 45 lbs. Coat: ranges from short to long; black with white markings, also tricolor, liver and white, and blue and red merle. Common Ailments: Hot spots, collie eye, von Willebrand's disease

The Border Collie originated in Scotland and is considered by some to be the grandparent of all collies. They are bred for their intelligence and their ability to perform rather than how they conform to a set of physical standards. They are a true working dog. While performing their duties, they can cover a distance of over 100 miles without rest in a single day. The primary food sources found in the Border Collie's native environment would have included potatoes, wheat, corn, lamb, fish, and poultry. The Border Collie requires its mineral complex to be from sources that are similar to those found in a coastal environment. Breeders have indicated that the minerals from other sources can produce many dietary problems for this breed. I recommend a blend of foods that are high in their carbohydrate-toprotein ratio as best for a Border Collie. The food sources should be from potatoes, wheat, corn, lamb, fish, and poultry. Food sources that should be avoided by the Border Collie are soy, beet pulp, avocado, or white rice. 82

BORDER TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - average 15 lbs. Height Standards: m - 13 to 15.5 inches, f - 11.5 to 14 inches Coat: short and harsh, needs to be stripped, in many colors; Wheaton, grizzle or tan being the most popular Common Ailments: a very hardy breed with few ailments

The Border Terrier developed in the Cheviot Hills on the northern border of England. Once called the Coquetdale Terrier it has been a favorite of the farmers in its native land for centuries. The gentry desired the Border Terrier's size so that they would have a dog that could "go to ground" after a fox, yet keep up with the horses during a chase. Its most unique physical characteristic is a very distinctive head with the physical appearance like that of an otter. Native food supplies for this breed would have been fox, hare, and rodents - with wheat and low ground vegetables (potato, carrot, and cabbage) that could be grown in the rocky soil of the Cheviot Hills area. For the Border Terrier I recommend foods with horse meat, wheat and yellow corn. The starch and carbohydrates should come from potatoes and not rice or beets. You also should avoid feeding a Border Terrier any soy, poultry, or white fish. 83

BORZOI

Weight Standards: m - 75 to 105 lbs., f - 60 to 90 lbs. Height Standards: m - over 28 inches, f - over 26 inches Coat: long, silky outer coat in white with black or tan Common Ailments: bloat, torsion, hot spots, a picky eater The Borzoi, once known as the Russian Wolfhound, developed in Russia as a hunting companion to the aristocracy. The history of this breed can be traced for centuries with a set of breed standards first established in the 1600's. The history books also show us that this breed almost became extinct in its native land. The Bolsheviks started slaughtering them due to their association with the aristocracy during the Russian Revolution of 1917. A sight hound, it hunted by running down and holding the prey until its human companion arrived. The prey it hunted ranged from the Russian wolf, which is a large ferocious beast in its own right, to deer and small game animals such as rabbit. To hunt this range of prey the Borzoi needed to be strong and courageous, yet also possess extreme speed and agility. All these traits are still retained by today's Borzoi. Native food supplies for this breed would have been those naturally found in the coniferous forest and steppe grasslands of its native Russia. These included the wolf, deer, and other small game animals. This area also provided the high fiber grains of wheat and alfalfa. For the Borzoi I recommend foods that blend beef and horse meat with wheat and yellow corn. However, you should avoid feeding a Borzoi white rice, soy, beet pulp, or fish (especially the white ocean varieties). 84

BOSTON TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - around 25 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 15 inches Coat: short and smooth in black and white or brindle and white Common Ailments: respiratory and circulatory problems, heat and cold sensitive, eye problems The Boston Terrier developed in the seaport city of Boston in the Northeastern United States. The American Kennel Club first registered this breed in 1893. They are descendants of a cross between a White English Terrier and the English Bulldog. Boston Terriers were originally known as Round Heads or Bull Terriers. It is a breed that keeps itself clean and is easy to maintain. It is also a breed that is very intelligent and good with children. Therefore, it is easy to see why once they were the most popular breed of dog registered in the United states. Native food supplies for this breed would have been cattle and dairy products, wheat, beets, corn, and fish. For the Boston Terrier I recommend foods that have beef and fish blended with beet pulp, wheat, and yellow corn. The Boston Terrier should avoid any soy products, white rice, or highly acidic foods. 85

BOUVIER DES FLANDRES

Weight Standards: m - 90 to 110 lbs., f - 80 to 95 lbs. Height Standards: m - 23.5 to 27.5 inches, f - 22.5 to 26.5 inches Coat: medium length, double, harsh in solid gray or black Common Ailments: bloat, dysplasia, hot spots and skin rashes The Bouvier des Flandres developed in the area of Brussels, Belgium. Major Police forces throughout the world use and respect this breed for their loyalty and devotion to duty. Being very intelligent, they are easy to train. However, they need an owner who will not turn over the leadership role to the dog. Their demanding personality can make life miserable for the humans in the house, if allowed to assume the role of the master. When they are allowed to assume the role of the master, they can be very hard to retrain. Their original function in life was to round up the cattle and drive them to market. Often they use these same herding skills with small children who are placed in their very capable care. Native food supplies from the environment near Brussels, Belgium, would have included beef cattle, fish, a form of brown rice, and flax. For the Bouvier des Flandres I recommend foods that are a blend of beef meal and fish with brown rice and wheat. This food also should have a very high vegetable oil content from wheat germ oil or linseed oil. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a Bouvier des Flandres yellow corn, soy (including soy oil coat conditioners), beet pulp, or horse meat.

86

BOXER

Weight Standards: m - average 70 lbs., f - around 60 lbs. Height Standards: m - 22.5 to 25 inches, f - 21 to 23.5 inches Coat: single, short, smooth, fawn or brindle with white Common Ailments: bloat, tumors, digestive disorders The Boxer originated in Germany as a medium-sized security dog. This breed was named for the manner in which it starts a fight; it makes motions with its front paws like a man when boxing. Without the proper nutrients (high in their fiber content) the Boxer has a tendency to bloat and produce intestinal gas. This is partly due to the size and length of the boxer's colon. Other causes of gastric bloating are associated with a gland in the boxer's digestive system. This gland, the pancreas, secretes digestive enzymes such as trypsin, amylase and lypase. Tests have revealed that the Boxer's pancreas produces these digestive enzymes at a markedly different rate than those produced by the pancreas of many other breeds in the same weight category. Because of this digestive enzyme difference, an all-breed dog food may cause the Boxer to experience gastric problems not commonly found in other breeds of dogs. The primary food sources in the Boxer's native environment were whole oat, rye, pork, and poultry. I recommend a blend of these food sources as an ideal diet because they are high in fats, fiber, and trace minerals. Conversely, the worst blend would consist of fish, soy, rice, beet pulp and horse meat or its by-products. 87

BRIARD

Weight Standards: m - 80 to 90 lbs., f - 70 to 80 lbs. Height Standards: m - 23 to 27 inches, f - 22 to 25.5 inches Coat: long and silky, slightly wavy and in any solid color but white Common Ailments: bloat, dysplasia The Briard developed in the area of Southern France as a herding dog for the nomadic Bask people. As the working dog of the Bask, they established themselves as excellent herding dogs, and when properly trained, they are a pleasure to watch. When they are running, their gait is so smooth that they have the appearance of floating above the ground. Marquis de Lafayette first brought them to this country in 1777 when he came from France to join Washington's staff. Some other people they have accompanied in their illustrious history have been Napoleon and Charlemagne. Native food supplies for this breed would have been the type of vegetation grown in the middle and high latitude forests and broadleaf and broadleaf-conifer forests that the nomadic Bask traveled through in Southern France and Eastern Spain. The grains of wheat, corn, and wild rice would have been the prevalent starch and fiber sources for their dietary intake. Meat sources would have consisted of mutton and pork from the Basks' herds as well as fish from the local streams. For the Briard I recommend foods that have a blend of lamb, fish, wheat, and brown rice. However, I suggest that you avoid feeding a Briard any soy products, beet pulp, white rice, beef, or beef by-products. 88

BRITTANY SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m/f - 30 to 40 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 17.5 to 20.5 inches Coat: short, single, wavy with feathers, liver and white Common Ailments: very hardy with few ailments The Brittany Spaniel developed in an area of today's France that was controlled by the kings of England during the Middle Ages. This area was a popular hunting territory for the Norman nobles whose ancestors crossed the English Channel and successfully conquered England in 1066. These Norman nobles were responsible for the development of a hunting dog, which is the same Brittany Spaniel we know today. The primary nutrients of their native environment would have been poultry, fish of the trout family, beets, and potatoes. I note that this was a swampy area and supported few grain crops. I feel it was this factor that led to a critical difference between the Brittany Spaniel's nutritional requirements and those of the English Springer Spaniel -- especially in the area of carbohydrate needs. Reportedly, the Brittany can utilize a higher starch and carbohydrate to protein ratio than its English cousin (The English Springer Spaniel) when the carbohydrate source is beet pulp or potatoes. The Brittany also does poorly on blends containing corn, barley or wheat, which are good for the English Springer Spaniel. For the Brittany Spaniel, use foods with sources of poultry, lamb, and beet pulp. Avoid foods based on beef or horse meat and their byproducts as well as any yellow corn, barley, wheat, or soy products. 89

BRUSSELS GRIFFON

Weight Standards: m/f - 8 to 12 lbs., Height Standards: m/f - average 8 inches Coat: short and thick in black tan or beige, needs stripping Common Ailments: slipped stifle, eye and respiratory problems The Brussels Griffon developed in the township of Brussels, Belgium, where it first earned its keep as a ratter in the stables. It then took a place beside the coachman for the hansom cabs (a horse drawn coach) from those stables. Its new duties included being the watch dog or guardian for the coach and its inhabitants. Native food supplies for this breed would have included the stable's rodent population as well as the grains eaten by those rodents. Here, I would like to note an important nutritional requirement for the Brussels Griffon. They have a requirement for the same dietary amount of the alpha-Linolenate family of fatty acids as many larger dogs from other environments. This per pound of body weight nutritional difference I attribute to their native environment's high production of the grain flax (a grain known to contain very high percentages of the alpha-Linolenate fatty acids). For this breed I recommend foods of horse meat and beef with grains of wheat and yellow corn. The dietary fatty acids should be from grain sources similar to flax, and I recommend the commercial forms of linseed or wheat germ oil since a Brussels Griffon can use these better than fatty acids found in animal fat or soy. Foods I suggest you avoid feeding a Brussels Griffon are soy, poultry, lamb, avocado, and white rice. 90

BULL TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - 35 to 55 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 18.5 inches Coat: short and smooth in solid white or tricolored with black & tan Common Ailments: inner ear infections, circulatory problems, and skin rashes with hives The Bull Terrier developed on the outskirts of London, England. They were first bred to be a pit fighter, but that soon ended. They were then taught to only defend themselves or their masters and not to seek out or provoke a fight. It was during this later stage in their history that they received their reputation of being bred by gentlemen for gentlemen. The advertising industry has exploited their clownish personality in commercials from shoes to beer. They are very fond of children and make good family pets. However, I have been told that this breed's training should start at an early age, since they tend to have a stubborn streak. Native food supplies for this breed consisted of beef and potatoes with carrots, cabbage, and wheat. These are still the staples of the average Londoner's diet. For the Bull Terrier I recommend foods that contain the protein from beef and wheat, the carbohydrates from potatoes, and the fiber from cabbage. However, I also recommend that you avoid feeding a Bull Terrier any white rice, avocado, soy, or ocean fish. 91

BULLDOG

Weight Standards: m - average 50 lbs., f - average 40 lbs. Height Standards: m - average 16 inches, f - average 14 inches Coat: short and smooth in all colors except black Common Ailments: heart and respiratory ailments, skin problems, hyper thyroid, drools and snuffles The Bulldog developed in the northern farmland counties of the British Empire where it was used in the "sport" of bull baiting. Fortunately this "sport" is gone and the Bulldog remains. It was one of the first breeds recognized by the newly organized Kennel Club of England in 1873. At this time the breed standards were established. These standards have not changed since. This breed is very strong (muscled and willed) and has taken more than one child for a walk to wherever the dog decided to go. Nutritionally the Bulldog is a breed of dog that is very slow to mature. They reach their full adult body size at about 14 months but should be nutritionally treated as a puppy until about the 30th month. This will help develop healthier bones, teeth, muscles, and coats. Native food supplies for this breed would have been beef and dairy products blended with large quantities of high carbohydrate potatoes and cabbage. For this reason, today's Bulldog needs a food with a very high percentage of carbohydrate and fiber but not a very high amount of protein. For the Bulldog I recommend foods high in potato type carbohydrates with the protein being from a beef, wheat, and yellow corn blend. You should avoid feeding a Bulldog any white rice, soy, poultry, or lamb. 92

BULLMASTIFF

Weight Standards: m - 110 to 130 lbs., f - 100 to 120 lbs. Height Standards: m -25 to 27 inches, f - 24 to 26 inches Coat: short and smooth in brindle or fawn Common Ailments: bloat, dysplasia, tumors, mouth boils The Bullmastiff developed in Northern England where it earned its keep as a game keeper's able assistant. They patrolled the country estates of the wealthy landowners and were trained to warn the game keeper of poachers. They ran down the poacher, threw him to the ground, and held him without harm until the game keeper came. For this kind of job, they needed to be very intelligent, very territorial and very powerful. Traits originally sought in an estates Bullmastiff puppy population have now become the norm for this breed. Another norm for this breed that developed in Northern England was the Bullmastiff's unique nutritional needs. Food supplies from the English estates played a role in the development of this breed's nutritional needs. These consisted of poultry, such as chukker or quail, meats like venison, boar or hare, and grain crops of wheat and oats. For the Bullmastiff I recommend foods that blend equal amounts of beef with horse meat and poultry. The food also should have a very high fiber content from whole oats, wheat, and whole corn. However, I also feel that you should avoid feeding any food that contains fish or soy or any minerals that are from sulfate sources to a Bullmastiff. 93

CAIRN TERRIER

Weight Standards: m - 13 to 15 lbs., f - 12 to 14 lbs. Height Standards: m - 10 inches, f - 9.5 inches Coat: harsh and short and in any color except white Common Ailments: thyroid problems The Cairn Terrier developed in the Western Coastal Region of Scotland. At one time it was so popular on the island of Skye that it was called the "Short Haired Skye." However, to avoid any confusion, since there was a breed with the registered name of "Skye Terrier", the dog fanciers who first registered this breed with the English Kennel Club presented it with the name of Cairn Terrier. This terrier hunted in packs to control the fur bearing vermin, such as otter and fox that inhabited the rocky shoreline of this breed's native environment. Their name "Cairn" comes from the Galic language and means "the heap of stones where a fox would burrow." Native food supplies for this breed would have been those that are associated with a harsh coastal North Sea environment. These included meats of the otter or fox, which inhabited the rocky cliffs, and vegetables that could grow well in the shallow rocky soil. For the Cairn I recommend foods of ocean fish blended with poultry and wheat. I also recommend that you avoid feeding a Cairn any soy products, rice (both white or brown), or avocado. 94

CARDIGAN WELSH CORGI

Weight Standards: m/f - average 33 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 12 inches Coat: short and harsh in tan and black with white Common Ailments: spinal disc and digestive disorders The Cardigan Welsh Corgi developed in the area of Cardiganshire, in the Welsh highlands over 3000 years ago. The first written report of the Cardigan comes from the Celtic tribes that inhabited the area we now know as Wales. They described a dog that was a good baby-sitter and hunter. This breed is often mistaken for the Pembroke Welsh Corgi. However, if there is a relationship between these two very different breeds, it is very distant. Opposite to the rounding up actions of the other breeds of dog that are in the AKC's herding group, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi chased the tribes' cattle. This scattered the cattle over a larger grazing area, thus insuring the herd a sufficient amount of food. This action insured survival of the cattle in a native environment that was very rocky and where grass was very scarce. The native food supplies for all inhabitants of the Cardiganshire area, including the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, would have been the type that could survive in the rocky soil. These would have included rye, cabbage, potatoes, and carrots. Also native to this environment would have been meats of the hare, both ocean and fresh water fish, and a very stringy beef with a low fat content. For the Cardigan Welsh Corgi I recommend foods that are a blend of fish and small amounts of beef combined with rye, oats, and yellow corn. You should avoid feeding a blend that contains white rice, soy, or beet pulp. 95

CHESAPEAKE BAY RETRIEVER

Weight Standards: m - 65 to 75 lbs., f - 55 to 65 lbs. Height Standards: m - 23 to 26 inches, f - 21 to 24 inches Coat: short and coarse with a thick undercoat, in brown or tan Common Ailments: skin problems, dysplasia, liver &kidney failure The Chesapeake Bay Retriever developed in 1807 in Maryland, U.S.A.. This is one breed that can trace its beginnings to two specific dogs named "Sailor" and "Canton." The Chesapeake is a breed that is extremely good in the home with children; yet it is known more as a hunter than a pet. This breed has a very dense undercoat that it keeps oiled naturally when fed the proper balance of the alpha-linolenic fatty acids. This characteristic makes it a good breed for people who are allergic to the skin dander produced by most other breeds. The fact that it naturally produces these oils (only one of six breeds that does) also gives it a whole set of different nutritional requirements than those breeds that do not produce skin oil. The native nutrients for this breeds forefathers are unknown. Yet they do well on fish and water foul, such as duck and goose (which are very high in their fat to meat ratio), and grains such as wild rice and wheat. For this breed I recommend a commercial food blend that is high in poultry fats. Its protein should be from poultry as well. The food should contain brown, not white rice, and any other carbohydrates should be supplied by wheat. For the Chesapeake Bay Retriever it is best to avoid foods that contain beef or horse meat, lamb, beet pulp, or soy. 96

CHIHUAHUA

Weight Standards: m - 5 to 6 lbs., f - 4 to 5 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 5 inches Coat: two varieties; long and soft; short and soft. Common Ailments: slipped stifle, rheumatism, gum ailments, liver failure, and temperature sensitive The Chihuahua that we know today was named after its area of origin, Chihuahua, Mexico. Archaeologists have given us the best account of this breed's history by finding its association with the ancient Aztecs. The Chihuahua was both a religious necessity and a working dog for the Aztec priest. It earned its keep in the temples by controlling the rodent population. Archaeologists also show that this breed lived a life span almost double to that expected by today's Chihuahua owner. I believe there is an association between this breed's unique nutritional requirements, the nutrient levels found in all-breed dog foods, and this breed's reduced life span. Rain forests and jungles of Mexico and South America provided the native food supplies for this breed. Tropical fruits such as mango and avocado were plentiful in this environment and would have been a staple of the dietary intake. Meats were rodents or wild boar and poultry. For today's Chihuahua I recommend foods that contain avocado blended with poultry and rice. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a food that contains beef, or beet pulp to this nutritionally delicate breed. 97

CHINESE CRESTED

Weight Standards: m/f - 6 to 8 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 5 inches Coat: hairless except for crest on head and fringes on feet and at tip of tail Common Ailments: body rashes, liver failure, temperature sensitive

The Chinese Crested, a "hairless breed", developed in China as a favorite pet of the Mandarins. However, it is now extinct in that area of the world. For the last five centuries the Crested that we know today has been a resident in the West Indies and coastal port cities of South America. The Crested survived, thanks to the sailors from the Clipper Ships out of Spain and Portugal. These ships traded with China, taking this breed to other ports of call as both a food and a trade item. It is the smallest of the "hairless breeds"; such a small dog to have such a very long and colorful history. Native food supplies for this breed would have been those from the coastal cities of China and later, South America. The primary nutrients would have consisted of ocean fish, white rice and soy products. For the Chinese Crested Dog I recommend foods that have a blend of fish and rice. These should be low in their fiber content. I also recommend you avoid feeding this breed a food with high carbohydrate percentages or meats like beef and horse meat. 98

CHINESE SHAR-PEI

Weight Standards: m/f - 55 to 65 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 18 to 22 inches Coat: Bristly textured, with loose folds, colors of solid fawn, red, black or chocolate Common Ailments: dysplasia, bloat, eye ailments, hot spots and skin pigmentation problems The Chinese Shar-Pei developed in China prior to the Han Dynasty (202 B.C. - 220 A.D.). This time period in China was the "Warring States period ". The breed of dog that emerged during this era was appropriate for the attitudes that prevailed. First bred to be fighting dogs, their owners developed a breed of dog that had very loose folds of skin so that their opponent could not easily get to a vital spot for the kill. Other physical characteristics of this breed are: they can have a blue black tongue; the texture of their coat hair is unlike that of any other breed's; They posses a jaw structure that is totally unique in canines. These unique physical characteristics suggest that this breed is unlike any other, just like their unique nutritional requirements. Native food supplies included beets, sweet potato and other tuber type ground vegetables. Grains were rice, corn, and wheat. Meats were poultry, oxen and pork. For the Chinese Shar-Pei I recommend foods that blend horse meat, poultry, beet pulp, wheat and rice. These should be high in their fiber and carbohydrate content. I also suggest that you avoid feeding a Chinese Shar-Pei any avocado, potato, ocean fish, beef or lamb. 99

CHOW CHOW

Weight Standards: m/f - average 70 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 20 inches Coat: long, dense, double, single color Common Ailments: hot spots, eye problems, ear infections The Chow Chow originated in China (Tibet) where it was raised as a meat source for human consumption. This was done on a scale that can be compared to the sheep ranches of New Zealand or the cattle ranches in our own country today. Since the Chow Chow was used as a meat source for human consumption, it was fed a diet of grains and vegetables. One indicator of the Chow Chow's development as a vegetarian is the difference in the mouth, jaw, and tooth structure from those breeds that developed as "meat eaters." For example, the Chow has a set of teeth that are flatter than the sharp incisors found in the carnivorous breeds. The Chow has two other distinctive physical features that are unique to this breed of dog; first, a blue-black tongue, and second, a lack of angulation in the lower joint of the hindlimbs. The primary food sources of the Chow Chow's native environment were rice, wheat, soy, and some occasional fish. Thus, a blend of these foods would be the ideal diet for the Chow Chow. Conversely, the worst blend would contain beef, horse meat, lamb, and poultry or any of their byproducts. 100

CLUMBER SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m - 70 to 85 lbs., f - 65 to 75 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 17 to 18 inches Coat: short & wavy with longer feathering, white or lemon colors Common Ailments: dysplasia, skin rashes and ear ailments The Clumber Spaniel developed prior to the French Revolution (1789) on the estate of a French nobleman, the Duc de Noialles . During the Revolution these dogs were taken to the Clumber Park Estate of the English Duke of Newcastle, who was a fancier of the breed and a friend of the Duc de Noialles . It was from the kennels on the English estate that the breed became popular. The breed bears its present name to honor their English Clumber Park home. This is the largest of the spaniels and their size is a definite nutritional factor when compared to other breeds. Most of their body weight is due to muscle fiber, which is heavier than fat on a square inch basis. Due to this feature they can store more protein for energy use than many retrievers that need high carbohydrate diets to fuel quick energy bursts for use during a hunt. Native food supplies for this breed would have been poultry of the game variety (chukker, quail etc.) and meats such as venison and mutton. The vegetables of their native environment would have been potatoes and cabbage and the grains would have been flax, wheat and corn. For the Clumber Spaniel I recommend foods with a blend of poultry, lamb, potato, wheat, and yellow corn. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a food containing white rice, fish, beef, or horse meat byproducts to this breed. 101

COLLIE

Weight Standards: m - 60 to 75 lbs., f - 50 to 60 lbs. Height Standards: m - 24 to 26 inches, f - 22 to 24 inches Coat: Long dense, straight outer coat-double coated with a very heavy undercoat. Blows coat 2-3 times a year normally Common Ailments: collie eye (detached retina), skin-coat problems The Collie originated in the Scottish Highlands as a herding dog for both sheep and cattle. First written about in the 14th century, it received its name from the type of animals with which it associated. Black faced sheep were called "Colleys"; therefore the dogs that drove them to market were called the "Colley dogs." The Collie has high requirements for both the mineral complex and fat soluble vitamins per pound of body weight when compared to many other breeds. .Fleischman laboratories established their vitamin D requirement in 1944. The Fleischman laboratories test shows the Collie to have a requirement for this one fat soluble vitamin over 9 times what other breeds require. The National Research Council used this report when they were considering the minimum amounts to recommend for all breed dog food. The report is cited on page 24, in the U.S. Government National Research Council publication Nutrient Requirements of Dogs, (1985 revised edition), The Collie thrives on a diet that is rich in low ground type vegetables. The ideal meat protein blend should include lamb and poultry with a limited amount of beef. Collies should avoid foods containing yellow corn, rice, fish or soy. 102

COTON DE TULEAR

Weight Standards: m/f - 12 to 15 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 10 to 12 inches Coat: long, and with the feel of cotton; color varies from white, white with champagne highlights, and a dusting of black hairs to white with black patches. Common Ailments: skin rashes, tooth loss & respiratory problems

The Coton de Tulear developed in Madagascar, which is now the Malagasy Republic. This is an island republic located about 250 miles off the African coast in the Indian Ocean. The Coton de Tulear is called the "Royal Dog of Madagascar" because it was once owned exclusively by the royal family of the island. On the island anyone else found with a dog of this breed in their possession risked being sentenced to death. Due to the original restrictions on the breeding and ownership of this breed, it remains today one of the world's rarest breeds.

Native food supplies found in Madagascar for this breed would have been similar to brown rice, goat, fish, pork and poultry.

For the Coton de Tulear I recommend a food that is a blend of brown rice, fish, avocado and poultry. I also suggest that you keep foods such as beef or horse meat out of their diet.

103

CURLY COATED RETRIEVER

Weight Standards: m/f - average 65 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 23.5 inches Coat: short and very curly, in colors of solid liver or black Common Ailments: dysplasia, liver and kidney failure

The Curly Coated Retriever developed in the 16th century as both an upland game dog and water retriever. An English sportsman used two breeds of Spaniel and a retrieving Setter to produce the Curly Coated Retriever we now know. It has an extremely steady temperament and is very good around children. As a retriever, it has a very tender mouth that will not damage the game. The Curly Coated Retriever is now the most popular retriever in both New Zealand and Australia.

Native food supplies for this breed and its forefathers would have been upland game birds, such as chukker and quail, and waterfowl, such as duck and goose. Grain crops of wheat and corn grew in this environment. These grains are still used by sportsmen today to attract wild game birds along their flyway.

For the Curly Coated Retriever I recommend foods that consist of poultry and wheat. The best blend for this breed should contain very high amounts of the poultry fat. I also recommend you avoid feeding a commercial food that contains any beef, soy or white rice to a Curly Coated Retriever. 104

DACHSHUND

Weight Standards: m/f -16 to 22 lbs. (miniature 10 to 12 lbs.) Height Standards: m/f - 9 to 10 inches, (miniature around 5 inches) Coat: three different coat types; 1) long and soft, 2) short and soft, 3) wire haired. Common Ailments: spinal disk problems The Dachshund originated in Germany as a hunting dog. They worked in packs and are keen nosed and tenacious in pursuit of their quarry. The specific part of Germany where they developed had rocky foothills housing wild boar and burrowing animals like badger and ground rodents. The Dachshund's long low body was ideal for going into the tunnel homes of this type of quarry. The area in Germany this breed can call home also produced many varieties of vegetables such as potatoes, cabbage, carrots, and greens. Nutrients from these vegetable sources have high amounts of fat soluble vitamins such as vitamin A as beta carotene; therefore, I feel today's Dachshund will do best on a diet with its vitamin A source being the molecular structure of beta carotene instead of palmitate or fish oil. Note: Many breeders claim the Dachshund requires a very high fat - low protein ratio in their food. Therefore, I suggest feeding this breed commercial dog food formulated for puppies during its entire life cycle. I feel the best food blend for the Dachshund will contain horse meat, wheat, yellow corn, and beef. The food sources to avoid with this breed include beet pulp, soy, and both the white and brown forms of rice. 105

DALMATIAN

Weight Standards: m - 55 to 65 lbs., f - 45 to 55 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 19 to 23 inches Coat: short and fine in white with black or liver spots Common Ailments: cataracts, skin rashes, hot spots, liver and kidney failure, deafness related to nerve impulse blockage The Dalmatian has been known world wide since the Middle Ages. The largest numbers of them are located in Central Europe and the British Islands Theories about the origins of this breed are numerous. The two most popular theories are that they developed either in Hungary or in Africa. Because of their coat, I would guess the warmer climate of Africa. Due to a Dalmatian fancier who was a friend, this was the first breed that came to my attention as having nutritional requirements different from other breeds of dogs. This is also a breed I cite when asked about the length of time it takes a dog to adapt to nutrients different from those found in its native environment. The Dalmatian has remained the same world wide for many centuries. Yet the ailments suffered by this one breed vary from one area to the next. I feel the different ailments suffered are a direct result of this one breed's exposure to different environmental food supplies. Today's Dalmatian seems to do best when fed a blend of lamb, poultry, and white rice. The commercial foods that seem to give this breed the most problems will contain soy, beef, or horse meat by-products, and high fiber products like wheat, oats, and yellow corn. 106

DANDIE DINMONT TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - 18 to 24 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 8 to 12 inches Coat: medium long & rough textured, in mustard or peppered color Common Ailments: kidney & liver failure, slipped stifle, and ear infections The Dandie Dinmont Terrier developed in the border country between England and Scotland. The first written report of this breed, in the early 1700's, described a mustard colored ratter and hunting dog used for otter and badger. They became popular and were renamed after Sir Walter Scott published the novel Guy Mannering in 1814. One character in the novel, Dandie Dinmont, owned a pack of pepper and mustard colored terriers. Sir Walter Scott described the dogs in such glowing terms that the pepper or mustard colored terriers of the north country became very popular throughout the British Empire. When the breed was registered in 1876 it bore the name Dandie Dinmont Terrier. Native food supplies for this breed came from the rocky soil of the border country and consisted of meats from rodent, otter, badger, and poultry. Vegetable crops were cabbage, potato, and carrots. For the Dandie I recommend foods that have a blend of poultry, horse meat, fish, and potato carbohydrates. To get this blend you may have to mix two commercial foods together. You should avoid feeding a Dandie any blends that contain soy, yellow corn, or beet pulp. 107

DOBERMAN PINSCHER

Weight Standards: m - 70 to 75 lbs., f - 60 to 65 lbs. Height Standards: m - 26 to 28 inches, f - 24 to 26 inches Coat: short and smooth in black with tan or red Common Ailments: circulatory problems, cold sensitive, bloat and kidney failure The Doberman Pinscher originated in the shadows of Germany's beer breweries. Today the Dobe is internationally renowned as a security dog. It has an extremely high degree of loyalty to its master and can be very territorial, yet its temperament also makes it good with children. The Doberman Pinscher needs a special blend to receive good bionutritive value from protein. When compared to other breeds of the same body weight, it requires higher amounts of certain amino acids. The protein should be high in Phenylalanine and Thyrosine. Since the bulk nutrients of the area where the Doberman Pinscher developed were high in these essential amino acids, this breed requires this same protein blend today. Food sources found in the Doberman Pinscher's native environment included grain crops used for brewing German beer with pork and beef meat sources. The protein sources I feel would be the best for this breed of dog are a blend of beef, corn, wheat, and horse meat. Conversely, the worst blend would contain high amounts of poultry, ocean fish, or white rice. 108

ENGLISH COCKER SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m - 28 to 34 lbs., f - 26 to 32 lbs. Height Standards: m - 16 to 17 inches, f - 15 to 16 inches Coat: flat, long and wavy in a variety of colors Common Ailments: hot spots and other skin and coat problems The English Cocker Spaniel can trace its origins to Spain just like most of the other "Spaniel" breeds. The breed became popular in the 14th century when imported to England as a woodland bird hunting dog. The woodland bird that this spaniel hunted was the Woodcock, commonly called a "Cocker"; therefore, this breed became known as a Cocker Spaniel. The English Cocker has a harder time adapting to food changes than does the American Cocker. We also see more obvious reactions to food allergies with this breed than their American relative. In this country the English Cocker suffers from many skin allergies that are not commonly found within the breed in their native England. I feel this is due to the water differences between these two areas compounded by the differences in mineral sources present in most commercial foods from these two countries. Native food supplies for this breed would have been very high in carbohydrate content. They included potatoes with other starchy vegetables, grains blended with meats from poultry (woodcock and other upland game birds), and mutton. For the English Cocker I recommend foods that contain poultry, lamb wheat, oats, and potato. Also the minerals should be from a gluconate form and not a sulfate source. I recommend that you avoid feeding an English Cocker soy, ocean fish, beef, or yellow corn. 109

ENGLISH FOXHOUND

Weight Standards: m/f - 70 to 75 pounds Height Standards: m - 24 inches, f - 23 inches Coat: short and smooth yet very thick, in white with black and brown tricolor Common Ailments: hot spots and liver failure The English Foxhound developed through very selective breeding on the hunting estates of England's upper crust. The breed has always been used for one purpose; that of running down the fox ahead of horsemen. They are a very lean and muscular breed. This physical characteristic of body fat to muscle tissue ratio is a nutritional factor that needs to be considered when looking at their food requirements. They can store large amounts of protein to supply their energy requirements during the hunt. They also require large quantities of water during this exercise. Food supplies for this breed included the fox, hare, and other small animals from their native environment combined with the type of vegetables and grain crops found in England's central farmlands. For the English Foxhound I recommend foods high in their fiber content. The carbohydrates should be from sources of potato, oats, and wheat with the meats from lean horse meat and beef. I also feel you should avoid feeding an English Foxhound any ocean fish, soy, poultry, or yellow corn. 110

ENGLISH SETTER

Weight Standards: m - 60 to 70 lbs., f - 50 to 60 lbs. Height Standards: m - 25 inches, f - 24 inches Coat: long and straight, silky, with feathering Common Ailments: dysplasia, hot spots and kidney failure The English Setter came to England in the 14th century from Spain. Its name comes from the way it "set" a game bird for the hunter to net. Today, most sportsmen consider this breed to be the most elegant gundog there is. The English Setter requires large amounts of arachidonic acid. It will produce this acid through natural body functions, if fed food sources that contain certain polyunsaturated fatty acids. These must contain the proper balance of linoleic, linolenic, and oleic acids. You can tell if an English Setter is receiving the proper diet and producing the required arachidonic acid by the gloss of the coat. The best sources of the polyunsaturated fatty acids for this breed are wheat germ oil or safflower oil. The worst balance of the fatty acids for this breed would be found in sources of beef fat or soy oils. The English Setter developed in an area of Spain that produced grain crops of wheat and brown rice, poultry (mainly game birds), and cattle. I feel the ideal diet for the English Setter is a blend of foods that are high in natural fiber with a high carbohydrate to low protein ratio. The best commercial food blend would contain poultry, lamb, and brown rice with wheat and yellow corn. Conversely the least desirable blend would contain horse meat, fish, rice, and soy. 111

ENGLISH SPRINGER SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m - 49 to 55 lbs., f - 44 to 50 lbs. Height Standards: m - 20 inches, f - 19 inches Coat: long, smooth, double, tricolored Common Ailments: thyroid disorders, hip dysplasia The English Springer Spaniel originated as an upland game bird hunting dog in Spain during the late 1200's and early 1300's. It was then taken to the British Islands where it completed its development into the English Springer we know today. They are named "Springer" because they were used to "spring" game for the sportsman's net and "Spaniel" because they came to England from Spain. This breed primarily developed on a diet of corn, wheat, and fowl (such as partridge, quail, and pheasant). English Springer Spaniel owners should be aware that protein from wild poultry sources has amino acid profiles that are quite different from those of chicken by-products used in many commercial all-breed dog foods. Therefore, this breed will require more than just chicken or chicken by-products as the meat protein in its food to come close to the best amino acid balance required. For the English Springer Spaniel I recommend a blend of corn, wheat, and lamb with chicken. The food also should be high in its poultry fat content. I also suggest that you avoid protein sources based on beet pulp or soy with beef or horse meat and their by-products for this breed.

112

ENGLISH TOY SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m/f - 9 to 12 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 9.5 inches Coat: long soft & wavy in red, red & white, black & tan or tricolor Common Ailments: subject to slipped stifle, eye lacerations and respiratory problems The English Toy Spaniel developed in England and was popular before the reign of William of Orange. It was a constant companion of the English Cocker Spaniel that developed in the same time and area. The English Toy Spaniel we know today is a product of selective breeding that took place just prior to the reign of Edward VII and bears little physical resemblance to its predecessors. In England and most of the world this breed's name is "THE KING CHARLES SPANIEL ". It is called "THE TOY SPANIEL " only in the United States and Canada. This is due to Edward VII's refusal to allow the name Toy Spaniel to become the registered name for this breed since it had so little in common with the other "Spaniel" breeds of England during the time of his reign. Native food supplies for this breed would have been the same as the English Cocker. They consisted of potatoes and other starchy vegetables blended with meats from wild poultry (woodcock and other upland game birds), and mutton. For the English Toy Spaniel I recommend foods that contain poultry, lamb, wheat, oats, and potato. I also recommend that you avoid feeding an English Toy Spaniel any soy products, ocean fish, beef, or yellow corn. 113

FIELD SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m/f - 35 to 50 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 18 inches Coat: short with a silky texture, in solid black, liver or mahogany Common Ailments: dysplasia, liver and kidney failure, respiratory problems The Field Spaniel has a history that closely resembles that of the English Cocker Spaniel. Its forefathers came to England from Spain, and English breeders developed it for hunting upland game birds. Today's Field Spaniel has gained respect of dog fanciers and is steadily gaining in popularity. However, at one time the breed suffered in popularity, and today remains one of the rarest of the sporting breeds. This loss of popularity started in England because of some breeders who were originally producing the Field Spaniel. In their effort to produce a sturdier dog than the English Cocker, they indiscriminately bred a dog with a number of negative traits. Concerned breeders removed these negative traits in later generations. Today's Field Spaniel is a well balanced and desirable hunting companion. Native food supplies for this breed would have been woodcock, chukker, quail, pheasant, and other upland game birds combined with the grain crops and vegetables found in middle latitude England. For the Field Spaniel I recommend foods that have a blend of wheat, oats, poultry, and lamb. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a Field Spaniel any soy, white rice, beet pulp, beef, and horse meats or their by-products. 114

FILA BRASILEIRO

Weight Standards: m/f - over 110 lbs. Height Standards: m - 27 to 29.5 inches, f - 26 to 28 inches Coat: short and dense in any color including brindle except white Common Ailments: dysplasia The Fila Brasileiro developed in Brazil as the result of crossbreeding select Portuguese herding breeds with the English Mastiff. It is a very courageous dog that hunts the Jaguar. It makes a great watchdog because it is territorial and loyal. However, these same traits can cause it to be overly aggressive with strangers. The Fila Brasileiro is a very heavy-boned breed that requires a high quantity of the mineral complex throughout its life to develop and maintain its skeletal structure. Also, it is a breed that is slow to mature (nutritionally), even though it reaches its adult body size in 18 to 24 months. Therefore, it should be kept on a puppy feeding program until fully developed at about 40 months of age. Native food supplies for this breed came from the border of the rain forest (selvas) in Brazil. These included cattle, sheep, mango Papaya, and brown rice. For the Fila Brasileiro I recommend foods that are high in their fiber content and have the meat sources from a beef and lamb blend. The food also should contain avocado, beet pulp, and brown rice. However, I feel you should avoid feeding this breed any poultry, white rice, or soy products. 115

FLAT-COATED RETRIEVER

Weight Standards: m/f - 60 to 70 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 23 inches Coat: soft with mild feathering, black in color Common Ailments: hot spots, dysplasia The Flat-Coated Retriever we know today developed as a result of dog fancier S.E. Shirley's efforts. S.E. Shirley lived in England and was also the founder of The Kennel Club of England in 1873. The breeds that Shirley used to develop the Flat-Coated Retriever were the Labrador Retriever, the St. Johns Newfoundland, and the Collie. In the late 1800's and early 1900's the Flat-Coated Retriever was one of the most popular show dogs in Britain. It has a wonderful temperament and is good in the home with children as well as being an excellent water retriever and field dog. When we are tracing the nutrients that would have played a role in this relatively new breed's development, we must consider its forefather's native food supplies. The native food supplies for each of these are listed in the chapters that pertain to the Flat-Coated's forefathers; the Labrador Retriever, the St. Johns Newfoundland and the Collie. For the Flat-Coated Retriever I recommend foods that are a blend of poultry, fish, wheat, oats, and yellow corn. However, I also recommend that you avoid feeding a Flat-Coated Retriever any soy products, beet pulp, and any red meats with low fat content. 116

FOX TERRIER

Weight Standards: m - average 18 lbs., f - average 16 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - less than 15.5 inches Coat: two types: Smooth variety - short, fine textured and smooth. Wirehaired variety - short, extremely dense and wiry (this type needs stripping). Both found in white with black, ginger or tan Common Ailments: nasal problems (drip), hot spots, hyperthyroid The Fox Terrier comes in two varieties. Both varieties of this one breed developed in England to hunt fox. They were first written about in the 18th century as able hunters that could "gallop and stay and follow their fox up a drain." To put this in lay terms, it means the Fox Terrier could keep up with the hounds and horse while it had a fox on the run. It then (because of its body size) could follow the fox into a hole to chase it out for the hunter. Both the smooth and wire varieties of this breed have been in the show ring in the United States for over 100 years. Because of their history as a hunting dog, Fox Terriers were shown in the sporting breed group. They were recently placed with the terrier group. Native food supplies for both varieties of this breed would have been the grain crops of England; those that would grow in the rocky soil in a damp climate, and meats from the fox, badger and other borough land game they hunted. For the Fox Terrier I recommend foods that contain beef, horse meat, and grains of oats, wheat, and yellow corn. However, I also recommend you avoid feeding a Fox Terrier any ocean variety of fish, soy, or white rice. 117

FRENCH BULLDOG

Weight Standards: m/f - under 28 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 11.5 inches Coat: short and smooth, in brindle, fawn or white Common Ailments: eye and respiratory problems The French Bulldog, Bouldouge Francais , was developed in France by a group of lace workers who emigrated from Nottingham, England. The dog that they brought with them was a toy sized English Bulldog. They selectively bred these to local dogs that had a unique head and ear shape. The results of this breeding program gave us a small breed with the classic body of a Bulldog and a unique domed shaped skull. The skull has a domed appearance because of its flatness between the ears and a slight curvature directly above the eyes. The ears are "bat ear" in shape and give the French Bulldog a quaint and inquiring look. Native food supplies for this breed would have been found in both the areas of Nottingham, England (located on the banks of the Trent River) and Central France. The grain crops of both areas are very similar with sugar beets being abundant. The other main crops are wheat, oats, and barley. The meat from both areas is also similar. It is from beef and dairy cattle raised for both tilling and food. For the French Bulldog I recommend foods that are a blend of beef, wheat, oats, and beet pulp. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a French Bulldog any soy products, avocado, or white rice. 118

GERMAN SHEPHERD DOG

Weight Standards: m - 80 to 85 lbs., f - 65 to 70 lbs. Height Standards: m - 24 to 26 inches, f - 22 to 24 inches Coat: dense, straight, short, tricolored Common Ailments: dysplasia, and gastric disorders The German Shepherd Dog originated in the Alsatian Region of Germany. Today it is used world wide as a sentry, police dog, tracker, drug dog, search and rescue dog, and guide dog for the blind. The official name for this breed is German Shepherd Dog , though it is often called the German Shepherd or just Shepherd. For many years this was the only breed shown at AKC shows within the U.S.A. that had the word dog in its official name. The German Shepherd Dog is unique because it has a very short colon in comparison to other breeds of the same body weight. For this reason a high fiber diet is required to slow the movement of food through this breed's digestive track, thereby allowing more time for the nutrients to be drawn out. This high fiber diet will result in a larger stool but better assimilation of the food. I caution that this fiber must be from the proper sources and the amount should be carefully controlled. Too much fiber or fiber of the wrong type can cause impacted bowels. The environment for the Alsatian Region of Germany provided this breed with primary food sources of beef, wheat, and leafy greens like cabbage and alfalfa. Thus, I recommend a blend of these food sources as the ideal base diet for the German Shepherd. Conversely, I feel the worst food blend for the German Shepherd Dog would contain fish, soy, or rice. 119

GERMAN SHORTHAIRED POINTER

Weight Standards: m - 55 to 70 lbs., f - 45 to 60 lbs. Height Standards: m - 23 to 25 inches, f - 21 to 23 inches Coat: short, single, smooth, liver and white Common Ailments: Dysplasia, an overeater The German Shorthaired Pointer can trace its origins to the 12th Century city of Constantinople. This city is now called Istanbul and is in today's country of Turkey. This breed is an all-purpose gun dog developed for the sportsman who wanted a companion that could hunt either fur or feather on land or water. The nutritional environment of 12th Century Constantinople would have provided meats of poultry, goat, and fish. The fruits would have included the fig, grape, orange, and olive. The predominant grains of the area were barley, a brown rice and wheat. This nutritional combination played a major role in determining the dietary requirements of the German Shorthaired Pointer. One result was that this breed developed a requirement for a high fat and oil content in its food from vegetable oils. Another is its need for proteins that are high in methionine (from the types of fruit named), and leucine and lysine (from the fish and poultry meat sources). I recommend you look for a food that contains a blend of poultry, fish, lamb, avocado, and wheat for this breed. I also recommend you avoid blends that contain beef by-products, soy, yellow corn, and beet pulp for a German Shorthaired Pointer. 120

GERMAN WIREHAIRED POINTER

Weight Standards: m - 60 to 75 lbs., f - 50 to 60 lbs. Height Standards: m - 24 to 26 inches, f - not under 22 inches Coat: double, top coat short, dense and wiry in liver & white Common Ailments: bloat, gas and other intestinal tract problems The German Wirehaired Pointer developed in Northern Germany because sportsmen wanted both a water retriever and a pointer of upland game-birds. This breed is a very heavy shedder in the warmer summer months. This seasonal shedding is a nutritional factor that should be considered in their dietary requirements. Since their coat's fiber is made from protein, their protein requirements change when it comes time to grow their winter coat. I suggest an increase in their dietary protein during the fall months to help produce the heavier new winter coat. The increase in the dietary protein content should be about 2% to 3% above their normal maintenance diet. This can be achieved by feeding them a commercial formula with the same base sources as in their everyday food, but with a higher protein amount. Note; Many puppy formulas would meet these changes. Once the new coat is set, they can then return to lower protein food for the balance of the year. Native food supplies for this breed would have been poultry of the game bird variety, mutton, pork, and fresh water fish. Also available was wheat with other high carbohydrate / starchy vegetables like cabbage and potato. For the German Wirehaired Pointer I recommend foods that are a blend of poultry, lamb, wheat, potato, and fish. I also recommend you avoid feeding a soy and white rice blend to a German Wirehaired Pointer. 121

GIANT SCHNAUZER

Weight Standards: m - 75 to 95 lbs., f - 75 to 85 lbs. Height Standards: m - 25.5 to 27.5 inches, f - 23.5 to 25.5 inches Coat: double coated, short, dense, very harsh texture with leg and chin feathering in solid black or salt and pepper Common Ailments: dysplasia and bloat The Giant Schnauzer developed in the German kingdoms of Wurttenberg and Bavaria where this dog was known as a "Munchener" in the early 15th century. The original development of this breed was from a line of the smaller Standard Schnauzers. German meat packers selectively bred these dogs to a larger size dog that could both herd and guard. A special note: this breed's skeletal system is not fully developed until about 36 months of age, even though a 12 month old puppy may have reached a full adult body size. Therefore, as with other breeds that are slow to develop nutritionally, this breed must be kept on a puppy diet until fully developed both internally as well as externally. Native food supplies for this breed would have included the type of grains used in the German breweries such as hops and flax with ground vegetables such as potato and cabbage. Also wheat and sugar beet were grown for the herds of beef cattle with which this breed associated. For the Giant Schnauzer I recommend foods that have beef as their meat source blended with beet and grains of wheat and corn. I also recommend that you avoid feeding a Giant Schnauzer any soy, white rice, or poultry. 122

GLEN OF IMAAL TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - up to 35 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 14 inches Coat: a harsh textured coat in blue, blue and tan or Wheaton color Common Ailments: hot spots, liver and kidney disorders The Glen of Imaal Terrier is a true dog of Ireland, with a history that dates from 2500 BC. It is a courageous breed that originally hunted badgers in the rocky cliffs of Wicklow County on the southeast coast of Ireland. One of the things this breed does differently than other Terriers is it will not bark or make any noise when fighting - even when taking on a fox or badger in the lair. Physically this breed is very heavily boned for its size. It also has a large chest to house a set of lungs that are very large for a dog of only 14 inches and 35 pounds. I feel that both of these physical features play a role in the unique nutritional requirements of this breed. Food supplies native to this breed would have been the ground animals it hunted. Both ocean and stream fish were a staple in its diet. The grain and vegetable crops native to Wicklow County Ireland would have included barley, oats, and potato. For the Glen of Imaal Terrier I recommend foods that are high in the protein from a fish source blended with barley, oats, potato, and a little beef. However, you should avoid feeding a Glen of Imaal Terrier anything you would not find in an Irish Stew, such as white rice, soy beans, beets, or avocado. 123

GOLDEN RETRIEVER

Weight Standards: m - 65 to 75 lbs., f - 60 to 70 lbs. Height Standards: m - 23 to 24 inches, f - 21.5 to 22.5 inches Coat: double, soft and long with mild feathering Common Ailments: dysplasia, congenital eye defects, hot spots The Golden Retriever's origins cannot be documented. The theories are as numerous as the breed itself. One theory claims the Golden Retriever originated in Russia and was then later taken to England where it developed into the breed of dog we know today. The Golden is one of six breeds I know of that produces oils through the skin and no skin dander. This makes it an ideal breed for people with allergies to the skin dander produced by most of the other breeds. Since the Golden produces skin oil and not skin dander, it is very important that they receive the proper amount and balance of dietary fatty acids. When the proper balance of fatty acids (linolenic, linoleic, and oleic) are present in its daily dietary intake, the Golden only produces the arachidonic acid its body requires to make the skin oils. The proper source and balance of these fatty acids can change a dry, dull and brittle coat into one that would make any Golden Retriever proud. The best sources of fatty acids for this breed of dog are linseed oil and cold pressed corn oil or wheat germ oils. Soy oil coat conditioners should be avoided. Wherever the Golden Retriever originated, nutrient sources in the regions must have included wheat, corn, poultry, and limited amounts of beef. A blend of these sources makes up the ideal base diet for this breed. Foods this breed should avoid would contain ocean fish, soy, oats, beet pulp, or white rice. 124

GORDON SETTER

Weight Standards: m - 55 to 80 lbs., f - 45 to 75 lbs. Height Standards: m - 24 to 27 inches, f - 23 to 26 inches Coat: long, smooth, double with very light feathering Common Ailments: dysplasia and hot spots The Gordon Setter is the only breed of dog called "Setter" originating in Scotland. The Duke of Gordon developed this specific breed at the kennels on his estate. He developed it to be both a working and hunting dog. They herded sheep and pointed to feathered game for sportsmen. This combination was ideal for gentlemen who needed a working dog for most of the week and a good hunting companion for the week end. The Gordon Setter has a special need for a high fat content diet. This need for additional dietary fat is especially high when the setter is working or when it is under stress. Large quantities of water must accompany the additional dietary fat intake during these times. A sure sign that the dog requires additional fat in its dietary intake is a brittle coat. When the Gordon has the proper amount of fat in the diet, its coat is very soft. The best sources of fats for this breed are vegetable or poultry fats. The worst source of fat for the Gordon Setter is beef fat. The Gordon Setter's native environment in Scotland provided food sources of potatoes, wheat, corn, and poultry of the wild game variety. Therefore, I recommend a blend of foods that are high in their carbohydrate-to-protein ratio as the ideal diet for the Gordon Setter. The blend I recommend would contain potatoes, wheat, corn, and poultry. Conversely, I feel the worst blend would be white rice, soy, beef, or horse meat and their by-products. 125

GREAT DANE

Weight Standards: m - 135 to 150 lbs., f - 120 to 135 lbs. Height Standards: m - over 30 inches, f - over 28 inches Coat: short, smooth with a harsh texture, in colors of brindle, fawn, harlequin or solid black Common Ailments: bloat, torsion, dysplasia, spinal disc problems The Great Dane, which is called the "Apollo of Dogs", developed in Germany where they were used as a hunter and a guard dog. Their original name was "The Deutsche Dogge", and at one time they were known to be so ferocious that the breed was considered vicious. They also had earned a reputation for being an excellent war dog. They could both pack gear and protect their masters backside from attack during a battle. I note that the "breed trait" of being ferocious is no longer evident. Today the Dane is (pound for pound) one of the most gentle and loving of the species canine. This is a breed that in its native environment is still being fed a diet of high fiber (whole rolled oats, cabbage, etc.) and high protein foods. I have seen fewer instances of bloat or torsion reported in its native Germany than I have in America. Therefore, for this special breed I recommend commercial foods that are very high in their fiber content. The food sources found in the native environment of the Dane included high fiber whole oats, cabbage, and rye. The meats were wild boar, deer, and a lean beef from a dairy cattle. I recommend a food for today's Dane that contains beef, whole oats, rye, and potato. I also recommend that you avoid feeding a commercial food with any soy, white rice, or fish to a Great Dane. 126

GREAT PYRENEES

Weight Standards: m - 100 to 125 lbs., f - 90 to 100 lbs. Height Standards: m - 27 to 32 inches, f - 25 to 29 inches Coat: double with heavy undercoat, long soft solid white top coat Common Ailments: dysplasia, hot spots and skin rashes, liver and kidney failure The Great Pyrenees developed in the Pyrenees mountains, on the border between France and Spain. This breed is one of the oldest domesticated breeds of dog with a history that has been traced to the Bronze Age (3500 to 4000 BC.). At that time it was used in its native environment for much the same purpose that it is used today; that of living in harmony with large flocks of sheep while protecting them from the bears and wolves. They possess great stamina, a keen sense of danger, and good fighting abilities. Due to its growing popularity, the Great Pyrenees Club of America has a code of ethics clause. Members will guarantee any puppy they sell to be free from hereditary defects to protect this breed. I applaud these people in their efforts to provide us with good and healthy dogs. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from their Pyrenees Mountain environment. The meat sources contained a very high fat to protein ratio. Any grains or vegetables would have been the type that could grow in a short season and rocky soil. For the Great Pyrenees I recommend foods of lamb, poultry, wheat, and potato. It must have a high fat content. I also recommend you avoid feeding a food that contains soy, beef or beef by-products, yellow corn, or beet pulp to this breed. 127

GREATER SWISS MOUNTAIN DOG

Weight Standards: m/f - 120 to 140 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 25 to 28 inches Coat: double, thick long topcoat, black with bronze & white Common Ailments: dysplasia, bloat, hot spots, kidney and liver problems The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog developed in the mountains of Switzerland in Central Europe. They have a history that dates from the time of Julius Caesar. They were draft dogs, herding dogs, watch dogs, and even battle companions. Nicknamed the "Swissy", it is one of four breeds known as the Swiss Sennenhunde (the four being the Swissy, Bernese Mountain Dog, Entlebucher, and Appenzeller). The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a very thick boned and heavily muscled animal, which can develop slower than other breeds. The thick bones and heavy muscles contribute to this breed's unique nutritional requirements. Therefore, the Swissy should be kept on a diet that will provide the proper nutrients for the development of bone and muscle tissue until fully developed. This can be long after the breed has reached its exterior adult body size. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from the mountain environment of the Swiss Alps. These consisted of mutton, poultry, goat, goat dairy products, and grains of wheat, oat, and corn. For the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog I recommend foods that contain poultry, lamb, wheat, oats, and corn. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a food that contains any ocean fish, citrus fruits or avocado, white rice, or soy products to this breed. 128

GREYHOUND

Weight Standards: m - 65 to 75 lbs., f - 60 to 65 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 27 to 28 inches Coat: short, single, smooth Common Ailments: bloat, PRA, circulatory problems The Greyhound originated in Egypt as a hunting dog and companion to the Pharaoh and his royal family. This Egyptian desert dog is depicted inside the pyramids of many Pharaohs. Most of us know of this breed because of its performance at the race track. However, it should be noted they make wonderful family companions, as long as they have the room to exercise. The Greyhound has unique circulatory problems directly related to its requirement for vitamins A, D, E, the mineral Selenium, and the trace mineral complex. The protein to fat requirements of this breed are very low when compared to other breeds of the same body weight. The fat should come from a vegetable or poultry source since those have the best balance for the Greyhound. Meat sources from their native area would have consisted of rabbit, pork, poultry, and goat. Fruits would have included the fig, grape, orange, and olive. Grains were barley, wheat, and a form of brown rice. There is no commercial food blend available in the U.S. that I would recommend for this breed. I applaud the trainers and handlers of the racing kennels for their efforts to make their own dog food. Food sources I think should be avoided by Greyhounds are beef by-products, soy, yellow corn, or beet pulp. 129

HARRIER

Weight Standards: m - 45 to 60 lbs., f - 40 to 55 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 19 to 21 inches Coat: short and smooth in white with black and tan Common Ailments: kidney failure, hot spots

The Harrier that we know today developed in England in the early 1200's and has one of the cleanest family tree records of any hound. Since there is an occasional puppy born with unusual coat coloring, there is a debate about the origins of the breed prior to the time records were kept on the first pack of Harriers. For five centuries we know this breed's breeding was confined to one pack, owned by a single family. The Virginia Colonial hunters used this excellent scent hound for tracking bear, boar and deer before we became a nation. They work well in a pack when hunting and have gained a good deal of respect from hunters in the southern states for their good nose and tenacity. Native food supplies that were available to this breed in their developing years would have been meats from fox, deer, and boar. Primary vegetables were the low ground type and grains were rye and wheat. For the Harrier I recommend foods that are a blend of horse meat, beef, and small amounts of poultry blended with wheat, oats, and yellow corn. Since you may not be able to find this recommended blend in any one commercial food, you may need to blend two foods to achieve this mix. I also recommend that you avoid feeding a Harrier any fish, beet pulp, soy, or white rice. 130

IBIZAN HOUND

Weight Standards: m/f - 45 to 75 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 25 to 29 inches Coat: short with a course texture in solid white or white with red Common Ailments: hot spots and skin rashes

The Ibizan Hound originated in the desert regions of the Middle East. The Earliest records we have of the Ibizan Hound come from the tomb of the Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamen. This breed was also known as the Galgo during the time of the Pharaohs. Egyptian gods and mortals such as Cleopatra considered it a favorite. Phoenician traders were responsible for this dog's likeness being placed on the Roman coins. They are also given credit for transporting this breed to the island of Ibiza in the early 8th century. There, this breed remained isolated from other dog breeds and was bred pure for centuries. It is from this small Balearic island that we have today's Ibizan Hound. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from their 8th century Balearic island home. They would have consisted of fish, rabbit, and goat meat with grains of wheat and a type of brown rice. For the Ibizan Hound I recommend foods that are a blend of poultry, lamb, brown rice and wheat. However, you should avoid feeding an Ibizan Hound any food that contains soy, beef, horse meat, potato, or white rice. 131

IRISH SETTER

Weight Standards: m - 70 lbs.; f - 60 lbs. Height Standards: m - 27 inches; f - 25 inches Coat: Long, flat, silky coat with feathering, Mahogany Common Ailments: hip dysplasia, bloat, PRA The Irish Setter's origins remain a mystery. We do know they became popular in Ireland soon after they first appeared there a few centuries ago and that most of today's Irish Setters can trace their linage to Irish kennels. They became popular because their performance as upland bird dogs was unparalleled. They are the tallest of the setters and one of the most handsome. The Irish Setter requires large amounts of fats, as well as a high carbohydrate to protein ratio in its base diet. It will produce a very healthy and shiny coat when the proper balance of fat-to-carbohydrateto-protein is provided. The source of the fat in the Irish Setter's diet is very important. The best sources would be from vegetable sources and the worst would be from animal sources, such as beef fat. This is due to the different sources of fats containing different amounts and ratios of the alpha-Linolenate family. When feeding the Irish Setter, just think of the ingredients for grandma's Irish Stew. These ingredients represent the food supplies found in Ireland for centuries. I think the best food blend for the Irish Setter should contain potatoes and other vegetables such as carrots, rye grains, with meat sources of lamb and poultry. Conversely, I think the least desirable blend would contain horse meat or beef and their by-products, with soy, fish, or rice. 132

IRISH TERRIER

Weight Standards: m - 27 lbs., f - 25 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 18 inches Coat: short with a soft undercoat and wiry top coat in shades of red Common Ailments: kidney and liver disorders The Irish Terrier was once known as the Irish Sporting Terrier in its native Ireland. The group of dogs collectively labeled the "Irish Sporting Terrier" included a rather mixed looking group of dogs with no breed standards. Breeders established standards after a show in Dublin, Ireland, in 1875, and the dogs conforming to these standards became the forefathers of today's Irish Terrier. The first records of this breed indicate they were a ratter and an upland game bird dog. They are very quick and agile and can catch a rabbit on the run or a woodcock before it can take wing. Native food supplies of Ireland for this breed would have been the potato, wheat, rye, flax, game birds of the woodcock variety, fish, and mutton. So when considering the food for this breed, remember the ingredients that would have gone into Irish Stew. These ingredients represent the food supplies that have been in Ireland for centuries. Also remember the number of rice paddies you can find in Ireland is zero. For the Irish Terrier I recommend foods containing potatoes, wheat, rye poultry, mutton (lamb), and fish. I also recommend that you avoid feeding an Irish Terrier any white rice, brown rice, avocado, or soy products. 133

IRISH WATER SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m - 55 to 65 lbs., f - 45 to 58 lbs. Height Standards: m - 22 to 24 inches, f - 21 to 23 inches Coat: dense undercoat with a curly top coat, in liver color Common Ailments: dysplasia, ear infections The Irish Water Spaniel developed on the north coast of Ireland as a water fowl retriever. Its history dates back to the 7th or 8th century. This is the tallest of the breeds called "Spaniel." The breed standards were established in 1850 after the breed gained in popularity in its native land, and local dog fanciers started promoting it. This dog is a natural retriever with a waterproof coat that makes it ideal for fetching birds brought down in extremely cold water. The Irish Water Spaniel is very territorial and protective of children given to its capable care, and yet it has a tendency to be a runner. This "running" characteristic may be to satisfy its curiosity more than to "get away from." This breed is very inquisitive, determined, and strong. Native food supplies for this breed would have included those found in both Spain and the Northern Irish Lake Country. These included fish, waterfowl, potato, and grains of flax, rye, and oat. For the Irish Water Spaniel I recommend foods high in their carbohydrates, with a blend of poultry, fresh water fish, potato, oats, and wheat. However, you should avoid feeding a special breed like this any soy, white rice, avocado, beef, or horse meat products. 134

IRISH WOLFHOUND

Weight Standards: m - over 120 lbs., f - over 105 lbs. Height Standards: m - above 32 inches, f - above 30 inches Coat: rough, short coat, gray, fawn, or brindle Common Ailments: dysplasia, bloat & gastrointestinal problems The Irish Wolfhound is one of the tallest of the breeds and one of the oldest. Its history can be traced to pre-Christian times when the Legions of Rome used it as a war dog. The Irish Wolfhound originated near Rome and was then brought to Ireland during an invasion by Roman troops. In Ireland it gained in popularity and is now their national dog. They are coveted for their hunting prowess; particularly for the pursuit and take-down of the Irish Elk, an animal that can be six feet tall at the shoulders. Nutrients of the Irish Wolfhound's native areas were very high in carbohydrates and fiber from grain sources. The best carbohydrate food sources for the Irish Wolfhound should come from wheat, barley, and potato products. Foods with carbohydrates from sources like white rice seem to be difficult for this breed to assimilate. Irish Wolfhounds also have a lower overall protein requirement per Kg. of body weight when compared to most other breeds of dogs. Therefore, I recommend that the bulk of energy producing ingredients in this breed's diet come from fat carbohydrate sources. My recommendation is for food with a high fiber, carbohydrate, and fat percentages. Horse meat seems to provide the best amino acid profile for this breed's requirements. I also think the Irish Wolfhound should avoid foods that contain fish, poultry, white rice, and soy. 135

ITALIAN GREYHOUND

Weight Standards: m/f - average 9 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 13 to 15 inches Coat: short and satin textured, any color except tan combined with another color Common Ailments: temperature sensitive, heart and circulatory problems, respiratory ailments and gum disease The Italian Greyhound originated in Italy. Roman soldiers brought it to Rome in 91 - 88 B.C.. Here it became popular and was given its modern day name. The first written word referring to this dog was uncovered in the ruins of Pompeii and was written on a plaque that read "Cave Canem ", which translates "don't step on our small dog ." This breed has experienced a decline in its life expectancy over the last century, and I blame this on the food that it is now fed. The history of the breed shows that the life span for this breed in the 16th and 17th centuries was from 15 to 17 years. This longevity is a very rare occurrence with the breed today. This breed is also prone to gum disease and tooth loss, which I also credit to nutritional factors. Native food supplies for the Italian Greyhound would have included fruits of the citrus variety, fig and grape, brown rice, rye, wheat, and meats from hare (rabbit), goat, pork, fish, and lamb. For the Italian Greyhound I recommend foods that are a blend of fish, poultry, lamb, brown rice, and avocado. However, I also recommend that you avoid feeding an Italian Greyhound any beef, horse meat, potato, beet pulp, or soy. 136

JAPANESE CHIN

Weight Standards: m - over 7 lbs., f - under 7 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 12 inches Coat: long fine overcoat in white with brown or black Common Ailments: gum disease, respiratory, kidney & liver failure The Japanese Chin developed in an area close to Peking, China. It was taken to the island empire of Japan in the 10th century where it became a favorite of the Emperor. It was often given as a ceremonial gift to royalty or visiting dignitaries. When Commodore Perry arrived in Japan he was given several Chins. In turn he gave his queen a breeding pair. She helped make this breed popular in England. Queen Alexandria was often painted with these small dogs in her lap or in her immediate surroundings. This breed has a profuse coat, which is a nutritional factor in the Chin's protein requirements. To grow and maintain its thick and luxurious coat this breed can require a higher amount of protein in its food than breeds with less coat per pound of body weight. Native food supplies for this breed would have been of the Mandarin Chinese variety with a later influence from the ocean fishing industry of Japan. These supplies would have included pork, fish, poultry with a high fat content, rice, soy products, and green's. For the Japanese Chin I recommend foods that consist of fish, poultry, white rice, yellow corn, beet pulp, and soy. I also recommend you avoid feeding a Japanese Chin any white potato, avocado, oats, beef, or horse meat. 137

KEESHOND

Weight Standards: m - 40 lbs., f - 35 lbs. Height Standards: m - 18 inches, f - 17 inches Coat: double, long stand-out top coat, silver gray shading to black Common Ailments: hot spots and skin rash The Keeshond, once known as the Dutch Barge Dog, originated in Holland which is now a province of the Netherlands. It served as a companion and watchdog in villages, farms, and on the canal barges. Other uses for this versatile breed of dog included hunter, herder, and draft dog. One physical feature of the Keeshond that affects its nutritional requirements is its continuous shedding. This year round shedding creates a need for a high protein diet. I recommend dietary protein contents as high as 30% in this breed's food, as long as the protein comes from the proper sources and contains the proper balance of amino acids. The primary food sources in the native environment of the Keeshond's low land Holland were ocean fish, dairy products, rice, beets, and poultry. For the Keeshond I recommend blending fish and poultry protein foods that have high fatty acid contents. The foods should also have a low carbohydrate to protein ratio. The carbohydrates should be from a rice or beet pulp source. Conversely, I believe the worst food blend for a Keeshond would contain yellow corn, soy, horse meat, or lamb. 138

KERRY BLUE TERRIER

Weight Standards: m - 33 to 40 lbs., f - slightly less Height Standards: m - 18 to 19.5 inches, f - 17.5 to 19 inches Coat: silky textured and wavy, kept short and is blue in color Common Ailments: skin rashes and coat pigmentation problems The Kerry Blue Terrier, whose coat has a unique blue coloring, can trace its origins and name to County Kerry, Ireland. This county houses both Macgillycuddy's Errks and Dingle Bay and is primarily known for its fishing industry, cattle ranching, and potato farming. County Kerry, Ireland is next to County Cork on the Southwestern tip of Ireland, where it juts into the North Atlantic Ocean. The breed of dog that came from this area was an all-purpose dog. It was first used by its human companions to control the vermin population, hunt small game, and be a guard dog. The Kerry Blue is a breed that does not shed its coat. This feature alone can make its nutritional requirements different from breeds of the same size that are heavy shedders. (See the Keeshond of Holland). Native food supplies common to this breed's County Kerry Ireland home were rodents, beef cattle, ocean fish, and vegetables of potato, carrot, and cabbage. For the Kerry Blue Terrier I recommend a blend of beef and fish with cabbage, carrots, and potato. You may not be able to find this combination and have to blend two or three ingredients into a commercial food. I also feel you should avoid feeding a Kerry Blue any citrus fruit, avocado, soy, or white rice. 139

KOMONDOR

Weight Standards: m - 95 lbs., f - 80 lbs. Height Standards: m - over 25.5 inches, f - over 23.5 inches Coat: dense undercoat with a long "corded" top coat in solid white Common Ailments: hip dysplasia, liver and kidney disorders The Komondor developed in Hungary from dogs first brought to the area by Russian Magyars in the 10th century. The Komondor is quite muscular with a unique muscle to body fat ratio. This physical characteristic gives them more stamina than many other breeds of the same body weight. This is due to the muscle tissue having greater energy storing capacity than equal amounts of body fat. The Komondor's coat is also unique for two reasons: most obvious is the coat's corded appearance; however, it also has a type of fiber that can take days to dry when wet. Both physical characteristics of muscle to fat ratio and coat type are factors contributing to the Komondor's unique nutritional requirements. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from both the steeps of Russia and later Hungary's low land farm belt. These area's are the bread basket of Europe and produce wheat, oats, barley, corn, sugar beets, hogs, and beef. For the Komondor I recommend foods that are a blend of beef, beet pulp, yellow corn, oats, and wheat. The food should be high in its fiber content as well. I also recommend you avoid feeding a Komondor any foods containing soy, white rice, ocean fish, or avocado. 140

KUVASZ

Weight Standards: m - average 80 lbs., f - average 75 lbs. Height Standards: m - 26 inches, f - somewhat less Coat: long top coat that is slightly wavy in white only Common Ailments: dysplasia The Kuvasz developed in the mountains of Hungary where it borders Czechoslovakia. This breed guarded noblemen during their journeys when it first appeared in this area in 1100 A.D.. It was later used to guard and herd flocks of sheep, and to hunt wild game. This dog has an unusually high instinct to protect children or helpless elderly. This trait makes them wonderful family pets. It is an extremely gentle dog for its size, yet it is also a strong willed herding dog. The Kuvasz's herding instinct is often used on those they consider in their care. They may take grandma or a small child to a place other than where they want to go. It is sometimes difficult for some people to remember that the Kuvasz does this "herding" out of love and devotion. Native meat supplies for this breed's development would have come from their mountain environment and therefore contained high amounts of body fat. The main meat sources would have been mutton, goat, wolf, bear, and venison. The carbohydrates of their diet would have come from oats and vegetables, such as corn and beets grown in the short summer months. For the Kuvasz I recommend foods with both the fat and protein sources from meats like mutton or poultry and not grain. You should avoid feeding a Kuvasz any foods that contain soy products (including soy "coat conditioners"), white rice, or salt water fish. 141

LABRADOR RETRIEVER

Weight Standards: m - 60 to 75 lbs., f - 55 to 70 lbs. Height Standards: m - 22.5 to 24.5 inches, f - 21.5 to 23.5 inches Coat: short, straight, hard, and dense; in black, yellow, or chocolate Common Ailments: hip dysplasia, hot spots The Labrador Retriever originated in Newfoundland and further developed in England. Besides being a famous gun dog, the Lab has become a renowned police and war dog and a trusted guide dog for the blind. The Labrador Retriever is also only one of the few breeds known to produce an oil through the pores of the skin. It will develop a very dry and brittle coat in a very short period of time when the entire Linoleic acid group is not present in its daily diet. The Linoleic acid group consist of three fatty acids: Oleic, Linolenic and Linoleic. The best commercial sources of these fatty acids for the Labrador Retriever are fish oil, linseed oil, or cold pressed wheat germ oil. In Newfoundland the primary food sources were caribou, fish, and whale fats. In England the food sources were poultry, fish, wheat, and dairy products. The combined effect of foods from these two areas resulted in the development of a breed requiring a diet low in carbohydrates yet high in fats. The source of the fat is also important; the Labrador Retriever has a difficult time assimilating beef fat but thrives on poultry fat, fish oil, or vegetable fats. For the Labrador Retriever I recommend foods that contain fish, poultry, lamb, and green vegetables. However, for this breed I suggest you avoid foods that are a blend of beef, beets, corn, and soy. 142

LAKELAND TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - 17 lbs. Height Standards: m - 13.5 to 15.5 inches, f - 12.5 to 14 inches Coat: a short and wiry double coat in black to Wheaton colors Common Ailments: hot spots and skin rashes The Lakeland Terrier developed in England's Cumberland County, a county that borders both Scotland and the Irish Sea. This county has some of the highest elevations in England, and it was from the heather moors of this region that the Lakeland Terrier originated. It was also from the many lakes in this region that the Lakeland came to be named. This breed was a working terrier. Its job was to kill fox that preyed on the farmers' new lambs and poultry. It also controlled the vermin population that lived in the storage bins and destroyed the grain. The Lakeland Terrier is tough, brave and agile, with a slender body that enables it to follow its quarry through narrow crevices. The Lakeland is also a very hardy dog that seems to adapt faster to different food sources than many other breeds. Native food supplies for this breed would have included lamb, poultry, hare, rodent, fish, and fox with high carbohydrate starchy vegetables and grains. Vegetables and grains would have been the potato, cabbage, carrot, oats, and rye grown in the podsols/bog type of soil of their heather moors homeland. For the Lakeland Terrier I recommend foods that are a blend of wheat, oats, lamb, poultry, and potato. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a Lakeland any soy, avocado, or other highly acidic fruits, white rice, or horse meat. 143

LHASA APSO

Weight Standards: m/f - 16 lbs. Height Standards: m - 10 to 11 inches, f - slightly smaller Coat: Long, dense straight coat, any color Common Ailments: kidney ailments The Lhasa Apso originated in the Himalayan Mountains of Tibet as the temple dog of the Dali Llama. Its primary function was that of a watchdog inside the palace. Its intelligence, acute hearing, and natural instinct for identifying friend from foe made the Lhasa uniquely suited for this role. The primary meats available as a food of Tibet would have been domesticated yak, mountain goat, bear, or lama. These meats have unique amino acid profiles when compared to meats usually used in commercial all-breed dog foods within the U.S.A. Their native home environment also produced barley and rice crops, which are grains high in fiber and carbohydrates. I feel that both of these grain crops influenced the nutritional requirements of the Lhasa Apso. They still require a diet that is higher in carbohydrates and fiber than many other breeds of dog of the same body size. Foods that the Lhasa Apso can use blend poultry, fish, rice, soy and wheat. I also recommend you avoid feeding a Lhasa Apso foods with sources that contain beef, yellow corn, beet pulp, or white potatoes. 144

MALTESE

Weight Standards: m/f - under 7 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 5 inches Coat: a long straight top coat, fine textured in solid white Common Ailments: slipped stifle, gum disease, respiratory The Maltese developed on the islands of Malta. These islands are a small chain in the Mediterranean Sea between the coast of Sicily and the coast of Africa. The Maltese were a favorite of the Greeks. Often these dogs were a subject for Greek artists during the 5th century, and tombs were erected for deceased pet Maltese. The Maltese dogs of Malta look the same today as they appear in portraits painted during the time of the Apostle Paul. The soil of the island of Malta is comprised of limestone, and the only fresh water comes from wells drilled into the limestone. I mention this because this soil's mineral content is credited with giving the Maltese breed a unique set of requirements for the mineral complex. You will know if this breed is receiving the proper minerals in its diet if its coat remains white and the eye drainage does not stain its face coat. When this breed is receiving the wrong food sources of minerals its coat yellows, and the face coat has a red streaking under the eyes. Native food supplies for this breed would have been goat, fish, poultry, and highly acidic fruits such as the orange, grape, fig, and avocado. The carbohydrates would have been supplied by grains of brown rice and barley. For the Maltese I recommend foods containing salt water fish, poultry, and lamb blended with brown rice, avocado, and wheat. You should avoid feeding a Maltese any sulfate minerals; as well as soy, horse meat, beef, or beet pulp. 145

MANCHESTER TERRIER (Standard & Toy)

Weight Standards: Standard: m/f - 13 to 22 lbs.; Toy: m/f - under 12 lbs. Height Standards: Standard: m/f - average 17 inches; Toy: m/f - 12 inches Coat: both sizes have short and smooth coats in black with tan Common Ailments: skin rashes, hot spots

The Manchester Terrier developed north of the township of Manchester, England. Originally called the Black and Tan, it was renamed Manchester Terrier in honor of a single breeder who lived in the township of Manchester, England. This one breeder took this terrier from the bloody sport of rat killing and made it a household pet. This breed is very quick and agile, a trait that made it good in the rat pit. For example, one of these dogs killed 100 rats in just 6 minutes and 13 seconds! The Toy Manchester Terrier was developed as a direct descendant of the larger Manchester Terrier by breeders who wanted a smaller variety of this breed. Both sizes of Manchester Terrier are very lean breeds of dog, having very little body fat. This body fat to muscle ratio is a factor in their nutritional requirements. They will do well on a food with a low fat content and can be taken off puppy formulas at an earlier age than many other breeds. Native food supplies would have included rodents, rabbit, beef, wheat, oats, sugar beet, and ground vegetables. For both sizes of Manchester Terrier I recommend foods that are low in fats yet high in carbohydrates and fiber. The ingredients I recommend are horse meat with oats, wheat, potato, and beet pulp. However, for these dogs I feel you should avoid feeding any food containing soy, rice, avocado, or yellow corn. 146

MASTIFF (English & Neapolitan)

Weight Standards: m - average 180 lbs., f - average 170 lbs. Height Standards: m - over 30 inches, f - over 27.5 inches Coat: short, dense in texture, colors of fawn, brindle or apricot Common Ailments: dysplasia, bloat, hot spots The English Mastiff developed in Great Britain prior to the Roman invasion in 55 B.C.. When the Romans invaded England, they were introduced to an impressively courageous and loyal dog. They brought selective breeding stock back to Italy, which in turn became known as the Neapolitan Mastiff. It was used in the Roman Circus to fight lions and bears. There is one story that tells of a single Mastiff fighting a bull elephant, AND WINNING! Native food supplies for the English Mastiff would have been venison, cattle, wheat, oats, and high carbohydrate sugar beet and potato. The Neapolitan Mastiff was then exposed to more vegetable oils while retaining an exposure to high carbohydrate foods from rye and brown rice sources. Both the English and Neapolitan variety are nutritionally different from a Tibetan Mastiff, a breed first appearing in Chinese literature around 1121 BC. For both the English and Neapolitan Mastiffs I recommend foods high in carbohydrates and fiber. Their foods should contain beef, wheat, and potato. With the Neapolitan Mastiff you also should include more fatty vegetable oils and some brown rice and avocado. With both you should avoid poultry, lamb, or soy. 147

MINIATURE PINSCHER

Weight Standards: m/f - 9 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 10 to 12.5 inches Coat: short and smooth textured, in reds or blacks with tan Common Ailments: hot spots, skin rashes, pigmentation problems, liver and kidney failure The Miniature Pinscher originated in Germany where its history goes back over many hundreds of years. It was originally a barnyard ratter. It is often called the Reh Pinscher in Germany because its appearance is similar to a native species of miniature deer. They are called the Miniature Pinscher in the U.S.A. because their appearance is very similar to a "miniaturized Doberman Pinscher." However, there is no genetic relationship between these two breeds. The Min Pin is wonderful with children and in a family environment. It is also very territorial and possessive. Therefore, it makes an excellent family watch dog. This breed is small and has a sleek appearance, yet it is very "thick boned." This characteristic gives it a different requirement for bone building minerals per pound of body weight than other "small" breeds that are more fragile or "thin boned." Food supplies from this breed's native environment would have been sugar beet, potato, cabbage, and meats from pork, venison, and rodents. For the Miniature Pinscher I recommend foods that are a blend of horse meat, beef, wheat, potatoes, yellow corn, and beet pulp. However, you should avoid feeding a commercial dog food that contains any ocean fish, soy, or rice to this breed. 148

MINIATURE SCHNAUZER

Weight Standards: m/f 14 to 17 lbs. Height Standards: m/f 12 to 14 inches Coat: hard & wiry in solid black or salt & pepper or black & silver Common Ailments: cataracts, kidney problems The Miniature Schnauzer developed in the farmlands of Germany. It was bred down to its present size by selectively breeding a larger variety of Schnauzer with other smaller German breeds. Which breeds these were has been the topic of many a lively debate amongst Miniature Schnauzer fanciers. Whatever these breeds were, today's Miniature Schnauzer has been in existence since the 15th century. It retained the Schnauzer appearance, with the abundant whiskers and leg furnishings, but developed its own charming personality. This combination of good looks and personality made it one of the most popular miniature breeds. There are very few breeds of dog that do not shed their coat. The Miniature Schnauzer is one of these rare nonshedders. This feature makes it an ideal pet for people with allergies and also gives it different dietary requirement for hair production than those breeds that are shedders. Native food supplies found in this breed's homeland would have been beet pulp, wheat, potatoes, cabbage, and meats from rodents and beef cattle. Therefore, for the Miniature Schnauzer I recommend foods that have a blend of horse meat, beef, potato, wheat, and beet pulp. However, I also feel you should avoid feeding a Miniature Schnauzer any soy bean products, avocado, ocean fish, white rice, or brown rice. 149

NEWFOUNDLAND

Weight Standards: m - average 150 lbs., f - average 120 lbs. Height Standards: m - average 28 inches, f - average 26 inches Coat: double, flat topcoat, black, black & white, bronze, or gray Common Ailments: dysplasia, skin rashes, hot spots and pigmentation problems The Newfoundland originated in the Canadian province of Newfoundland as the companion and co-worker of coastal fisherman. It is only one of six breeds of dog I know of with webbed feet. Nutritional studies of the Newfoundland showed a very high requirement for the fat soluble vitamins A-D-E per kilogram of body weight. However, for this breed these vitamins must come from the proper source. For example, Newfoundland dogs show a very low assimilation rate for vitamin A derived from beta carotene, usually found in carrots or vegetables. Yet vitamin A from fish liver oil or in a palmitate form has a much higher rate of assimilation for the Newfoundland. Nutrients in the Newfoundland's native environment consisted primarily of cold water white fish such as cod, halibut, and herring. Any exposure to meat would have been from caribou (which has an amino acid profile similar to that of horse meat) and bear (which has an amino acid profile similar to that of pork). For a Newfoundland I recommend you look for food blends containing fish, pork, poultry, and lamb. The food should have a high fat content. I also advise you to avoid foods composed of beef and soy or any food having a protein content over 30 percent or a high fiber content from oats, beets, or wood pulp. 150

NORFOLK TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - 11 to 12 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 10 inches Coat: hard textured and wiry in colors of Wheaton, red, tan or black Common Ailments: kidney ailments, hot spots and skin rashes

The Norfolk Terrier developed in the area surrounding Norfolk, England. In this farming community of Mideastern England this breed earned its keep as a barnyard ratter. This breed is often confused with the Norwich Terrier because of their similar appearance. The only exterior difference is that the Norfolk has dropped ears and the Norwich has pricked ears. However, these two breeds are different and cross breeding of the two can create problems. Their genetically different nutritional requirements create many of these problems. For example, the minerals the Norfolk Terrier can best assimilate are not the same as the minerals the Norwich can best assimilate. The native environment for the Norfolk would have provided food supplies from the farmlands. These would have included beef cattle, rodents, beets, wheat, potatoes, and other ground vegetables grown in the region's bogey marshland soil. For the Norfolk I recommend foods that are a blend of beef and horse meat with carbohydrates from potato, wheat, and beets. I also recommend you avoid feeding a Norfolk any foods that contain ocean fish, avocado, white rice, or soy bean products. 151

NORWEGIAN ELKHOUND

Weight Standards: m - 55 lbs., f - 48 lbs. Height Standards: m - 20.5 inches, f - 19.5 inches Coat: short undercoat & longer topcoat, silver gray black tipped Common Ailments: cysts, dysplasia and PRA The Norwegian Elkhound is the National Dog of Norway, where it developed prior to the time of the Vikings (800-1000 AD). They became the working companions of the Vikings and were held in high esteem by these people who inhabited this cold and rugged land. Many excavation sites have uncovered the body of a Norwegian Elkhound buried next to its Danish master. They pulled sleds, tended flocks of reindeer, hunted bear and moose, and guarded the family. The Norwegian Elkhound is a compact and well muscled dog that reflects the physical characteristics of a breed developed in a cold rugged country; a country where stamina, rather than flat land speed, was required to survive. Native food supplies for this breed would have come from the cold and rugged country of Norway. This environment's meat supply came from land animals such as the reindeer, elk, hare, lynx, wolf or bear, all high in their body fat content. The waters of Norway would have produced an abundance of both the salt water and fresh water fish. For the Norwegian Elkhound I recommend foods that are high in animal fats. The best blends will contain beef and horse meat, with an equal amount of fish. Any carbohydrates in the food can come from potato or wheat, but you should avoid feeding any white rice or soy based food to this breed. 152

NORWICH TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - 11 to 12 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 10 inches Coat: short and rough in texture, red, wheaton or brindle Common Ailments: hot spots and skin rashes The Norwich Terrier developed in Norwich, England, where the Yare and Wensum rivers join. These two rivers then travel the short distance to "Caister on the sea", where the North Sea meets the English Channel. This confluence of rivers close to the coast provided more of a port city environment than the barn yard environment of this breed's Norfolk Terrier ancestors. It also provided this breed with foods uncommon to its inland relatives. The Norwich continued to share many similar food sources with its inland relatives, such as rodents, beef, wheat, oats, potato, and other farmland products. However, it was also exposed to more fish and coastal type foods. I believe the acclamation to these coastal foods, with their different mineral sources, is what gave this breed its requirement for a coastal source of the mineral complex. For example, the Norwich Terrier seems to assimilate calcium from oyster shell better than calcium from bones of animals. For the Norwich Terrier I recommend foods that are a blend of fish with horse meats, beef, potato, wheat, and oats. The mineral sources that are best for this breed would include sea kelp, oyster shell, and gluconates. The mineral sources to avoid are from animal bone, sulfate or fumarate sources. Other nutrients you should avoid feeding a Norwich are white rice, soy, avocado, and citrus fruits. 153

NOVA SCOTIA DUCK TOLLING RETRIEVER

Weight Standards: m - 45 to 51 lbs., f - 37 to 43 lbs. Height Standards: m - 19 to 20 inches, f - 1 inch less Coat: medium top coat over dense undercoat, red or orange colors Common Ailments: hot spots and skin rashes

The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever developed in Yarmouth County on the Canadian island of Nova Scotia. Yarmouth County is located on the southern tip of Nova Scotia and is directly across a narrow North Atlantic waterway from the eastern coastal states of Maine and Massachusetts, U.S.A. The Canadian Kennel Club gave recognition to this breed in 1945 after it had been bred true for over 200 years. When recognized in 1945 its name was changed from the Little River Duck Dog to its present name. The "Tolling " part of its present name comes from a technique it uses when hunting. "Tolling " is an unusual technique of onshore antics also used by the wild fox to lure game birds in close for a kill. Native food supplies for this breed would have included fish of the ocean varieties, domestic poultry, and wild water fowl. There are very few grains native to Nova Scotia and the vegetable crops are limited. Also, records show livestock ranching was not introduced onto the island of Nova Scotia until the 1930's. Since this was long after the development of this breed of dog, their exposure to beef or pork would have been limited. For the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever I recommend foods that are a blend of fish, poultry, and potato with small amounts of wheat and oat. I also feel you should avoid feeding this breed any soy products, beef or horse meats, beet pulp, avocado, or rice. 154

OLD ENGLISH SHEEPDOG

Weight Standards: m - average 90 lbs., f - average 75 lbs. Height Standards: m - over 22 inches, f - slightly less Coat: long profuse and shaggy, in white with blue-grey, blue merle, steel-blue-grey, or black Common Ailments: hip dysplasia and cataracts The Old English Sheepdog developed in the western and central farmland areas of England. Originally drovers used this breed to herd livestock to market. The English government allowed a tax exemption during the 1700's for dogs the drovers used for their business of herding. The dogs the drovers used for herding were identified by a docked tail. The practice of docking a working dog's tail gave the dog a bobtailed appearance and thus its nickname "the bobtail." This breed is also a good upland retriever. The Old English Sheepdog has a very soft mouth that is good for retrieving a sportsman's kill without further damaging it. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from the western farmland region of England. They would have consisted of both mutton and a lean form of beef blended with the grain crops of wheat, corn, and oats. This area was also high in its production of beets, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables. For the Old English Sheepdog I recommend foods that are a blend of lamb, beef, beet pulp, wheat, corn, and potato. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a "bobtail" any ocean fish, poultry by-products, avocado, rice or soy. 155

OTTER HOUND

Weight Standards: m - 75 to 115 lbs., f - 65 to 100 lbs. Height Standards: m - 24 to 27 inches, f - 22 to 26 inches Coat: shaggy top coat, water resistant, in many colors Common Ailments: bloat, dysplasia, and hemophilia The Otter Hound developed in a region of England known for its many streams and excellent fishing. This breed can take a lot of credit for the good fish population in its homeland streams. It was this dog's job to hunt otter that robbed these streams of fish. Records show that the Otter Hound has been bred pure in their native England since the 1300's. Records of this breed also show that its popularity diminished to a point where there were less than 100 Otter Hounds in all of Britain in 1978. At that time Hunt members of the English Kennel Club sponsored a law making this breed a protected species in Britain. In the U.S.A. this breed is growing in popularity and has established itself as a fine hunter of the raccoon, bear, mink, and mountain lion. Native food supplies for this breed would have been the meats from otter, badger, fish, and rodent. Vegetables were of the type that could grow in the bogey soil of the English region where it developed. For the Otter Hound I recommend foods that are a blend of fish, poultry, and horse meats combined with potatoes and wheat. The food should have a very high fat content from fish oil or poultry fat. I also recommend that you avoid feeding an Otter Hound any soy products (this includes soy oil coat conditioners), yellow corn, avocado, or white rice. 156

PAPILLON

Weight Standards: m/f - average 8 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 8 to 11 inches Coat: long and silky in texture, in any color combined with white Common Ailments: slipped stifle, fractures easily The Papillon has been breeding true to its present day standards for the last 700 years in France. There are unsubstantiated rumors that over 700 years ago this breed lived in coastal Italy and came from a dwarf spaniel. The name "Papillon" in French means "butterfly " and relates to the breed's ears, which are mobile, erect and fringed with fine hair. There is also a white blaze that runs up the forehead of most of these dogs to further enhance the butterfly appearance. The Papillon also has what some may call a "dainty" appearance, but the breed is not at all what anyone could mistake for dainty. Historically they were a very active ratter and have always been a healthy breed. Native food supplies for this breed would have been the type found on a 16th century farm in Central France. The meats would have consisted of the farms' rodents, poultry, and mutton with crops of in ground vegetables, wheat, and corn. For the Papillon I recommend foods that are a blend of poultry, lamb, potato, wheat, and corn. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a Papillon any form of soy products, rice, ocean fish, horse meat, or beef. 157

PEKINGESE

Weight Standards: m/f - under 14 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 8 inches Coat: smooth, long top coat, any color but liver and white Common Ailments: eye lacerations, respiratory & spinal problems The Pekingese developed within the Summer Imperial Palace in Peking, China, during the 8th century. Ownership of this dog was restricted to the members of the Chinese Imperial Court. The Pekinese was considered to be a good luck charm for their owners. They were called by three names in their early years: Lion Dog (because of their appearance), Sun Dog, and Sleeve Dog (because they could be carried about in sleeves). Due to their confinement within the Imperial Palace, they were unknown to the outside world until the British invasion of the Palace in 1860. When the British troops invaded the Palace they found five of these small dogs guarding the body of their mistress, an imperial princess. These five were captured by the invading troops, taken to England, and are the forefathers of the Pekingese found in this country today. Native food supplies for this breed would have been those used in the kitchens of the Imperial Palace in Peking, China, and would have been foods of the Mandarin variety. They would have consisted of meats from fish, pork, and poultry with greens, beets, rice, and soy products. For the Pekingese of today I recommend commercial foods that are a blend of poultry, rice, yellow corn, beet, and soy. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a Pekingese any white potatoes, avocado, oats, beef, or horse meat. 158

PEMBROKE WELSH CORGI

Weight Standards: m - 30 lbs. or less, f - 28 lbs. or less Height Standards: m/f - 10 to 12 inches Coat: short & rough textured, red, red & black, or sable & white Common Ailments: hot spots, kidney and liver disorders The Pembroke Welsh Corgi developed in the area of Pembrokeshire, Wales. This area is on the southernmost part of Wales where St. Gowans Head protrudes into the Bristol Channel, close to the North Sea. This southern part of Wales has always been known for its mines and seaports, but it has never been good for growing any crops or farming. The first records we have of this single breed of dog are dated prior to 1100 A. D.. The records provide evidence that this breed has not changed since that time. Native food supplies for the Pembroke Welsh Corgi breed came from the Southern Coastal Region of Wales and, therefore, were very high in their mineral content. Since the mineral concentrations were high in this breed's native dietary intake, today's Pembroke Welsh Corgi's mineral requirement remains very high when compared to other breeds. Also, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi's dietary minerals of Calcium, Phosphorus, and Iodine should come from a coastal source. For the Pembroke Welsh Corgi I recommend foods that are a blend of fish, lamb, poultry, potato, beets, carrots, and barley. However, I feel you should avoid feeding this breed any horse meat, beef, soy, citrus fruits, or avocado. 159

PHARAOH HOUND

Weight Standards: m/f - average 45 to 55 lbs. Height Standards: m - 23 to 24 inches, f - 21 to 23 inches Coat: single, red, copper brown or tan, light flesh color nose Common Ailments: pigmentation, kidney and liver problems The Pharaoh Hound originated in the deserts of Egypt where it was revered by King Tutankhamen over 3000 years ago. It was then taken to the Mediterranean Islands of Gazo and Malta by Phoenician traders over 2000 years ago. It is from the stock bred true on these Mediterranean Islands for the last 2000 years that the world has today's Pharaoh Hounds. They were originally brought to the islands to control the rabbit populations and were extremely successful at their job. In appreciation for their work, they were declared the National Dog of Malta. This breed has many unique characteristics. Two of the most interesting physical characteristics are: they have an absence of "doggie odor" when wet, and they "blush" when excited. Native food supplies for this breed would have been desert gazelle, partridge, goat, rabbit, and fish with grains of brown rice and barley. There were also fruits like the olive and avocado. The mineral content of the drinking waters from their Mediterranean islands is also unique. The islands are comprised of limestone and all drinking water comes from wells drilled into this rock. For a Pharaoh Hound I recommend foods that use ocean fish, poultry, lamb, avocado, wheat, and corn. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a Pharaoh Hound any white rice, beef or horse meats, soy, beet pulp, or potato. 160

POINTER

Weight Standards: m - 55 to 75 lbs., f - 45 to 65 lbs. Height Standards: m - 25 to 28 inches, f - 23 to 26 inches Coat: short and dense in liver, lemon, black or orange with white Common Ailments: hip dysplasia, PRA, and cysts The Pointer is one breed of dog named for the work it does instead of its area of origin. The work at which it has always excelled is the pointing out of upland feathered game. This breed developed in Spain prior to the mid 1600's and was later refined into the Pointer of today by Major Arkwright in Great Britain. The Major selectively bred his kennel of Pointers with breeds like the Setter, Greyhound, and English Foxhound to develop a dog that was faster, had more stamina, and better scenting power than the dogs he first received from European hunting kennels. The Pointers brought to this country from Great Britain in 1880 set the breed standards for all of today's Pointers. Native food supplies found in the area of Spain where the first Pointer originated consisted of goat, fish, pork, poultry (woodcock, chukker, etc.), brown rice, and citrus fruits. During its short stay in England (about 200 years) it was exposed to more cattle and potato types of vegetables. This temporary change in available nutrients did not seem to change the long term dietary requirements of the Pointer. The Pointer still does better on brown rice than on English potatoes. For the Pointer I recommend foods that use a blend of brown rice, avocado, poultry, and fish. I also feel you should avoid feeding any soy, beet pulp, beef and horse meat or their by-products to this breed. 161

POMERANIAN

Weight Standards: m/f - 3 to 7 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 6 inches Coat: Dense stand-out coat, any color Common Ailments: slipped stifle The Pomeranian is a direct descendent of a thirty pound British herding dog transported to an area of North Central Europe during the Middle Ages. There this thirty pound dog was bred with a smaller breed from Iceland, known as a "Spits dog", and the breed we now know as the Pomeranian developed. The three pound dog that developed in this area is now the smallest member of the Spits family of dogs. It was for the Prussian province of Pomerania, where this cross breeding took place, that the resulting toy sized herding/Spits dog was named. Pomerania is in an area that is now part of Eastern Germany and Northwestern Poland. This historic region stretches along the Baltic Sea from a line west of Stralsund to the Vistula River in Poland. Principal crops of the Pomerania area included rye, oats, sugar beets, barley, and wheat. The meats of this area included beef cattle and pork as well as fish from both the Baltic Sea and many fresh water rivers. These food sources gave the Pomeranian its basic nutritional requirements. For this breed I recommend a food that is a blend of fish, beef, horse meat, rye wheat, and beet pulp. I also recommend that you do not feed a Pomeranian foods that include poultry, lamb, rice, or soy. 162

POODLE (Miniature)

Weight Standards: m/f - 15 to 17 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 11 to 15 inches Coat: Long, dense & harsh textured, curly when clipped, any color Common Ailments: PRA, eye and ear infections The Miniature Poodle developed in Northern Germany as a direct descendant of the Standard Poodle. It was selectively bred to its present size in its native Germany during the late 1500's and early 1600's. It has been reported that the Miniature Poodle has the keenest scenting ability of all Poodles, which makes it the best Poodle for finding a subterranean fungus called the truffle . Yet the Miniature is very much a water dog and only one of six dogs known to have webbed feet for swimming. The fact that they are first and foremost a water dog also brought about the "Poodle Cut", which was originally designed to lighten the dog's coat while swimming. This cut provides protective cover for the dog's joints and vital organs while in cold water. A multi-purpose dog, today it is the most popular of the Poodle breeds world-wide. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from the areas of the Black Forest to the Baltic Sea in Northern Germany. These would have consisted of fish, poultry, pork, venison, potato, cabbage, wheat, and corn. For the Miniature Poodle I recommend foods that are a blend of poultry, fish, wheat, oats, and corn. However, I also feel you should avoid feeding any beef, horse meat, soy, beet pulp, or avocado to a Miniature Poodle. 163

POODLE (Standard)

Weight Standards: m/f - 45 to 65 lbs. Height Standards: m - 24 to 26 inches, f - 22 to 24 inches Coat: Long, dense, harsh coat, curly when clipped, any color Common Ailments: PRA, eye & ear infections, bloat & dysplasia

The Standard Poodle originated in Northern Germany as a water fowl retriever. The breed name, which is shared by all sizes of "Poodle", comes from the German word puddeln ("to splash in the water"). The Standard has the longest history of all Poodles and the family tree for both the Miniature and Toy can be traced back to the Standard. The American Kennel Club recognizes the Standard as one part of the Poodles, with the only difference being size amongst the toy, miniature, and the Standard. Nutritionally, however, most Poodle breeders will tell you there are many differences per pound of body weight between the Standard Poodle and its relatives. The Standard Poodle requires protein with high amounts of the amino acid Phenylalanine. The Standard also requires substantial amounts of the mineral complex. When these are lacking in the Standard's diet, the most noticeable change usually occurs in the pigmentation of the skin, gums, and coat. When these nutrients are very low, or from the wrong source, the coat can turn orange in color and lose its luster, and the gums can become very loose around the teeth. The nutrients of the Northern German area where the Standard Poodle originated consisted of grains like wheat and corn and meat sources like fowl, fish, and pork. Therefore, I recommend foods with a blend of wheat, corn, fish, and poultry for the Standard Poodle. I also suggest that you avoid blends with soy, horse meat, beef by-products, or beet pulp for the Standard. 164

POODLE (Toy)

Weight Standards: m/f - 6 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 10 inches or under Coat: Long, dense, harsh coat, curly when clipped; any color Common Ailments: slipped stifle, PRA, runny eyes, ear infections The Toy Poodle was a favorite of the French Monarch Louis XVI and developed in France. This exposed it to nutrients that were very different from the native nutrients fed to its German forefathers; the Standard and Miniature Poodles. When researching this breed's dietary requirements, I discovered some interesting differences. The molecular form of calcium found in beef bone meal can cause the Toy Poodle dietary distress, but the molecular form of calcium found in oyster shells is assimilated well by the Toy Poodle. Also the fat soluble Vitamins A and D should be from palmitate or fish liver, and you should avoid vegetable sources such as beta carotene. You can judge a Toy Poodle's assimilation of these nutrients by observing the condition of the animal's skin and mouth tissue (please see chapter on A Home Health Check for Symptoms of Nutritional Problems ). Nutritionally, there are many differences per pound of body weight between the Toy Poodle and its larger relatives. The native foods of Central France where the Toy Poodle developed were much higher in carbohydrates than the foods of Northern Germany where their larger relatives developed. Therefore, I suggest a blend of horse meat with flax, wheat, oats, beets, and corn for the Toy. I also recommend that you do not feed this breed any food containing rice, soy, or avocado. 165

PORTUGUESE WATER DOG

Weight Standards: m - 42 to 60 lbs., f - 35 to 50 lbs. Height Standards: m - 20 to 23 inches, f - 17 to 21 inches Coat: profuse, in black, brown solid or combined with white Common Ailments: liver & kidney disorders, skin rashes, hot spots

The Portuguese Water Dog developed on the water off the coast of Portugal. They spent most of their life on the water as a working member of the fishing crew on Portuguese vessels. It was their job to be a ship to ship or ship to shore courier, dive for lost tackle, or drive schools of fish into the nets. These duties required a very special breed of dog. They had to have the stamina to swim for hours and the intelligence to be trained to do what most people would agree is very unusual work for a dog! Physically they are also very special when compared to many land breeds. They never shed their coat, their very lean body can store large energy reserves, and they have webbed feet for swimming. And yes, their special physical characteristics have also given them special dietary needs. Native food supplies for this breed would have been the same as any crew member on board an 8th century Portuguese fishing vessel and very different from a land animal's diet. They would have subsisted on a diet of fish blended with rice and nuts cooked in olive oil. Fruits were citrus fruits or dried figs. For the Portuguese Water Dog is one of the breeds that needs to have a food made for its unique requirements. I do recommend that you feed them their protein, vitamins and minerals from coastal or ocean sources and avoid products like beets, potatoes, soy, beef, or horse meat. 166

PUG

Weight Standards: m/f - 14 to 18 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 13 inches Coat: Short, glossy coat, black or fawn Common Ailments: eye lacerations, respiratory problems, heat prostration The Pug originated in the lowlands of Tibet, a very mountainous environment. The specific area the Pug can call home has an average elevation of 16,000 feet. This elevation affected the climate, natural vegetation, and wildlife. The Pug was no exception. The only meat sources available for the Pug to eat would have been native species of rodent, goat, deer, boar, horse, or Yak. Principal grain sources from this area would have included barley, rye, and mountain corn. Due to the mountain climate of Tibet, meat sources have a high fat content and the requirement of a high fat-to-protein ratio remains with this breed. There are no commercial all-breed dog foods providing the food sources upon which Pugs developed, and most food ingredients don't come close to the amino acid profiles of the breed's original nutrient sources. Yet this breed has demonstrated it can do well on a base diet that is high in animal fats from beef and horse meat. The protein content of the food should be kept very low. Any grains in the food should come from barley, wheat and rice. I also suggest that you avoid feeding a Pug any foods containing lamb, poultry, ocean fish, avocado, or yellow corn. 167

PULI

Weight Standards: m/f - average 30 lbs. Height Standards: m - 17 to 19 inches, f - 16 to 18 inches Coat: double, naturally corded long top coat, black, gray or white Common Ailments: dysplasia, skin ailments, pigmentation The Puli of today developed over the last 1000 years in Hungary. Before that time they were the working companions of the Magyars of Central Asia. They are the most popular breed of dog in Hungary today and have earned their popularity by being both hard workers and pleasant companions. They are very quick and agile, and the work that they do best is the herding of cattle and sheep. The region of Hungary that the Puli has lived in for the last 1000 years is known as the food basket of Europe. It grows many different crops and provides large amounts of meat for the rest of the European continent. Native food supplies for this breed would have been very diverse. They would have included crops such as wheat, barley, rye, flax, oats, sugar beet, potato, and greens. Meats included beef, lamb, poultry, and pork. This exposure to such a wide range of food sources has provided the Puli with an ability to use many commercial dog food formulas today. For the Puli I recommend foods that contains horse meat, beef, poultry, barley, oats, wheat, and sugar beet. The food should have a high fiber and protein content of about 24% to 26% but a very low fat content. I also feel that you should avoid feeding a Puli any soy products (including coat conditioners), avocado, white rice, or citrus products. 168

RHODESIAN RIDGEBACK

Weight Standards: m - 75 lbs., f - 65 lbs. Height Standards: m - 25 to 27 inches, f - 24 to 26 inches Coat: a short single and sleek coat, light to dark Wheaton in color Common Ailments: dermoid sinus, hot spots, pigmentation

The Rhodesian Ridgeback developed prior to the 16th century in Southern Africa. As one of the native South African ridged dogs, they were family pets and guard dogs. They are extremely protective of small children and protected the villagers' children from wild animals, including the Lion. Because they could hold a Lion at bay, big game hunters used this breed for commercial reasons. These hunters would have the dog hold a Lion at bay in order for their clients to take the time to make a good shot. Cornelius van Rooyen, a big game hunter from Rhodesia, is credited with making the breed known to the rest of the world. This breed is now named the Rhodesian Ridgeback because of where this one man hunted and because of a ridge of hair on the dog's back, which runs in the opposite direction to the rest of the coat. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from the African scrub. These consisted of lion, elephant, gazelle, zebra, wilder-beast, goat, poultry, rabbit, other small game animals, ground nuts (like a peanut), brown rice, and wheat. For the Rhodesian Ridgeback I recommend foods that are a blend of horse meat, poultry, lamb, wheat, avocado, and brown rice for this breed. I also suggest that you avoid feeding any white rice, beef, white potato, or soy (including any soy oil coat conditioners) to this breed. 169

ROTTWEILER

Weight Standards: m - average 115 lbs., f - average 100 lbs. Height Standards: m - 23 3/4 to 27 inches, f - 21 3/4 to 25 3/4 inches Coat: Short, flat coat, black with mahogany Common Ailments: hip dysplasia

The Rottweiler originated in Italy. It was brought to Southern Germany by Hannible as a guard dog and pack animal for his troops. It completed its development into the dog we know today in the township of Rotteil, Germany, which is a small hamlet in the foothills of the German Alps. It is from this small hamlet that this breed received its current name. Nutritionally the Rottweiler is a breed that should be treated as a puppy for 18 to 24 months, even though they usually reach their full adult size in 10 to 12 months. The Rottweiler's skeletal systems and muscle structure are both slow to develop. A 12-month-old dog may appear to be fully grown, but it is still a puppy in terms of its nutritional needs. When this breed is fed an adult dog food too early, there is a higher chance for developing dysplasia or other bone and muscle problems. When kept on the puppy formulas and schedules until they become adults (nutritionally) they will have fewer problems later. The nutrients of its native Italy included high carbohydrate grain products. The nutrients found in the mountains of Southern Germany were lamb, poultry, goat, and cheeses. Note: all of these nutrients are high in their fat content. I have found that the ideal base diet for the Rottweiler would consist of a blend of lamb, poultry, dairy products, and wheat. Foods for this breed to avoid would include fish, horse meat, beef, corn, soy, or white rice. 170

SAINT BERNARD

Weight Standards: m - around 165 lbs., f - around 145 lbs. Height Standards: m - over 27 1/2 inches, f - over 25 1/2 inches Coat: two varieties; short and long, in red and white with black Common Ailments: hip dysplasia, bloat, tumors, skin rashes The Saint Bernard was originally from the foothills of the Alps and a farmer's working companion. They were taken from their native environment to a Hospice in the Swiss Alps in 1660. It was here they performed the rescue work that made them famous. Monks from the Hospice du Grand St. Bernard identified some special characteristics in this breed that they felt made them very suitable to do rescue work in the mountains around the Hospice. These special characteristics were stamina, both a heavy double coat and a heavy fat layer to provide thermal protection from prolonged exposure in the snow, and an extraordinary sense of smell and hearing. Some of these same physical characteristics determine their unique nutritional requirements. Native food supplies for this breed would have been mutton, goat, dairy products, wheat, and low ground vegetables. The vegetables were the type that could grow in the short growing season found in the foothills of the Swiss Alps. For the Saint Bernard of today I recommend foods of lamb with wheat and potato. However, I also feel that you should avoid feeding a commercial food made with white rice, soy, yellow corn, avocado, horse meat or beef to this breed. 171

SALUKI

Weight Standards: m/f - 50 to 60 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 23-28 inches Coat: single, silky in texture, flat, in any color but solid black Common Ailments: circulatory problems, skin rashes and hot spots The Saluki developed in Ancient Mesopotamia prior to the invasion of the Persian Empire by Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.). Moslems inhabiting this area declared this breed sacred. It was the only animal allowed to sleep on the carpet of a Sheikh's tent. As a favorite of the sheiks, they were never sold but given as gifts. Because of this they became known as a breed of royalty. Mesopotamia (today's Egypt) is a hot and humid area. Therefore, unlike many breeds that developed thermal layers of fat to protect them from a cold environment, the Saluki is a breed with very little body fat. This physical characteristic is just one reason this breed has unique nutritional requirements. Foods found in their native environment would have included camel, goat, rabbit, poultry, other small desert game animals, brown rice, wheat, oils (olive), and citrus fruits. Food supplies that developed this breed were influenced by both the environment and the religious beliefs of their Moslem owners. The Moslem faith prohibits the consumption of beef in any form. Therefore, this breed would not have been exposed to this type of meat. For the Saluki I recommend foods that contain poultry, brown rice, wheat, and avocado. I also recommend that you avoid feeding any soy, white rice, beef, or horse meat to this breed. 172

SAMOYED

Weight Standards: m - 55 to 75 lbs., f - 40 to 55 lbs. Height Standards: m - 21 to 23 1/2 inches, f -19 to 21 inches Coat: Full, long top coat, white, biscuit Common Ailments: hip dysplasia The Samoyed originated in the area of the world know by modern man as Finland. They are named after the Samoyedes, nomadic tribesmen who domesticated and trained these dogs. These dogs were taught to guard and drive the tribe's reindeer and caribou herds in their Northern Arctic circle homeland. Samoyedes also used this breed as draft and sled dogs and household companions. As one of the larger breeds of the Spitz family of dogs, they have changed little over the last 2000 years. In fact this breed of dog has lain claim to being the most nearly akin to the primitive dog. I know of no other breed that disputes this claim. Principal nutrients of their native area have also changed very little in the past 2000 years. These nutrients consist of reindeer, fish, whale, and caribou meat with potatoes and fodder beets. Any grain crops would include a form of oats, wheat, and barley. For the Samoyed I recommend foods that are a blend of horse meat, poultry, and fish with wheat and potatoes. To the food I suggest you add about 1 teaspoon of Tuna fish for each adult feeding per day. The tuna should be the type canned in water. DO NOT USE TUNA CANNED IN SOY OIL! I also recommend that you avoid feeding the Samoyed any foods that contain avocado, lamb, soy, or yellow corn. 173

SCHIPPERKE

Weight Standards: m/f - 18 lbs. or under Height Standards: m/f - 12 to 23 inches Coat: Short dense under coat, stand-out top coat, black in color Common Ailments: hot spots and skin rashes The Schipperke developed in Flanders before the 12th century. This small lowland country became part of Belgium in 1830. The Schipperke was a barge dog and companion to the boatmen who worked the channels of this lowland country for centuries. The name Schipperke in Flemish means "little boatman." This breed also served as a ratter and carriage dog in the towns along the channels. A very active breed of dog, it burns calories at an exceptionally high rate on a per pound basis when compared with many lethargic breeds. Today's Schipperke is also one of the few breeds that lives an average of 15 to 16 years of age. Such longevity is a very rare occurrence within the canine family today. I attribute this longevity to this breed's efficient utilization of food and to its high activity level, which keeps it in good shape. Native food supplies for this breed would have consisted of both ocean and fresh water fish, dairy cattle, grains from the barges, beets, and other low ground type vegetables. For the Schipperke I recommend foods that contain an equal amount of beef blended with fish. The food also should contain wheat, oats yellow corn, and beets. I also feel you should avoid feeding a Schipperke any soy, avocado, white rice, lamb, or citrus products. 174

SCOTTISH DEERHOUND

Weight Standards: m - 85 to 110 lbs., f - 75 to 95 lbs. Height Standards: m - over 30 inches, f - over 28 inches Coat: short, harsh and ragged in various shades of gray Common Ailments: bloat and dysplasia The Scottish Deerhound is a direct descendant of an Egyptian desert sight hound. It was brought to Scotland by Phoenician traders prior to 1000 B.C.. In the Northern Highlands of Scotland their human companions used this breed to run down and kill the native species of deer. This species of deer can stand about six feet at the shoulder and has an average weight of 250 lbs. Therefore, this breed needed to be very fleet and very strong to do the job required. It has retained those breed specific physical attributes to this day. However, its waterproof and shaggy coat may have developed during its time in the Northern Highlands. Native food supplies from the Scottish Highlands included the venison from the Scottish deer, poultry, wheat, flax, corn, and potatoes. Foods from their Egyptian homeland would have included desert game animals, brown rice, citrus fruits, lamb and poultry. For the Scottish Deerhound I recommend foods that are very high in carbohydrates. These foods should use a blend of lamb, poultry, potatoes, wheat and corn. I also recommend that you should avoid feeding a Scottish Deerhound any beef, horse meat, soy, white rice, or beet pulp. 175

SCOTTISH TERRIER

Weight Standards: m - 19 to 22 lbs., f - 18 to 21 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - about 10 inches Coat: double with long topcoat (on sides), wiry in texture, black, wheaton or shades of brindle Common Ailments: skin ailments, hot spots, Scottie cramp The Scottish Terrier is the oldest pure highland terrier breed of dog. Records show they have not changed since the 1500's. They originally hunted the fox living in rocky boroughs of the Scottish Highlands. They were named for both their area of development as well as their Terrier heritage. First introduced into the dog show world in the early 1800's, they were shown as the "Hard - Haired Scotch Terrier". They were called this because of a rough and wiry topcoat. This wiry topcoat seems to be prevalent among all sizes of breeds that developed in the highlands of Scotland. This breed has a gait that is a peculiarity in itself, unlike any other breed of dog from Scotland or anywhere else. Many Scottie breeders claim this gait is a true indicator of the breed's unique personality. Native food supplies for this breed would have included mutton, poultry, and a form of dairy cattle now found in the Aberdeen Scotland area only. Predominant vegetable and grain crops were potatoes, corn, and wheat. For the Scottie I recommend foods that are high in their carbohydrates and low in their protein percentages. These foods should have a blend of poultry, mutton, wheat, corn, and potatoes. I also feel that you should avoid feeding a Scottish Terrier any horse meat, soy products, beet pulp, white rice, or avocado. 176

SEALYHAM TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - 23 to 24 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 10.5 inches Coat: A hard long top coat in solid white Common Ailments: spinal disc problems, skin rashes and hot spots The Sealyham Terrier is a new breed of dog. It developed on the Sealyham Estates of Captain John Edwards in Great Britain during the mid to late 1800's. Captain Edwards developed this breed by blending many other breeds of dog commonly found in the area of his Sealyham Estate. The breeds that are the forefathers of the Sealyham Terrier are the Bull Terrier, Corgi, Dandie Dinmont Terrier, Flanders Basset, Fox Terrier, Old English Terrier and West Highland Terrier. Captain Edward's goal was to develop a breed of terrier that was fearless and tough, fast enough to work with Otter Hounds as a hunt terrier, and agile enough to slip down a badger hole in pursuit of quarry. To trace the native food supplies for this breed we would have to consider all the breeds that went into the development of the Sealyham Terrier. However, this is very easy since they were all from the same area and were thus exposed to the same basic dietary environment. This environment would have provided these breeds with meats from their hunting, (the fox, otter, and badger), and with domesticated poultry and mutton. The vegetable crops were those that could grow in this area's rocky soil, such as cabbage, potatoes, wheat, and yellow corn. For the Sealyham Terrier I recommend foods that are a blend of horse meat, mutton, poultry, corn, wheat, and potatoes. However, I feel you should avoid feeding this breed any white rice, soy, avocado, or ocean fish. 177

SHETLAND SHEEPDOG

Weight Standards: m/f - average 18 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 13 to 16 inches Coat: Long, straight, dense coat, Collie colors Common Ailments: Collie Eye and epilepsy The Shetland Sheepdog originated on the Shetland Islands off the coast of Scotland. The dog's job was to control small flocks of sheep and to watch over toddlers at play. To this day, Shelties display a strong sense of boundary, a legacy from their earlier working days. The calcium source that the Sheltie best assimilates is also traced to its native environment. Breeders have found that calcium from animal bone sources can cause kidney stones in this breed. Yet calcium from a coastal ocean environment, like that found in oyster shells, is easily and completely assimilated. Also the unusual type of iodine contained in the soil on the Shetland Islands is credited with altering the thyroxine produced by the thyroid gland of the Sheltie's forefathers. Since thyroxine stimulates the pituitary gland and thus determines body size, the environmental effect created the "Small Collie" or Sheltie of today. Nutrients native to the Shetland Islands were all influenced by the environment's unique mineral balance. These included pork, goat, lamb, fish, and vegetables, such as potato, carrots, and cabbage. I recommend a blend of lamb, fish, potato, and barley for today's Shetland Sheepdog. Nutrients this breed should avoid are avocado, beef, soy, yellow corn, or beet meal. 178

SHIBA INU

Weight Standards: m/f - 45 to 55 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 14 to 16 inches Coat: double, topcoat hard textured, a variety of colors; redpeppered, black-peppered, solid black, black-brown, brindle or white Common Ailments: pigmentation problems, skin rashes, hot spots The Shiba Inu developed in Central Japan in the prefectures of Gifu, Nagano, and Toyama. This breed resembles a small Akita, which also developed in the same region. The Shiba Inu's name translates to "little dog." Therefore, it has been theorized that development of this breed came about through selective breeding of Akitas. However, I have found no records confirming this theory; and for all we know, the Akita could have developed from selective breeding of Shiba Inus. In Japan the Shiba Inu hunted small game, such as the squirrels, birds, and hare that lived in the foothills. Its quickness and legendary intelligence have been great assets. The native food supplies for this breed would have included meat from the small game they hunted. This meat was blended with rice, a tuber type of root much like our sweet potato, green vegetables, and cabbage. For the Shiba Inu I recommend foods that are a blend of poultry, lamb, white fish, and rice. I also recommend that you avoid feeding a Shiba Inu any yellow corn, white potato, beet pulp, beef, horse meat, avocado, or citrus product. 179

SHIH TZU

Weight Standards: m/f - 12 to 15 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 9 to 10 inches Coat: Long, dense, slightly wavy coat, all colors Common Ailments: eye, ear, and respiratory problems The Shih Tzu, the "lion dog", originated in Tibet. The forefathers of today's Shih Tzu were presented as a tribute gift of state to the Chinese emperor over 2000 years ago. At that time the emperor resided in an area now known as Peking. The exports of this breed to the rest of the world have come from this area of China. Therefore most people have forgotten its Tibetan origins and have given the people of Peking credit for both naming and developing this breed. Today's Shih Tzu requires a high animal and poultry fat diet at all stages of its life cycle. This is due to the original dietary sources for the Shih Tzu (both Tibet and Peking, China) being high in their fat-to-protein ratios. The Shih Tzu does not store this fat but converts it into energy within hours. For this reason it is best to feed this breed small quantities of foods with a high fat to protein ratio at frequent intervals daily. In its development the Shih Tzu enjoyed a diet consisting of poultry, pork, barley, rice, soy, and the castles' rodents. A blend of these nutrients would be best for the Shih Tzu today. I recommend a blend of poultry, soy, rice, and wheat. Conversely, I believe the least desirable blend for the Shih Tzu would consist of beef, yellow corn, or oats. 180

SIBERIAN HUSKY

Weight Standards: m - 45 to 60 lbs., f - 35 to 50 lbs. Height Standards: m - 21 to 23 1/2 inches, f - 20 to 22 inches Coat: Short, dense coat, all colors Common Ailments: hip dysplasia, PRA, cataracts The Siberian Husky originated in the steppes area of Siberia. This breed gained international recognition in 1925 when a dog sled team comprised of Sibes delivered diphtheria serum to Nome, Alaska, and an epidemic was diverted. This was done despite extremely adverse weather conditions and after many other dog teams comprised of other breeds had tried but failed. A statue of the lead dog from that team, Balto , now stands in Central Park, New York. When compared to other breeds, the Siberian Husky's need for carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight is very low. Yet, the breed has a high requirement for fatty acids. The breed's fatty acids must come from sources that contain the proper balance of linolenic, linoleic, and oleic acids. These three fatty acids must be balanced correctly for the Siberian Husky to convert them to the arachidonic acid its body makes. Also, the Siberian stands out nutritionally as the only breed of dog that I know of that has never had a reported case of salmon poisoning. The native diet of the Sibe consisted of salmon, fresh water fish, and animals like otter and mink that are very high in their fat content. For this breed I recommend food based on a blend of fish and poultry. These sources would provide the best sources of both fats and protein for a Siberian Husky. I also suggest you avoid dog foods based on beef, horse meat, soy, avocado, yellow corn, or beet pulp. 181

SILKY TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - 8 to 10 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 9 to 10 inches Coat: Long, straight, silky coat, blue-and-tan Common Ailments: Reportedly a hardy breed with few ailments The Silky Terrier, a relatively new breed, originated in the township of Sydney, Australia, in the late 1800's. It developed as the result of a cross breeding program between the Australian Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier. The Silky was developed for the sole purpose of being an attractive household pet. This breed is very easy going for a Terrier and thrives on a lot of companionship. Reportedly, table scraps that contain salts or beef fats can cause this breed nutritional problems. Also the Silky Terrier has very high requirements (based on Kilogram of body weight) for vitamins A, D, and E, and for the minerals copper, iodine, selenium, and zinc. These vitamins and minerals, however, must be in a specific balance for the Silky Terrier to use them. The nutrients found in the Silky Terrier's native environment of Australia would have included the meats from mutton, fish, and domesticated poultry. Grains and vegetable crops included wheat, rice, potatoes, and greens. I recommend food sources of poultry, lamb, fish, wheat, and dairy products as the ideal base diet for the Silky Terrier. I feel the worst blend for this breed would contain soy, yellow corn, horse meat, beef, or their by-products. 182

SKYE TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - average 28 lbs. Height Standards: m - 10 inches, f - 9.5 inches Coat: long and straight top coat, any color from cream to black Common Ailments: kidney & liver failure, hot spots & skin rashes The Skye Terrier developed on the island of Skye off the Northwestern Coast of Scotland. The records on this breed are complete and show that this breed has not changed at all in the last four centuries. It was kept isolated on the island of Skye and was not common to the whole of Scotland until the turn of this century. It then became a favorite of Queen Victoria and her patronage brought this breed popularity across Britain. Some unique physical characteristics of the Skye have also given it unique nutritional requirements. It is a very lean and muscular dog. It has a body weight to height ratio of about 3 lbs. per inch and its body length to height ratio is 2 to 1. This long and lean body not only gives it a unique appearance, but also a longer colon and a different muscle to body fat ratio than other breeds sharing same height or weight. Native food supplies for this breed would have been land meats and ocean fish that were very high in fatty acid content. The meats would have been from the otter, badger, and weasel they hunted as well as ocean fish, poultry, pork, and mutton. For the Skye Terrier I recommend foods that blend ocean white fish with horse meat, poultry, wheat, corn, and potatoes. They need to be very high in fatty acid content and you may need to combine two foods to achieve a proper blend. I also recommend you avoid feeding this breed any beef, avocado, citrus product, soy, or beet pulp. 183

SLOUGHI

Weight Standards: m/f - 45 to 55 lbs. Height Standards: m - 26 to 28 inches, f - 22 to 28 inches Coat: single, smooth textured, in solid shades of sand or fawn Common Ailments: bloat, PRA, circulatory problems The Sloughi developed in the deserts of Ethiopia over 5000 years ago. They hunted Gazelles and desert rabbit for the nomadic tribesmen of the area. Then during the Middle Ages, when their Arab owners were invading Central Africa, this breed accompanied them to the area bordering the Sahara and Tripolitania . It is in this area where the largest numbers of this breed can be found today. This breed has very little body fat. Its muscular frame is built for speed and it has a coat designed for living in a warm dry climate. I mention these physical characteristics because they are some reasons why the Sloughi must be fed a different type of food than a breed a heavy layer of body fat and a double thick insulating coat to protect its body from the cold. Native food supplies for this breed would have been meat from the desert rabbit, gazelle, camel, goat, and sage hen. The vegetable crops would have been of a tuber type or low ground variety and the primary grains were rice and wheat. For the Sloughi I recommend foods that are a blend of horse meat, poultry, brown rice, avocado, and wheat. However, I feel you should avoid feeding a Sloughi any soy, beet pulp, white rice, white potatoes, or beef. 184

SOFT-COATED WHEATEN TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - average 35 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 18 inches Coat: long top coat, wavy & silky textured, solid wheaten in color Common Ailments: liver failure, hot spots The Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier developed in Ireland prior to the 18th century. There is very little written about this breed prior to 200 years ago. Yet it is generally accepted that this breed existed in Ireland before the Kerry Blue (another Terrier of Irish origins). The SoftCoated Wheaten Terrier's coat is its trademark and its namesake. The coat is both soft and wheaten in color. Even the pups born with a darker coat will change to this unique color of gold as they mature. This change in color can be used as a guideline for changing the food from a puppy formula to an adult maintenance formula. I mention this time of change since this breed is much slower to mature than many other breeds of the same body weight. To remove them from puppy formulas too early can harm them later. Native food supplies for this breed would have been the same ones that come to mind when you think of Irish stew: a blend of lamb, carrots, barley, potato, and a slice of rye on the side. The other meats that they were exposed to were rodents and a very lean form of beef. For the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier I recommend foods that use lamb, barley, rye, and potato. However, I feel you should avoid feeding any foods containing white rice, soy, or yellow corn to this breed. Also avoid any soy oil based coat conditioners. The oil based coat conditioners that are best for this breed have a base of linseed or wheat germ oils. 185

STAFFORDSHIRE BULL TERRIER

Weight Standards: m - 28 to 38 lbs., f - 24 to 34 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 14 to 16 inches Coat: short and smooth, in all colors except black and tan or liver Common Ailments: circulatory & respiratory problems, skin rashes The Staffordshire Bull Terrier developed in England. It was named for the area were it was most popular. It is the oldest of all the Bull and Terrier breeds, including the American Staffordshire or Pit Bull and the English Bull Terrier. Yet ironically, this breed was the last of the Bull and Terrier breeds to be registered by either the Kennel Club of England or the American Kennel Club. This dog developed from cross breeding dogs used in the blood sports of bull baiting and bear baiting. Today it retains the physical traits required to excel in the ring. However, the psychological mind set for being a champion in the blood sport ring was never a "trait of the breed" and each dog had to be trained in this skill. Without cruel blood sport training, this breed demonstrates a quiet trustworthy stable personality. Their gentleness with children, the elderly, and friends is legendary. Native food supplies for this breed would have been those of the English country and consisted of beef, wheat, corn, potatoes, carrots, and cabbage. For the Staffordshire Bull Terrier I recommend foods that are a blend of beef, wheat, corn, potatoes, carrots, and cabbage. However, I also feel you should avoid feeding this breed any rice (white or brown), soy, or avocado. 186

STANDARD SCHNAUZER

Weight Standards: m - 40 to 50 lbs., f - 30 to 40 lbs. Height Standards: m - 18.5 to 19.5 inches, f - 17.5 to 18.5 inches Coat: Hard & wiry topcoat, solid black or salt & pepper coloring Common Ailments: dysplasia and tumors The Standard Schnauzer developed prior to the 15th century in Germany. It is the oldest of all the Schnauzer dog family. Both the miniature and giant Schnauzer are its direct descendants. The breed was known in its native Germany as the "Wirehaired Pinscher Breed" until the late 1800's. They then became known as the Schnauzer when a dog of that name won top honors at an exhibition. This dog's name "Schnauzer" referred to a physical characteristic shared by all members of this breed; their whiskered snout. This breed has other physical characteristics that make it unique in the canine world. They possess characteristics like their sinewy and compact body or their seemingly unlimited reserves of energy. Like this breed's unique temperament and physical characteristics, they have specific nutritional needs. Native food supplies for this breed would have been the same as those we associate with a heavy German meal today. The menu would consist of beef or pork, potatoes, carrots, and cabbage with rye bread on the side. For the Standard Schnauzer I recommend foods that use beef, rye wheat, and potatoes. I also recommend that you avoid feeding any commercial food containing soy products, white rice, or avocado to this breed. 187

SUSSEX SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m/f - 35 to 45 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 15 inches Coat: long and very thick, slightly wavy, golden - liver in color Common Ailments: kidney and liver failure, hot spots The Sussex Spaniel, as with most of the Spaniels, can trace its history back to Spain. Like most of the Spaniels that were taken from the continent to Britain, a lasting effect was made on this breed by the dog fanciers of their new homeland. An English dog fancier, Mr. Fuller, developed a line that had a very unique coat coloring. The coloring that Mr. Fuller's breeding program produced was a golden - liver. This is now considered to be one of the distinguishing features of a pure bred Sussex Spaniel today. This coat is also very thick in its texture as well as abundant in quantity. This coat gives the Sussex Spaniel a requirement for higher amounts of the amino acids Valine, Isoleucine, and Leucine than other breeds that have a thinner or single coat. Native food supplies for this breed would have been poultry, such as woodcock and chukker (which have amino acid profiles high in Valine, Isoleucine and Leucine) blended with grains of corn, flax, and wheat. Vegetables included the potato, carrot, and beet. For the Sussex Spaniel I recommend foods that contain poultry and a small amount of beef blended with potato, yellow corn, and wheat. However, I also feel you should avoid feeding a Sussex Spaniel any white rice, soy (which is very low in the amino acids Valine, Isoleucine and Leucine), or ocean fish. 188

SWEDISH VALHUND

Weight Standards: m/f - 20 to 40 lbs. Height Standards: m/f average 13 inches Coat: double, thick, in gray or red sable coloring Common Ailments: hot spots, skin rashes, kidney & liver problems The Swedish Valhund (Vastogotpet ) developed in the areas bordering the fiords in the cold and rugged land of Sweden. They are a member of the Spitz dog family. They were also the companions of the Viking tribes that inhabited this rugged country as far back as the 9th century. The Swedish Valhund (Vastogotpet) stands only 13 inches high but can weigh 40 pounds. When compared to the world wide "average 40 pound dog" that stands 19 inches in height, one can see many physical characteristics that give this breed different nutritional requirements than other breeds. Their long body gives them a longer colon than 40 pound breeds with shorter body lengths. Their heavy layer of body fat gives them different requirements than 40 pound breeds that are leaner. Their thick double coat requires different amounts of amino acids, vitamins, and minerals than 40 pound breeds with a thin single coat. Native meat supplies for this breed would have been North Atlantic fish, reindeer, and bear (all high in body fats). Vegetables were of the tuber type with a grain that could grow in a short growing season. For this breed I recommend foods high in fat and low in protein from food sources like fish and horse meat blended with wheat, beet pulp, and potato. However, I suggest you avoid feeding a food that contains soy, white rice, or citrus products of any kind to this breed. 189

TIBETAN MASTIFF

Weight Standards: m/f - over 175 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - over 27.5 inches Coat: thick, double, medium length, black or black with tan or gold Common Ailments: dysplasia, hot spots, pigmentation problems

The Tibetan Mastiff developed in the foothills of Tibet, China. These foothills have an average elevation of 16,000 feet above sea level. This high elevation environment gave the breed its thick coat and a layer of body fat not found in the Mastiff breeds of the lower elevations and warmer climates. The high elevation environment also affected this Mastiff's nutritional requirements, making them as different from their English or Neapolitan relatives as their respective coats and coloring. The first written records pertaining to this breed appeared in Chinese literature around 1121 B.C. Later, when Marco Polo was in the far east he referred to this breed in his reports. These two early accounts provide evidence that todays Tibetan Mastiff has changed very little over the last 3000 years. Native food supplies for this breed would have included meats of the horse, mountain goat, yak, llama, and oxen. The grains and vegetables are those that can grow in a very short season in rocky soil, like barley and rice or a tuber root that can be compared to our sweet potato. The Tibetan Mastiff has a dietary requirement for foods high in animal fat. They will not do well on the vegetable fats I recommend for its Neapolitan relatives. For the Tibetan Mastiff I recommend foods that contain horse meat, barley, white rice, and beet pulp. I also recommend you avoid feeding this breed any potatoes, citrus products, avocado, or ocean fish. 190

TIBETAN SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m/f - 9 to 15 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 10 inches Coat: double, silky textured, top coat is long & lays flat, all colors Common Ailments: kidney stones, liver failure The Tibetan Spaniel developed in Tibet before the Shang Dynasty in 1100 B. C.. The records show that they have been bred pure in this part of the world since that time. In the canine kingdom this breed can claim to be one of the oldest pure bred dogs in the world. It is one of the few breeds with the Spaniel nomenclature lacking any lineage to Spanish origins. In the Middle Ages French literature described a dog called an Epagneul as comforter and companion to ladies of the Oriental courts. Somehow this Epagneul became the modern Spaniel part of this breed's name. An indoor dog, this is the only breed from Tibet that has a "hare foot" (the two center toes being long). All the other Tibetan breeds have the more compact "cat foot" shape, better suited for walking in the snow. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from an environment with an average elevation of 16,000 feet above sea level. The domesticated meat animals are Yak, Llama, and Oxen. The grains and vegetables are those that can grow in a very short season in rocky soil, like barley or a tuber root that can be compared to our sweet potato. For the Tibetan Spaniel I recommend foods that contain horse meat, barley, white rice, and beet pulp. I also recommend you avoid feeding a Tibetan Spaniel any carbohydrates from white potatoes, any citrus products, avocado, or any ocean fish. 191

TIBETAN TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - 22 to 23 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - 14 to 16 inches Coat: double, long top coat; both top and undercoat are fine textured and profuse, all colors except chocolate are acceptable Common Ailments: eye problems, hot spots The Tibetan Terrier originated in the Lost Valley of Tibet. It was considered a good luck dog and was often given as a gift to a traveler who successfully made the hazardous journey into this remote Tibetan valley. They were never sold since this could tempt fate. Their homeland valley is high in the Himalayan Mountains and the floor of this valley has an elevation of 10,000 feet above sea level. This environment gave the Tibetan Terrier both unique nutritional requirements and some unique physical characteristics. A British dog fancier, Dr. Greig, brought some to Britain after he came across this unique breed of dog in India. In Britain they were called a Terrier because of their body size. However, it should be noted that the only similarity they have to any other breed that bears the name Terrier is their size. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from an environment where the meat animals are Yak, Llama, and Oxen. The grains and vegetables are those that can grow in a very short season in rocky soil like barley or a tuber root that can be compared to our sweet potato. For the Tibetan Terrier I recommend foods that have a base from horse meat, barley, white rice, and beet pulp. I also recommend you avoid feeding a Tibetan Terrier any potato, citrus product, avocado, or ocean fish. 192

VIZSLA

Weight Standards: m/f - average 50 lbs. Height Standards: m - 22 to 24 inches, f - 21 to 23 inches Coat: short but very dense, fine textured, in a golden rust color only Common Ailments: dysplasia, skin rashes and hot spots The Vizsla developed in the Great Plains area of Hungary on the border of Rumania. This breed of dog hunted both upland game and waterfowl since it was first bred pure in its native land. The breed suffered great losses between the two world wars of 1914 and 1939, and by the end of WW II in Hungary (1941) the breed was almost extinct. Saved by local dog fanciers, it is now back as one of the most popular breeds in Hungary and is honored as their national dog. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from an area of continental Europe long known as the food basket of the continent. Over 90 % of the land in the Great Plain of Hungary is under cultivation with 60% of that land being set aside for grain production. The crops of wheat, barley, rye, and oats are the principal grains produced. The most prevalent meats are from cattle, pigs, sheep, and poultry. For the Vizsla I recommend food that is a blend of poultry, wheat, barley, and rye mixed with a second food that is a blend of horse meat and oats. This will give the Vizsla the high fiber and balance of protein it requires. However, you should avoid feeding them any food that contains soy bean products of any kind (including soy oil coat conditioners), white rice, avocado or beet pulp. 193

WEIMARANER

Weight Standards: m - 70 to 85 lbs., f - 55 to 70 lbs. Height Standards: m - 25 to 27 inches, f - 23 to 25 inches Coat: short sleek and gray in color Common Ailments: bloat and dysplasia The Weimaraner developed in Germany during the late 1700's and early 1800's in the Weimar Court, a township in the foothills of the German Alps close to Bavaria. Originally called the Weimar Pointer in their native land, they hunted the wolves, wildcats, mountain lions, and bear from the surrounding mountains. After these animals of prey became rare or extinct in the Weimaraner's native area, the breed then hunted the smaller fur bearing game and upland game birds of the area. They excelled as a bird dog because of their very soft mouth and were well established as a retriever for both upland birds and waterfowl when they first entered this country. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from the Weimar Township area of Germany. The soil here is not noted for its fertility and has a unique mineral content. I associate this soil's unique mineral content with this breed's unique mineral requirements. Food crops of the area include the potato, cabbage, alfalfa, and barley with meats like pork, poultry, beef, goat, and deer. For the Weimaraner I recommend foods that are high in animal fat from lamb and poultry. The overall food blend should be poultry first, lamb second, potato third and then a blend of grains like wheat and barley. I feel you should avoid feeding a Weimaraner any ocean fish, beet pulp, white rice, or soy. 194

WELSH SPRINGER SPANIEL

Weight Standards: m/f - average 40 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 17 inches Coat: flat, silky textured with mild feathering, red & white in color Common Ailments: epilepsy, hot spots and skin rashes The Welsh Springer Spaniel developed in Wales, which is located on a peninsula of Great Britain. This breed is a direct descendant of the red and white dogs that the Gauls brought to Wales in pre-Roman times. In Wales they were isolated from the rest of the world and bred pure for centuries. Wales has been described as a highland country of old hard rocks. Yet this country, which is only 150 miles long, has three very distinct climates. The Welsh Springer Spaniel comes from the higher elevations of Wales (2700 to 3500 ft.) in the Brecknock area. This specific area of Wales has a great deal of temperature flux. It was this environment that gave this breed a weather resistant coat that is "self cleaning". It was also this environment that gave this breed its unique nutritional requirements. Only a limited variety of crops (rye, barley, wheat, and potato) could grow in the rocky soil of this breed's native environment. Any meats of the area were from the small herds of cattle or sheep and domesticated poultry, or wild fowl. For the Welsh Springer Spaniel I recommend foods that blend poultry, mutton, and beef meats with corn, wheat, and potato. However, I also recommend that you avoid feeding any ocean fish, white rice, avocado, or soy bean product to this breed. 195

WELSH TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - average 20 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - average 15 inches Coat: short and wiry in texture, black & tan or grizzle & tan in color Common Ailments: skin rashes, liver failure, kidney problems The Welsh Terrier, a true Terrier in every sense, is a direct descendant of the old English Black and Tan Terrier. It was first discovered in the early 18th century in the country of Wales. This breed of Terrier developed along the Welsh coast to hunt the otter, fox, and badger that inhabited the rookeries of this north Atlantic land. They are very similar in appearance to the Airedale Terrier, from Yorkshire County England, except for their body size. This similarity has led to the speculation that this breed and the Airedale may be related. However, there are records dating from 1737 that show the Welsh Terrier to be bred out of the old English Black and Tan and bred pure since then. If there is a relationship between the Airedale Terrier and the Welsh Terrier, it is far enough removed so that we can identify each one for the individual that it is. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from the coast of Wales and included the otter, badger, fox, fish, poultry, mutton, cabbage, and potato. These foods are the dietary staples for both the humans and the dogs in this area. For the Welsh Terrier I recommend foods that are a blend of fish, mutton, poultry, corn wheat, and potatoes. I also recommend you avoid feeding any horse meat, avocado, citrus fruit, or white rice to this breed. 196

WEST HIGHLAND WHITE TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - 15 to 18 lbs. Height Standards: m - 11 inches, f - 10 inches Coat: double, hard textured, straight and always white in color Common Ailments: coat pigmentation, kidney and liver failure The West Highland White Terrier comes from the Western Highlands of Scotland and they are white in color. This area is described as hard rock formations bisected by valleys known as "glens" or "straths." The highlands are in the shadow of the Grampian Mountains. Though this land is not good for agricultural crops, it is inhabited by many crofts (small farms), which raise sheep able to survive by grazing amongst the rocks. Also living amongst the rocks are many vermin, such as the fox, rabbit, and rodents. These vermin can ruin the limited crops grown in this area. Therefore, the farmers from this area developed a breed of dog that would both help control the vermin population and save their crops. This special breed is today's Westie. Native food supplies for this breed would have been the crofts' mutton and poultry stock, with potatoes and a limited amount of barley and rye. The dogs also would have eaten the vermin they hunted. For the West Highland White Terrier I recommend foods that provide meat protein from poultry and lamb, the carbohydrates from potato, barley, and wheat, and the fats from their poultry meat source. I also recommend you avoid feeding a commercial food that contains soy, white rice, yellow corn, beef, or horse meat to this breed. 197

WHIPPET

Weight Standards: m/f - average 25 lbs. Height Standards: m - 19 to 22 inches, f - 18 to 21 inches Coat: short and sleek, may be any color or color combination Common Ailments: monorchidism, hot spots and skin rash The Whippet developed in Great Britain but originated in Italy or Northern Africa. Roman legions brought this breed to Great Britain when they invaded in 49 A.D.. The Whippet is the breed example I use when asked how long it would take a dog to change its nutritional requirements when exposed to different foods. My answer is that it would take as long as it would for a dog's coat to adapt to a new climate. After twenty-one centuries, the Whippet still has a coat best suited for the warm and dry environment of its origins and not the heavier double coat found on breeds originating in the colder climate of the British Islands. Likewise, they still retain the nutritional requirements they developed in their native environment. Fortunately for the Whippet the rabbit was the main food supply in both their native area of the world and in their new homeland. Native food supplies for this breed would have been rabbits, domesticated poultry, mutton, goat, and wheat or corn. For the Whippet I recommend foods that are a blend of lamb, poultry, wheat, and corn. The addition of a linseed oil coat conditioner to this blend will provide this breed with a good balance of the fatty acids its skin and coat require. However, you should avoid feeding a soy oil coat conditioner to this breed as well as any soy bean meal in its food. Other food sources to avoid feeding a Whippet include horse meat, beef, or ocean fish. 198

WIREHAIRED POINTING GRIFFON

Weight Standards: m - average 60 lbs., f - average 50 lbs. Height Standards: m - 21.5 to 23.5 inches, f - 19.5 to 21.5 inches Coat: double, short, wiry textured, chestnut or gray & chestnut mix Common Ailments: dysplasia, liver and kidney problems, hot spots The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon originated in Holland and then developed further in France. Holland, now known as The Kingdom of the Netherlands, is a small European coastal country, north of France and east of Germany. Its highest elevation is 1000 feet and its lowest elevation is 20 feet below sea level. Holland's extremely fertile land and extremely wet climate produced a breed of dog that has one of the most unique coat fibers found in the canine family. This breed's coat, though relatively short, insulates the dog's body better than many fine textured long double coats found in the Nordic Spitz breeds. Yet this coat requires stripping and the texture is like that found in many terrier breeds from other climates. This coat, found only on the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, is one way this breed is different from other breeds of canines. The differences among this breed and others also extend to its nutritional requirements. Native food supplies found in their original coastal and lowland environment would have been oats, potato, rye, sugar beets, and wheat. Meats were from domesticated poultry, dairy cattle, and ocean fish of the North Sea. For the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon I recommend foods that contain ocean fish, poultry, and dairy products blended with potato, oats, and sugar beet. I also recommend that you avoid feeding yellow corn, avocado, soy bean meal, or horse meat to this breed. 199

XOLOITZCUINTLI

Weight Standards: m/f - Standard; average 50 lbs., Toy; average 30 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - Standard; 13 to 22 inches, Toy; under 13 inches Coat: a hairless breed of dog, only a tuft of hair on head and tip of tail Common Ailments: depigmentation, albinism, cryptorchidism, and monorchidism

The Xoloitzcuintli (pronounced: show - low - eats - queen - tlee) developed in Western Mexico. Historians trace this breed of dog to the Colima culture between 900 and 300 A.D. The Colima people kept the Xoloitzcuintli as a representative of their god Xolotl. It had the duty of guiding the souls of the dead to their unearthly destinations. The Xolo has many unique features when compared to other breeds of the canine family. They are hairless and their skin will sunburn. They have an abnormally high body temperature due to a metabolic rate different from any other animal. Another interesting feature is the absence of the pre-molar teeth. All of these unique physical features make this animal a one of a kind breed of dog. Native food supplies for this breed would have been from the western mountains of Mexico, located near the equator. This is a very hot and humid area where the native meats (even the wild boar) are very low in body fats and the crops consist of citrus fruits like the mango and papaya. For the Xolo I cannot recommend any of the commercial food blends. I do recommend that you study the nutrients of their immediate area before you attempt to take one of these dogs home with you. The Mexican government has declared it illegal to take one out of Mexico. Try to meet dietary needs by providing native nutrients to any "exported" member of this breed. 200

YORKSHIRE TERRIER

Weight Standards: m/f - under 7 lbs. Height Standards: m/f - under 7.5 inches Coat: double, silky long straight top coat, steel blue with tan Common Ailments: slipped stifle, enclampsia (common when whelping) The Yorkshire Terrier developed near the township of Yorkshire, England, on the British Islands. Prior to their becoming house pets, they were used as ratters in the coal mines and mills of the area. During this time the average Yorkshire Terrier weighed around 15 pounds, (about twice the body weight of today's Yorkie). Today's small Yorkie became the most popular toy breed in England after they were selectively bred down in size and made into fashionable house pets. The Yorkshire Terrier is one of the "slowest" of the toy breeds when it comes to the development of its skeletal structure. Thus it requires more of the nutrients found in puppy formulas for a longer period of time than the other toy breeds. When first born, they are normally a solid black color and do not become steel blue and tan in color until they reach about one year of age. This change in coat color can be used as a "gauge" for changing the dog's puppy formula to adult dog food. Native food supplies for this breed would have been rodents, a dairy cattle form of beef, potato, sugar beet, rye, and barley. For the Yorkshire Terrier I recommend foods that are a blend of horse and beef meats, sugar beet, potato, wheat, and barley. I also suggest you avoid feeding a Yorkie any red fish, such as salmon, yellow corn, or soy. 201

William D. Cusick
& two friends
This is Mr. Cusick's second book. His first book about the different dog breeds and their very different nutritional requirements was, CANINE NUTRITION AND CHOOSING THE BEST FOOD FOR YOUR BREED OF DOG, published in 1990. Mr. Cusick first became interested in the nutritional variations between the different breeds of dogs in 1968. At that time he was the owner of a major West Coast vitamin manufacturing company producing an all breed dog food supplement that Saint Bernards thrived on but which caused nutritional distress when fed to Dalmatians. His curiousness about the reactions that these two breeds of dogs had to the one food product led him on a twenty year search to identify the nutritional morphologies for most members of the species: canine. After his research proved why a food “good for one breed can be harmful to a different breed” Mr. Cusick felt compelled to educate all dog owners about his discoveries. This book is only one way he is trying to get that message out. He has also taken his crusade on-line with an Internet web site titled “William D. Cusick / The Animal Advocate.” His web site can be found through the various Internet search engines so that people can contact him with any questions they may have about breed specific nutrition and feeding their pets - CORRECTLY.

The Scientific Community Reviewed The Research
and stated: “What emerges from the data developed by Cusick is a new way of looking at the nutritional needs of sub-species.” Dalton Scott, “Dogs and Nutrition,” BIOLOGY DIGEST Volume 13, (Issue 9, May 1987) pp11-17

Then this book was reviewed by people like yourself
A Pet Owner: “The fact that dogs are genetically different is obvious. As Mr. Cusick points out in this book, THEIR GENETIC DIFFERENCES INCLUDE THEIR NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS. When I go to the pet store to buy food for my dogs, cats, birds and fish, they have food made for the different types of birds and fish but not for dogs and cats. Now I know why and what to do about it.” G. Moran A Breeder: “In 1985 I met Mr. Cusick. Not being happy with the food I was feeding at the time, I asked for and received the best advice I've ever had on nutrition! In Maltese, coat is very important and to get the coat you have to feed the proper food. I highly recommend this book to all breeders, veterinarians and pet owners.” Peggy L. Wanner / Kandu Maltese A Dog Show Judge: “For anyone having suffered through his dog displaying many of the signs of improper feeding this book is a treasure chest. Most of us do not realize that dogs' nutritional needs are not like men's socks "one size fits all." It has only been in recent times that dog food companies have prepared special formulas for age groupings. Now William Cusick comes along and knocks many of our pet theories, and perhaps those of the various dog food companies into a cocked hat. The book is interesting reading and zeroes in on your breed. I would advise you to read it thoroughly and ponder the significance of the research done for this enlightening book. It belongs in your library.” Dr. Alvin Grossman A Veterinarian: “This book will make an excellent addition to the textbook library at my clinic. It has a wealth of information. I will use it as a reference source for nutritional and medical cases. Any person serious about breeding or owning dogs will want this book." Richard Thoresen, D. V. M.

House training a dog
House training is an example of the most vital parts of training any dog to be a valued
part of the family. As with lots of other facets of dog coaching, the only way to house
train a dog is to use the dog’s own nature to your benefit.

In addition, dogs are fantastic at developing habits per where they like to urinate and
defecate. Step one in house training your dog is to put up your coaching area. A little,
confined space like a lavatory, or part of a kitchen or garage, works best as a coaching
area.

Crate coaching is superb for puppies and little dogs, but several bigger dogs find a crate
too confining. It’s important for the owner to spend as much time in the coaching area
with their dog as possible.

It’s important for the owner to play with the dog in the coaching area, and to let the dog
eat and sleep in that area.

After the dog has gotten used to sleeping in the bed, the owner can move it round the
house, relocating it from room to room. When you’re not with your dog, the dog should
be confined to the coaching area.

The second part of house training your dog is to put up the toilet area for the dog. It’s
important for the dog to have access to this place each time he wants to eliminate. A set
feeding schedule makes the house coaching process a lot simpler for both the owner and
the dog. Feeding the dog on regularly will also make a regular schedule for the dog’s
toilet habits.

When you know when your dog is probably going to need to do its business, it is going to
be easy to steer the dog to the established toilet area. That is because if the dog is not able
to carry it, she might be made to eliminate in the coaching area. This process should be
done slowly, beginning with one room and slowly expanding to the remainder of the
house. The area should only be extended when you are sure of the dog’s capability to
control its bladder and guts. When it isn’t feasible to control the dog, place it back in the
first coaching area. Then, after the dog has accepted the room as an extension of the first
coaching area, the area can be extended.

If this process is too lengthy for your requirements, it can be speeded up, but it’s
important to proceed carefully. It is better to take your time up front than to retrain a dog
later.

Reward training your dog
It is likely that reward coaching for dogs has been around so long as there have been dogs
to coach. However, what is known as reward coaching today has only enjoyed is
noteworthy recognition for the past ten or fifteen years. However, the best path to
coaching any individual dog is usually a mixture of leash / collar coaching and reward
coaching. In addition, a coaching strategy that works completely for one dog might be
fully unfit for another, and vice versa. Most reward training uses some variety of food
reward, or a reward that is related to getting food. Reward coaching is employed in all
forms of dog training, including police work and army applications. Most smell
detection, tracking and police dogs are trained using some type of reward coaching.

Reward coaching is also a particularly acceptable way to coach a lot of basic obedience
commands. Reward coaching frequently incorporates the employment of a lure to get the
dog into the position desired by the coach.

The attraction is used to get the dog to perform the specified behavior on their own and of
his or her very own free will.

It makes for a large amount of sense to get the dog to perform the desired behavior
without any physical intervention on the part of the handler. Getting the dog to perform a
behavior without being touched is vital. After the dog has performed the required
behavior, it is given a reward, also called a positive reinforcement.

Treats are typically used as reinforcers, but praise,eg “good dog” or a pat on the head, can
also be effective rewards.

Many people when dog training make the error of only coaching the dog within the house
or back yard, and only when the handler is there. It’s also vital to coach the dog to
concentrate on the handler at all times. Having the eye of the dog means having control
of the dog. Reward coaching is terribly effective at getting the status and the eye of the
dog when used correctly.

What is the Green Bean Dog Diet?
For some time now people have playing around with the idea of the green bean diet for
dogs. You may have already know about this and are considered trying it. Let’s take a
look at the green bean dog diet and discuss some of the problems and advantages of it.

If you decide to feed your dog the green bean diet, you should know that you can not
only feed your dog green beans. By only giving your dog this green vegetable diet would
not be the right healthy decision for your dog’s diet. Pet owners should find the balance
between dog food and green beans that will produce the desired results.

The green bean dog diet is standard kibble for your pet mixed with a amount of green
beans. These green beans are a healthy way to keep your dog full between meals. Adding
some green beans to the food at meal times will help your dog’s diet and keep your dog
feeling full and happy between meals.

Should all dogs be eating the green bean diet? No not all dog’s should have green beans
added to their meals. The green bean dog diet is ideal for dogs who should lose weight.
Many pet owners continue to use the green bean dog diet to help keep a healthy weight
for their pet, This is after the initial weight loss.

It is not often that your dog will turn there nose up at the green beans. Dogs feel fuller
and will have more of a happy attitude towards you. Also a increase in health and vitality.

One down side to think about when you decide to change your dog’s diet over to the
green bean diet, is the larger amount of fiber your dog will consume. Some dog’s systems
can react to this, so you will need to monitor your pet’s outputs. Begin adding the green
beans a little at a time and gradually increase the amount. Some pet owners find it helps
to only add the green beans to there dog’s diet at one meal time during the day, this is
done keep there dog’s potty schedule in order.
If you do decide to use the green bean dog diet as your dog’s diet, then there are a few
tips to keep in mind. You will need to purchase a re sealable lid to cover the open can of
green beans, this is for easier storage in between meals. You should measure the amount
of green beans in your dog’s diet just the same as you would measure kibble or treats that
you give your dog.

When ever possible you should purchase your canned green beans with no added salt.
This is a healthy option for your dog’s diet.

The green bean dog diet has many advantages. But you will need to monitor your dog’s
intake of them to help prevent unforeseeable outputs. The green bean dog diet will help to
lose and maintain weight while keeping your pet healthy and happy.

Your Garden and Your Dog!
Summer is here all year around for some people. For a lot of people that means that they
can enjoy the two greatest loves in their life; their dog and their garden.

Unfortunately, the two do not always get along. The garden starts to grow. Visions of
flowers, herbs and vegetables are in your head. Your dog also has visions…visions of
playing in the green grass, in the shade of the batch of lilies that are growing in the
corner. I know my black lab, Benny, loved to lie in the midst of the lilies and hide. He
would stretch out like a torpedo. Heck one day I couldn’t find him at all, I thought he
was lost.

But, along with all those wonderful visions comes danger for your dog. So, here are a
few tips and tricks for you.

- Remember, Bored dogs get into trouble. A dog needs a walk, no matter how big your
property. A dog needs a walk, that steady, fast forward walk.
- Teach your dog a cue; one sentence that means “get out of the garden”. I did that with
my two, and it works! It means you have to spend a little extra attention on your dog at
the beginning. But it works. By the way, this is also good if you take your dog visiting.
It means your dog will learn to respect all gardens.

- There are pet friendly “pet repellents” available. Please, make sure that they are safe. A
beautiful garden is not worth the life of your pet.

- At the beginning of the season, if you have a place you don’t want your dog to go, put
down some bristled twigs; it will reinforce the “get out of the garden” phrase you will say
when your dog goes to that spot.

And mostly, please be aware for the Safety of your pets.

- Try to chose other than chemicals for lawn and garden care. Even organic garden
products can be dangerous to your pets. If you have a need to use them, keep your pets
away, usually for 24 hours.

- A lot of the garden fertilizers are made of “animal bone meal” which is very attractive to
dogs. Please use an alternative. Become aware of what you use around your dog.
Especially if you have a new dog or puppy.

- Also, certain plants are poisonous to dogs.

Become aware of what could hurt your pet, and have a great summer!

Using a head collar for dog training
The head collar has become an increasingly well-liked dog training tool during the past 2
years. The advantage of this design is that even if the dog is somehow in a position to
squirm out of the muzzle, it remains wearing a collar. This safety feature is vital,
particularly during coaching outside or in novel scenarios. Coaching a dog with a head
collar has some advantages over coaching with a conventional or coaching collar. For one
thing, head collars are typically simpler to use for beginning dog trainers than are
coaching collars. Head collars are also quite successful at stopping dogs from pulling, or
controlling and retraining dogs that have a tendency to pull.

Head collars can be fantastic for controlling dogs that are really robust, or for working
with a dog in an area that contains plenty of distractions. For example, head collars are
superb for when your dog is on and expedition, or in an area where there’ll be other dogs
and other distractions. Even though a head collar could be a great tool, it shouldn’t be
used as a replacement for effective dog coaching. Although head collars have plenty of
advantages , they have some distinct drawbacks too.

If your dog exhibits this behavior, the best technique is to keep it moving until it learns to
accept the collar.

A good alternative is to have the dog sit by pulling up on the dog’s head. Another
drawback of the head collar is the reaction that many people have to it. Many of us think
that a head collar is a muzzle, and react to the dog as if it may bite. Whilst this isn’t
always a flaw of the head collar, many of us do find it worrying. To conclude, coaching
with a head collar is very similar to training with a coaching collar or any other
equipment. The eventual goal of dog training with a head collar should be to have the dog
behave as well with a regular collar as it does with the specialized head collar.

Got Fleas? 7 Easy Ways to Get Rid of Them
Fleas are pesky critters that can transmit a variety of diseases and illnesses and make life
miserable for your pet as well. Getting rid of these pests is essential for a healthy, happy
home for all of its two-legged and four-legged inhabitants. Here are seven easy ways to
prevent and control the flea population around your house.

Prevention is Key

The best method in the fight against fleas is preventing an infestation in the first place.
Since they thrive in heat and humidity, be sure to check your pet frequently during the
hotter months as well as in the fall or autumn. Another critical preventative measure is
keeping your yard trimmed and free of weeds and to keep the foliage pruned as much as
possible. It’s also wise to wash the pet’s bedding in very hot, soapy water on a weekly
basis as this is the most likely site for flea eggs and larvae.

Keep an Eye on Your Pet

It should go without saying that it’s necessary to watch your pet for commons signs and
symptoms of a flea infestation. Keep an eye out for excessive biting and scratching,
particularly around the tail and lower back areas. Watch for raw patches of skin where
your dog or cat may have been scratching at fleas for some time. Another bit of evidence
is “flea debris,” specks of dried blood that are black in color.

Ask for a Professional

Consult with your veterinarian for their thoughts on flea control. They can recommend a
few treatment options for you to decide which would be best for your particular situation.

Flea Collars and Powders

If you have caught the problem relatively early, it may be possible to eliminate fleas by
using flea collars and powders. There are several brands and types to choose from, and
many contain a special comb with fine teeth that is designed to remove fleas from fur.

Flea Baths

It’s helpful to bathe your pet frequently using a specially formulated soap or treatment.
It’s necessary to take into consideration the type of fur or coat your pet has when bathing.
This is particularly true for dogs as some breeds have essential oils that shouldn’t be
washed away with soap and water more than once or twice a year. If bathing in a flea
bath isn’t an option for your pet, consult your vet for other alternatives.

Monthly Medication
There are pills available for your pet to take on a monthly basis that will prevent fleas
from reproducing, but they do not kill the ones that have already reached adulthood.
There are also multi-purpose medications and products available that are designed to
prevent fleas from reproducing as well as controlling heartworm, hookworms,
whipworms and roundworms.

An Unconventional Method

This simple home remedy is touted by many as a sure cure for a house infested with fleas.
At nighttime, simply fill a few bowls of plain water and place them underneath a lit
flashlight. It is said that the fleas will be attracted to the light, jump into the water and
drown.

puppies and dogs. They’re leather dog collars, once the average dog gear and now a
luxury item. Is a leather dog collars right for your dog?

Benefits

Some of the advantages of using leather dog collars are that they are long lasting
provided you take care of them properly. Although they cost more initially than other
collars, they can sometimes last longer than the life of your dog. Some owners of dogs
who get good and muddy like to use leather dog collars and leashes than of other
materials because it is so durable.

Another advantage is that leather always goes with your dog’s fur, whether it is brown
leather or black leather. Leather has a timeless look and a great smell, if you take care of
the leather correctly. There are now a wide variety of leather dog collars in different
patterns, colors, with rhinestones or other additions. There are even big name designers of
people fashions who are getting into pet couture.

Disadvantages

The main disadvantage of leather dog collars is that it’s made out of very tasty animal
hide. At least, your dog thinks it’s tasty. You can’t explain to your dog that it’s not
acceptable to chew on the $100 rolled leather dog collar but it is preferrable to chew on
rawhide treats. They are made of nearly the same stuff. Dogs will chew on leather, but
with patience and persistence, they can be trained not to.

Other disadvantages are having to clean and condition the leather dog collar and leash.
You dont have these worries with nylon or rayon collars and leashes. You can throw them
in the bath along with the dog. But prolonged exposure to soaking water will destroy
leather. You need to get special soaps and conditioners for them. You might need to have
the leather collars worn only on special occasions.

If you are a vegetarian or vegan, than you are already trying to cut out all animal-based
products from your life. The thought of killing cows for dog collars might not sit well on
your conscious. But there are elegant fake leather dog collars that are just about as tough
as leather on the market. As an added bonus, they don’t have the strong smell that attracts
dogs looking for a quick treat.

Are you concerned about the health of your dog? I compiled a list of 10 foods and
ingredients which you should not feed your dog.

1. You should not give chocolate to your puppy because it contains the alkaloid
theobromine, caffeine which is toxic to dogs.

2.. Dog’s digestive system can not digest the protein and sugar in dairy products. Hence
you should not feed dairy products like milk, cream, butter, cheese, cottage cheese,
yogurt, whey, sour cream, kefir, casein, and ice cream.

3. Dogs are very sensitive to oils so always avoid the same. Even you should be extra
careful before you apply oil to dog for aromatherapy or massage.

4. There is a recent report regarding toxicity due to grape and raisin ingestion so avoid
them.

5. Some houseplants are toxic so you should avoid houseplants till you train your dog
properly on chewing. If you like, you can provide a pot of fresh wheatgrass for safe
nibbling.

6. You should avoid onions and garlic because they might irritate the gastrointestinal
system.

7. Salmon poisoning is an infectious disease caused by a rickettsia that uses a parasitic
fluke on salmon as a host. It can cause serious illness and death.

reactions, bloating, digestive and urinary problems.

Top Tips For Successful Dog Behavior Training
Dog behavior training for chewing is an issue you will need to address early on in your
relationship

Dogs carry out destructive chewing for three main reasons, they are simply bored, they
find it pleasurable to do so, or they find it helps get them through emotional times. The
nearest human equivalent for which might be to consume a bar of chocolate!

Anything that gets in the way of this chewing normally ends up in poor state. Of course
your dog has many sharp teeth which will get through many household items.

Whatever you do never let your dog chew anything of yours, just being allowed one item
can be interpreted by your dog as there being everything up for grabs.

How To Avoid Your Possessions Being Destroyed

The first tip for dog behavior training is to not place valuable objects in the way of
temptation. If you have had a baby then you know all about making your house safe of
loose items. Why let providence intervene.

In addition, when hiding things be aware of just how agile your dog is. The distance she
can reach when on her hind legs?

Consider that common targets in the home include books, eyewear, clothing, shoes,
garbage, and small appliances like cameras, cell phones, and remote controls.

Of course food is the one thing that needs to be stored securely. A sensible thing to do
with food is to always make sure it is stored either in high cupboards or locked away in
airtight containers.

The phrase prevention is better than cure applies to dog behaviour training too, if your
dog is not given the opportunity to discover the delights of chewing a forbidden item then
it is a lot easier for her to learn your house rules.

Allowing your dog to carry on some old habits can seriously undermine your training
efforts. Once she has the taste do not be surprised to find shoes you care about being
treated to the same destructive chewing.

Getting some doggy toys is a good way of helping your dog understand that those are
hers to play with, not any of your own stuff. Take a look around your local pet store for
tough items such as rubber bones and balls etc. Buy a few and rotate their use as a way to
keep your dog behavior training interesting.
Some final advice on dog behavior, when you catch your dog chewing something
inappropriate be sure to interrupt her immediately and provide a suitable alternative and
give lavish praise when this is accepted as a way of reinforcing good behavior.

Could That Labrador Golden Retriever Puppy Be A
Future Life Saver?
Lots of people have known for a long time that certain crossbreeds of dogs are an
improvement on each of the original breeds. The trick is finding the best crossable
breeds. Lots of these crossbreeds end up becoming considered pure breeds themselves.
One of the most successful crossbreeds in dogs is seen in the Labrador/Golden Retriever
puppy, known also as Golden Labrador Retrievers. As puppies they begin to show the
best traits of their parents breeds.

The Perfect Personality?

Both Labrador and Golden Retrievers are dogs that really like people and are eager to
please. Note that not every one is alike, and bad training will always make for a bad,
fearful dog (regardless of breed), but overall, a Labrador/Golden Retriever puppy is a
born people lover. They are fascinated by people and seem to easily bond with them.
They also have a lot of strength and energy, which comes in good for service and search
and rescue dogs.
Great Dogs For Helping the Blind

Golden Labrador Retrievers are hailed as the best seeing eye dogs by experts that train
seeing eye dogs in England. There is an extensive breeding program run in England by
Guide Dogs to raise dogs to be seeing eye dogs. A Labrador/Golden Retriever puppy is
first tested at about eight weeks of age to see what his personality is like.

A seeing eye dog’s training is never really over. Often, puppies will fail training and be
put up for adoption. To take a Labrador/Golden Retriever puppy and turn out a
dependable life-saver costs an average of $70,000. They work until old age or illness
forces them to retire, then they are placed in care homes for the remainder of their lives.

Other Facts

Although many online Labrador information web sites will say that a Golden Labrador is
always yellow, this is not true. Occasionally a dark puppy will be born. American Canine
Hybrid Club is where you can register your Labrador Golden Retriever puppy.

Every day, a newborn Golden / Labrador Retriever puppy makes that first step to being a
drug sniffing dog, cancer sniffing dog, service dog or a search and rescue dog. They all
can rescue us from ourselves and our selfishness and help give our souls back to us.

5 Great Tips On Building A Dog House
Over 50% of the population allows their dog to stay indoors and sleep on the couch or in
their owner’s bed. For those of you who are interested in building a dog house for you
beloved pet here are some simple rules to follow when considering what type of shelter
you want to provide.

1. You should begin your dog house building process by making sure the house is big
enough to accommodate your animal’s potential adult size. Humans enjoy having about 2
feet of air above us in a room in order to live without feeling claustrophobic. Your dog
will probably also enjoy having that much room. The comfort zone for both humans and
dogs is about 1/3 of their standing height. To figure out how much room the dog will
need get out a tape measure and measure your dog. Measure him standing straight up,
sitting on his haunches and above all measure the full dimension of the dog when he is
the most comfortable, relaxed and stretched out position he can get into. Your dog should
be able to look out the front entrance while both standing up and sitting. So the dog will
not have to significantly lover his front shoulders or scrape his belly make sure that
entrance is high enough. Stand over the dog and measure the width of the widest point of
the animal’s shoulders.

2. Remember to raise the dog house several inches from the ground to allow air and water
to flow underneath. To dissuade pests from invading the dog house and taking your dogs
health into consideration remember how important ventilation is. Put in a few nickel-
sized holes in the walls under the eaves. Install a wind block inside the house so the dog
can use the heat of its own body to warm up the area if it is really cold or windy outside.
Consider adding a partial wall which will allow your dog to escape the bad weather. Your
animal can choose to just sleep in the entry room or go around the inner archway maze
wall into the inner sanctum. Your beloved pet would probably love having a pillow or
some sort of bedding to sleep on.

3. To avoid rain coming into the dog house make the floor just a bit slanted toward the
doorway and build the roof a little bit slanted, as well. Make sure the house is well
insulated but you should not paint the inside.

4. In the United States most storms come from the south and west so make sure the dog
house faces a different direction. Most dog house plans suggest that the dog house door
faces east. The cold air will not be able to whip through the entryway then.

5. It is suggested that you put hinges on the roof of the dog house. This makes it easier
for you to clean out your dog’s home. You should clean the dog’s house as often as you
give your dog a bath.
If your dog lives outside then he deserves to have a comfortable place to sleep and get out
of harsh weather. Hopefully these easy tips on building a dog house will help you get
started.

4 to 8 Dog Agility Jumps Makes Ideal Training
We are often asked, “How many jumps should I start with?” You can never have too
many single jumps to practice agility. A good starting place is four jumps. This is the
absolute minimum number of jumps that we recommend.

You can teach a variety of skills, drills, and exercises with four jumps. Four jumps will
allow you to work on a short jump chute or jump grid. You can setup a “box” with your
jumps and practice handling, collection, and 270 degree jumps. You can teach your dog
jumping left and right. You can be outside the box and send your dog or you can handle
from the inside of the box. Your jumps can be setup in a horizontal line, so that you can
practice serpentines and threadles.

Go the next step and get eight jumps. Now you can setup two boxes with one
introductory jump. You’ve now multiplied your drills that you can practice with your
dog. Your jump grids can be of recommended size and quantity of jumps. You can also
setup your jumps in a circle with the jump bars perpendicular to the circle or on the
circumference of the circle. This pattern also enables you to train a variety of skills.
Your next consideration is a double jump and a triple jump. You could set two or three
single jumps together to make your expanded jump, but having double and triple jump in
your course work is really valuable to practice. We’ve seen many dogs run a clean course
and the last obstacle is a triple and the dog is not prepared for it, and bang, down comes
the bar.

You can really be ahead of the pack and have two sets of eight jumps. This is the
ultimate in training because you can keep a jump grip up at all times that is separate from
your course work, and have eight single jumps to have for course work. And when you
include your double and triple, you can really practice all the jumping skills and drills
necessary to get you those “Qs”.

3 Important Things To Remember When Training Your
Puppy
There are as many ways to raise a puppy as there are to raising a child. In fact, one way
per family in general! But most of us agree that when it comes to children, certain things
are universal and undisputed. Here are three things that a lot of people just do not think of
when it comes to raising their dogs, however. How many times have we heard, “My dog
just won’t listen to me”, or “He just won’t behave!”

1. Dogs do not understand English until we teach them.

The thing we all love about puppies the most is the way they live for us, the way they
focus all they have on us, the way our lives become theirs. In the beginning, they study us
to learn our body language, our facial expressions and our language. Until we teach them
the English language, it’s all they have. If we say, “Wanna go out?” one day, “Have to go
potty?” the next day, and, “Hafta pee?” the third day, if they DO figure out what we want,
it is because we have picked up the leash and moved toward the door with a happy face!
If you want to speed up his training by three-fold, teach him YOUR language. Pick a
command for EACH behavior and stick with it. Tell all in your family to use the same
words and commands, and your puppy will amaze you at how much faster he learns.

2. A young puppy’s metabolism is racing along faster than we think.
The younger your puppy is, the faster he is growing, the more food and water he needs to
fuel his metabolism, and the more often he has to go potty. Do not punish your puppy
when he makes a house-breaking mistake. These are YOUR fault. Your puppy’s age in
weeks and his breed size determine how often he must go out. Once an hour is not too
often for a large 6-week old puppy, especially if it is summertime. Dogs love the exciting
smells outdoors, so there is no excuse to not have him housebroken by 7-8 weeks of age.
Right after a nap, after he eats and after grooming are the key times, and he will signal
you. If he is happily chewing a toy and gets up suddenly with his nose to the floor, move
quickly! And every time he goes potty outside, praise him to high heaven! “What a good
BOYY!”, “GOOD go potty!” and the like. Dogs love our happy faces, and they will do
anything to get it.

3. Dogs live for our facial expressions and body language.

Because of this, the worst punishment you ever need to give your dog is a scowl and to
turn away from him. You can see his tail fall down and his face get so sad. He will learn
the lesson, I guarantee it. But his attention span is only 3-5 minutes, so do not scorn him
any longer. Love him up and give him your happy face again. Physical punishment is
never necessary. Use consistent commands and loving praise and he will know what you
want of him before you know. He will become a master of your body language and facial
expressions in no time at all.

Naturally there are many aspects of training your puppy well. Loving kindness works just
as well for puppies as it does with children, creating a happy, well-adjusted and obedient
dog for life. These three important tips, used consistently with confidence, will start him
well on his way.

3 easy to teach dog tricks
To teach your dog tricks even easy ones you need to have some small reward treats, be in
a quiet suitable place and keep the training sessions to 10 - 15 minutes or your dog will
start to get board, remember when he gets something right lots of praise and a reward
treat, just be careful not to get him over excited or he will loose concentration.

Getting your dog to give you his paw, first get your dog to sit, then as you say the word
‘paw’ take your dogs paw in your hand, give the dog a treat, repeat this, after a few times
do not take his paw so quickly, say the word, count to one then take it, you should notice
he is bringing his paw up as you say the word if he does not go back to saying it at the
same time, do it a few more times then slow your response again. After 2 or 3 sessions
most dogs pick this one up quite happily.

The high five, like a lot of tricks the high five is a progression of an earlier trick, in this
cast the paw trick. Hold a treat in your fingers and raise your hand slightly higher than
you would for the paw trick. You dog will think you want to do the paw trick and will
reach for the treat with his paw as we taught him earlier, as he reaches up you say “high
five” and give him the treat. Once your dog has mastered the paw trick this one should be
very easy to learn and with just a few sessions he will be doing it on hand signal rather
than voice control.

Getting your dog to jump through a hoop, before you start this one I would just like to
ask you to be a little sensible and not hold the hoop too high as you do not want your dog
to heart himself while doing the trick. Sit your dog on one side of a hoola hoop, get the
dogs attention on your hand on the other side of the hoop take a treat in your hand and
give the dog the command to release him from the sit, at first he may attempt to go
around or under the hoop, if this happens start again, your dog wants the treat and will
soon learn that going around or under does not get it so he will soon start going through
it, when he does say hoopla and give him the treat. He will soon be jumping through the
hoop on the command of hoopla. When I started doing this trick I had a medium sized
dog (a Labrador) so I started with the hoop 6 inches from the ground and slowly raised it
to waist height, if you have a smaller dog you might want to start with the hoop touching
the ground so the dog just goes through the hoop and then slowly raise it as he gets used
to the trick.

Tips for training your puppies
All of us dream of parenting the perfect dog, a pup that is a CGC or canine good citizen
and is well behaved and dependable at all times. Well dreams do come true if the training
is done with care and dedication. Remember pups learn from day one and need to be
taught what is right, what is wrong, and proper socialization.

Pups are like children, they need constant supervision and training. Training a pup need
not be an ordeal all you need to keep in mind are a few simple rules:

• Until your pup learns you need to keep an eye on him at all times. When you cannot
then you must crate him. Create a schedule for the pup this will help the pup settle down
quickly. The schedule must include things like hourly bath rooming visits, eating times,
rest periods, walks, play time, training, and so on. A pup that has a busy day has no time
to be bored and get into mischief.

• Teach the pup to respect you. Dogs live in packs and instinctively follow a leader. If
you establish your leadership in no uncertain terms then training will become easy as the
pup will obey you at all times and not challenge your authority.

• Use only positive training methods. Never shout at, hit, or punish a dog. It is not just
cruel but can lead to behavioral problems. Use of electric shocks, prong collars, sprays,
and so on could hurt the animal.

• Teach the pup “nothing in life is free.” This is a system that is widely acknowledged
as a useful training tool. If you practice this, the pup will learn that to get something like
love, a walk, or treat, he must behave well.

• Teach the meaning of “No,” from day one. Do not encourage behaviors like jumping,
mouthing, tug-o-war, barking, or running out of open gates and doors. Praise good
behavior and ignore or walk away when there is bad behavior. The pup will learn that if
he misbehaves he will loose his companion/playmate.

• To correct a behavior you must catch the pup in the act and startle him by rattling a
can of pebbles. Once you have done this make him correct his behavior and immediately
offer him a treat and praise. Pups do not recall what happened earlier so scolding him
after an event is of no use.

• Always call/use his name positively. Never say “Bad TOM,” or “No Tom,” this will
cause confusion and the pup will think that if you call his name then it is something bad.
The pup must associate his name with happy events like hugs, petting, walks, treats, and
such. If this happens he will come willingly when you call out his name.

• Create a training schedule that is short and sweet say 10 minutes thrice a day. Long
repetitive lessons can be boring and the pup will loose interest in learning. Make learning
fun and use trick training to teach commands like sit, down, come and so on.

• Bond with the pup and both of you will enjoy your lessons. The pup must look
forward to spending time with you and not avoid you by running away or hiding. Be sure
to socialize the pup early. Socialization is one of the most important lessons. The pup
must learn to be around other animals, people, sounds, vehicles, and other activities. So,
slowly introduce the pup when he is little to everyday activities and sounds. Take him to
the mall/ park, introduce him to children and other pets, and make him unafraid of the
vacuum and garden hose.

• Learn all about crate training, leash walking, house breaking, as well as food training.
These are kindergarten lessons that every pup must master. Know about all the
idiosyncrasies as well as peculiarities of the breed this will give you valuable insights on
how to successfully train the pup.

As a pet-parent you have many choices. You could choose to train the dog yourself or
register at a professional training school. Training a dog has many stages: kindergarten,
obedience training, doggy sports, showing and conformation, as well as other aspects like
therapy dogs, hearing dogs, and so on. What level you choose to train depends on you as
well as the learning abilities of your dog. As you know, different dog breeds like humans
have varied talents. Choose well and both you and your pup will have fun times together.

Guidelines To Choose A Healthy Dog Diet for Your Pet
When choosing a healthy dog diet it can often be difficult and confusing, that is if you let
it be. The packaging and marketing of the products you wish to purchase will often blur
your perception of it. Your dogs diet is the easiest and best way to keep your pet in good
health and happy for the many years you will have together. it is better for you to find a
diet that will provide all the essential nutrients that are needed for your pet to thrive rather
than merely survive.

So here are some basic guidelines for you to follow when you are selecting the food for
your dogs diet. you should know that every dog is different and what is the right diet for
your neighbors dog may not be exactly what your pet needs.

The first step should always be when deciding your dogs diet, is to talk to your vet. They
will always have your pets interest at heart, just like you. The vets recommendations will
help you make the right decision.

What you need to do is find a reputable brand of dog food to be the main ingredient of
your dogs diet. It is not impossible to come across a high-quality dog food that you have
never heard of or seen before, but a well known and manufacturer provides you with an
amount of safety and security about the decision to feed your dog a healthy diet.

Reputable and recognized dog food manufacturers take the time to research animal
nutrition. This allows your pet to benefit from the company’s research rather than going it
alone.

What you should do is select a dog food that is appropriate for your pets age. With a older
that is showing signs of aging, then it is best to consider a dog diet that is specially
formulated for senior dogs. On the other hand puppies have different nutritional needs
than adult dogs.

You will need to find a variety of food that meets your dogs needs. Even the breed and
size of your pet will make a difference in the type of diet you should feed it. Diets
formulated specifically for small dogs and large breeds are readily available. You will
want to keep this in mind when selecting your dog’s diet.

The activity level and weight are the other factors for you to consider when making the
decision of what to feed your dog. When you decide on a diet for your dog, pay attention
to the portion size. Obesity is a serious problem in pets. It can lead to hip trouble and take
years off your pets life.

Table scraps are definitely not a healthy diet. Your dogs diet should consist of a high-
quality food specially designed to meet your pets dietary needs.
Only supplement a high quality diet when recommended by your vet. If you give your pet
too many supplements in the dogs diet then this can lead to a poor of health.

Your dogs diet will fuel his health, so choose your dogs diet wisely. You need to select a
brand of food that is reputable and suited to your dog. When you find the right diet for
your pet it will promote good health and allow your dog to thrive for many years to come.

Curb Irritating Dog Barking Behavior
Barking is as natural to a dog as talking is as natural to a human being. Trying to
eliminate dog barking altogether would be like trying to stop someone to talk forever! It’s
impossible and it’s not exactly a nice thing to do. But we have to admit, excessive
barking (much like excessive talking) is totally irritating—not just to you but to your
family, your hot neighbor, the children at play, the mailman, and every one else who can
hear it.

Though barking shouldn’t be stopped—after all, it is very useful when your dog uses it
for the right reasons like warning you, warding off trespassers, or telling you something
of importance—it must be controlled. If you want to maintain peace in the neighborhood
and between your neighbors, controlling your dog’s barking habits is important.

Many people and dog owners don’t know much about curbing incessant dog barking
behavior.

A lot of dog owners would basically just run to an anti-barking collar. They seem to be
the most convenient solution. What’s so appealing about collars is that they can help the
owner supervise incessant barking while the owner isn’t around. Today, there are
basically three different types of anti-barking collars available in the market.

One is the sonar collar. Sonar collars are discreet things. It basically releases a high
frequency sound inaudible to humans and irritable to dogs whenever the dog would bark.
The idea is that they will associate the irritable sound as punishment to their incessant
barking.

The second one is the citronella collar. The citronella collar sprays a scent that dogs don’t
really like. When the dog barks, they spray so that, like the sonar collar, the dog would
find the scent as a punishment for their incessant barking. Although the device sounds
promising, anecdotal reports state that a lot of dogs have already found a way to get
around this collar.

One anecdotal report states that their dog would just keep on barking until the collar runs
out of citronella. Afterwards, he will go on barking the whole day without having to deal
with the citronella smell. Other dogs find other ways, like making a face (that probably
gets them to hold their breath somehow) when the collar sprays and then barking again.
The third variety is called the shock collar. This collar gets a lot of people iffy. It stops
dog barking with electric shock. The strength level of the electric current can even be
changed from 1 to 6; 6 being the highest and the one that stings the most.

Many people regard this collar as inhumane and don’t condone it. After all, no sane
person would do that to another person so why even think of doing it to their own pet? A
lot of people reasonably avoid the sonar collar.

Although they may all seem very practical, easy, and promising, collars are at most,
simply a supplementary solution to incessant dog barking.

Before running to anti-barking collars, find a solution first—find out why your dog barks
that way in the first place. If humans have psychologists, dogs have veterinarian
behaviorists. Their role is to generally observe a dog’s environment and circumstances to
figure out what exactly triggers their socially unacceptable behavior. And then based on
their findings, they give training solutions to eliminate the behavior problem.

Some reasons as to why a dog would bark are things like the lack of things to do (they
might have too much time in their paws with nothing to spend it with) or frustration
(perhaps they’re being bullied by another dog in the family or by the people around them)
to name two.

If you don’t know why your dog keeps barking, you can call a vet behaviorist to help you
out. A vet behaviorist will also teach you what to do. They might recommend you to get
an anti-barking collar but only to support training.

Barking dogs are just sometimes extremely bored with so much energy to waste. If you
think your dog might just be bored, then it’s time to spend time with him playing—take
him for walks, play catch with him, and let him socialize with other dogs. If you don’t
have time, then hire a dog walker or take it to a doggie day care. When left alone with
nothing to do, dogs feel bored and lonely just like humans do and they will do just about
anything to release some energy or catch your attention.

You can also use other tricks like the “QUIET” command, which you will have to
implement whenever he barks senselessly. You wouldn’t have much trouble teaching the
“QUIET” command if you’ve already established yourself as the alpha of the pack. If
your dog’s barking is already killing your chances with your hot neighbor, though then
you might want to get a collar but ONLY as a temporary thing or as a training
supplement.

The sonar collar is most recommended as it is not just humane, but more efficient than
the two as well. Never forget to tackle the problem with hands-on solutions and
obedience training as well. Training your dog to respond to obedience signals is still the
best and lasting way to eliminate dog barking behavior but still maintain his freedom to
do what he naturally does.

Training your puppy not to bite
Bringing home a new puppy is always an exciting time. Introducing the new puppy to the
family should be fun for both yourself and your puppy.

One of the first challenges however is curbing tasteless puppy behaviors. Biting and
mouthing is a typical activity for a lot of young puppies and dogs. The first part of
training the puppy is to halt the biting reflex. Biting could be lovable and safe with a five
pound puppy, but it is neither lovable nor safe when that dog has grown to adulthood.

Thus, puppies should be taught to regulate their bite before they reach the age of 4
months. It is so up to the humans in the puppy’s life to educate this lesson. One good
way to slow down the biting reflex is to permit the puppy to play and socialise with other
puppies and socialised older dogs. Puppies love to tumble, roll and play with one another,
and when puppies play they bite one another continually. This is the most effective way
for puppies to learn how to control themselves when they bite. If one puppy becomes too
coarse while playing, the remainder of the group will punish him for that unbecoming
behavior. Thru this kind of socialization, the puppy will learn how to control his biting
reflex. In addition, shortage of socialization in puppies frequently causes fearful and
assertive behaviors to develop.

Dogs frequently react aggressively to new scenarios, particularly if they’re not correctly
socialised.

It’s important, so, to introduce the puppy to both kids and adults.

The best time to socialize a puppy to young youngsters is when it remains very young,
typically when it is 4 months old or younger. This is particularly true with giant breed
dogs, or with breeds of dogs with a name for assertive behavior. Training your puppy to
trust and respect you is a particularly satisfactory way to stop biting. Gaining the trust and
respect of your dog is the foundation for all dog coaching, and for correcting problem
behaviors. It’s important to never hit or slap the puppy, either during coaching or any
other time. Reprimanding a dog won’t stop him from biting it’ll simply frighten and
confuse him.




The best house training for dogs
The best house training uses the dog’s own instincts to avoid soiling its bed to train the
dog where and where not to eliminate.

That is the basis behind crate coaching, in which the dog is confined to its crate with a
lack of the owner, and den training, in which the dog is confined to a tiny area of the
home. This kind of coaching customarily works really well, both for puppies and for
older dogs. Issues with this kind of toilet coaching are sometimes the result of not
understanding the signals the dog is sending, not being consistent with feeding times, or
attempting to rush the method. It is always best to house train the dog correctly the 1st
time than to go back and retrain an issue dog. If the dog continues to soil the den area
after house training, the likeliest reason is the owner has left the dog in the den for too
much time. In this example, the best methodology is to make the den area smaller or to
take the dog to the toilet area more often. If the dog soils the bed which has been
provided in the den area, it is most likely because the owner has left the dog there for too
much time, and the dog had a comprehensible accident.

Or it might be the dog hasn’t yet adopted this area as the bed.

It’s important to have the dog entirely checked out by a vet to rule out any medical issues.
Dogs who are bored frequently drink large quantities of water and so must urinate more
often than you might think. If you notice your dog consuming big quantities of water, be
certain to take the dog to the established toilet area more frequently, and supply the dog
with toys and other distractions to eliminate boredom.
In a number of cases dogs can react to the den like it is a jail or a punishment. It’s
important for the dog to feel safe in its den, and to consider it as a home and not a cage.
The only way to house train a puppy or dog, or to re-house train a difficulty dog, is to
make yourself conscious of the dog’s habits and desires.

The correct dog training methods
Correctly training and socializing a puppy is urgent to making it a valued member of your
family and your community. One reason is the puppy is largely a “blank canvas”,
untroubled by past coaching methodologies and other issues. One challenge to training a
new puppy is that puppies are far more easily distracted than adult dogs. For this reason,
it’s best to keep coaching sessions short when working with a puppy, and to finish each
coaching sessions on a positive note.

It’s also vital to permit the puppy lots of time to play, and to have interaction with other
puppies and dogs. Socialization coaching is vital to making your new puppy a good dog
voter, as dog aggression is a growing problem in plenty of areas. A correctly socialised
dog learns the way to play properly with other dogs, and overly assertive play is punished
by the other dogs in the play group. Unfit behavior, for example hard biting or scratching,
is punished by the other puppies, by the mother dog, or both.

Training your dog to be obedient and responsive, even in the face of several distractions,
is vital when coaching dogs and puppies. One good way to socialize your puppy both to
new folks and new dogs is to take it on a visit to your local pet store. It’s important for
puppy owners to structure their pet’s environment so the puppy is rewarded for good
behaviors and not rewarded for others. Whilst it’s correct that jumping can be lovable for
a ten pound puppy, it won’t be so lovable when that puppy has grown into an one
hundred pound dog.

This kind of positive reinforcement will result in a well behaved adult dog that could be a
valued member of both the family and the community at large. For example, training a
puppy to employ a unique surface like gravel or asphalt is a good method.

The idea is the puppy will associate this surface with going potty, and thus be disinclined
to use other surfaces.




Coupons For Dog Food - Saving On Dog Food Bills
While you may know pet owners that have just one dog in their home, most have more
than one. Several might have three or more. Pups are outstanding companions to their
owners, but they are much happier if they have another of their own kind that lives near
them. They also seem to keep one another company when their people are away, or when
their people simply do not have the time to be with them. Caring for a number of dogs is
enjoyable and a noble idea, but it could well be that you have to keep an eye out for dog
food store coupons so that feeding them all won’t leave you broke.

Watch out for coupons for dog food that are usually in the magazines that come with your
Sunday paper. It’s possible that these coupons will not be for your usual brands, but you
can usually find something that can save you a bit of cash. While you might have a
favorite brand of food, you may want to find some others that are every bit as good for
your dogs so that you can expand your options when it comes to using the coupons for
dog food to save cash on feeding your four legged friends.

You can also go Online to source dog food coupons. You may even source coupons for
free food from different dog food suppliers. Dog food companies sometimes offer dog
food samples - that can at times be quite considerable - so that you get to try out the
different foods for yourself. They are hopeful that your dogs will really go for their brand,
and that you will continue to buy their brand over and over again. It might be worth your
while to take advantage of these offers of free pet food, and you may just find a dog food
that your dogs like more than the dog food that you normally use the most. After that,
they may offer you even more dry dog food coupons if you join their mailing list either in
postal or email lists.

Close by you’ll find other places for dog food store coupons that one can try to use. You
can coax your vet for coupons, though keep in mind veterinarians may only deal with the
more expensive dog food brands. Keep an eye out for mail flyers from other stores, even
if they are stores where you commonly do not buy your dog food. Also look for discounts
by finding a warehouse store, or a pet food company that has a nearby department store.

How To Choose The Right Puppy
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 25, 2008


One of the most important considerations regarding bringing a puppy to your home is to
choose one that will fit in with your family and your lifestyle. For those who are very
relaxed about life bringing home a pet that is very active will not make much sense as it
will not suit you or the puppy. You need to choose your pet according to his ability to
bond with you and to be a part of your lifestyle.

Exercise Is Important

Another important aspect to choosing your puppy is to address the need for him to get
plenty of exercise though a tiny breed such as a Boston terrier or even a Cocker Spaniel
will not require quite as much exercise as do larger sized dogs such as Labradors and
Alsatians. You should also think ahead about the nature of your puppy.

For those people that have young children about the home it makes sense to choose their
puppy from a breed that is known for its gentleness and so you must consider choosing
from breeds such as collies, bulldogs as well as chows. You will of course need to spend
some time researching various dog breed and then make your choice as wisely as
possible.

However, if you wish for more security about your home then you would certainly need
to check out different dog breeds including Dobermans and German Shepherds as well as
Boxers. Such breeds know their surroundings well and will always alert you in case of
suspicious activity in the vicinity of your home.

Another way of choosing a puppy is to know how well a particular breed trains because
breeds such as Golden Retrievers and Irish Settlers are easy to train while other breeds
require more effort in getting them to be well behaved. You might also want to pick a
puppy that is good in the water and so your efforts should be focused on picking from
Otter hounds, and American water hounds as they are very attracted to being in the water.

All said and done, choosing the right puppy represents a major decision which should be
taken after giving plenty of thought and exercising a lot of care. In addition, once you
have acquired a puppy you should then sit down and pick a suitable puppy name. In fact,
this process also requires showing extra consideration since your puppy is going to be
with you for many years and you want to pick a name for him that will give you pleasure
and which will also make owning a pet that much more fun.
A number of aspects need to be considered before bringing home a puppy. If you act
wisely and carefully, the latest member of your family will surely prove to be a great joy
for everyone.

Case Study on Dog Jumping
Isabel had always loved and wanted a small dog to keep her company. That is the reason
why when she got her first apartment in New Jersey, Isabel make it a point that the
neighborhood was dog-friendly. One early morning, she came across a nice family that
was giving away some mixed breed puppies, she picked and brought home a little girl
pup that was bouncy and full of energy, just like her! It was the best feeling she have ever
felt in years.



When Isabel first got Tiny, she enjoyed watching her bounce up and down, and loved it
especially when Tiny welcomes her at the door when she comes home from work. Yet
one day, when Isabel brought over her four-year old niece she noticed that Tiny would
not stop running around and jumping on her, causing her niece to fall over and hurt
herself. Isabel then thought of all the snagged sweaters and times that the jumping habit
got out of hand. She decided then and there that the jumping behavior had to stop!



Isabel began her quest to stop Tiny from this risky behavior by seeking some expert
advice. She spoke with trainers and scoured bookstores to find the right technique for
training dogs on stopping dog jumping . So she set her mind to giving Tiny a lot of love,
but she also decided that she would have to be firm in her decision and be really
committed to keeping up the training in the long term, too.



Isabel started to daunt off Tiny’s jumping behavior by commanding, “Down!” every time
she enters the room. Because it was an easy word for everyone to use, she has chosen the
word “down”. Every time she walked in the door, she would firmly say “Down!” until
Tiny was no longer jumping and acting over excited to see her. The training got her a
little frustrated at first, because Tiny just was not getting the command. Isabel even tried
giving Tiny a little nudge to get her to back off while she firmly said, “Down.” Yet after a
week, Isabel began to see that it was taking fewer and fewer commands to get Tiny to
control jumping and she felt that the hard work was not wasted .



Few weeks have passed by, and it was taking no more than two “Down” commands for
Tiny to stop jumping. Once Tiny had observed that she would gain praise for not jumping
at all, the behavior started to cease completely. After a few months, Isabel felt
comfortable bringing her niece again over to her house to play with Tiny, and found that
the two of them now got along beautifully. Her niece even feels that Tiny is now her new
best friend!



From Isabel’s status, we can see that it will for sure take some time, patience, and
consistency to train a dog to stop an unbecoming behavior. But, always bear in mind that
not all dogs can be taught simply at home. Isabel was prepared to use a trainer for
assistance in curbing Tiny’s behavior, but found that her patience paid off in the end. The
key was using a consistent command and praising Tiny greatly when she behaved.

Great Tips for Dog Obedience Training
Dogs have a lot of loveable natural qualities, but they also have some not-so-cute
behaviors. Digging is one of the latter, but it can persist as they bury bones, create
impromptu shelters, and just feel the dirt between their paws.

This natural behavior can wreak havoc on your yard and garden if it goes unchecked.
What is the best way to curb the digging impulse?

As with children, dogs do things for a reason. Why is your dog digging? If you can figure
this out, you are halfway to a solution. Does he just love to fling dirt?

Some dogs do enjoy the act of digging, but others use it to communicate with you. They
may be crying out for attention or more exercise. They may need a shelter to stay warm
or cool. They may be burying food. If you’ve recently put down fertilizer or dug in your
garden, your dog may be responding to the scents.

If you can determine why your dog is digging, you can take appropriate action. For
instance, do you notice your dog digging when it is very hot? He could simply be seeking
some shelter from the sun. Remedying the situation by getting a doghouse or taking the
dog inside will most likely stop the digging. Dog training collars can help to change
mischievous habits.

If the problem persists, try one of the following:

1. Find the spots your dog usually digs and bury a balloon that has been inflated. If your
dog digs, he’ll pop the balloon. This unpleasant reaction to his digging can deter him
from continuing.
2. Along the same lines, you can mix in his feces when you refill a hole he’s dug. Dogs
will often return to the same spots, and when he discovers the feces, he’ll be turned off
digging.

3. Chicken wire is another thing you can bury in your yard to deter your dog from
digging. He’ll hate the feeling of his claws against the wire and will be prompted to stop.

4. When you catch your dog digging, give him a spray from a water bottle or hose. They
hate this (but it is not harmful). They will learn to associate the punishment with the
crime. Only do this when you catch him digging or he will not connect the behavior with
the consequence.

Digging is natural, but it doesn’t have to ruin your yard. Figure out why your dog is
engaging in this behavior and take a little time to work on it with him. You’ll both be
much happier. Not unlike puppy potty training, naughty habits can be corrected with a
little coaching.

Clicker Training - A Great Training Technique

The use of clickers in dog training has increased in recent years. It is a gentle way to
condition your dog to repeat good behavior.

Clicker training works on the principle of operant conditioning. This is when a behavior
is repeated because a reward is associated with it. Here is some more on how clicker
training works:

You will need a clicker. This is simply a handheld plastic box. A metal strip is attached.
Depressing the strip causes a sharp click.

When you first start click training, you pair the click with a reward, such as a dog biscuit.
When the dog performs a command well, you click immediately and offer the treat.

The dog learns to associate the click with the behavior and the click with the treat, which
makes it more likely that he’ll repeat it. Soon, just the click will be enough, and
eventually, it can be phased out altogether.

Clicking is immediate. Dogs need to know exactly what they are being praised for, and
the clicking sound helps let them know. This is why the clicker method is so effective for
training.

Your dog really wants to make you proud. Using the clicker method is a great way to
teach your dog in an effective and humane manner.

Be educated about your pet’s behaviour issues and needs, learn more about dog
obedience training.

Your Garden and Your Dog!
Summer is here! It’s still cold around here, but, still, summer is here. For a lot of people
that means that they can, at least for a few months, enjoy the two greatest loves in their
life; their dog and their garden.

Unfortunately, the two do not always get along. The garden starts to grow. Visions of
flowers, herbs and vegetables are in your head. Your dog also has visions…visions of
playing in the green grass, in the shade of the batch of lilies that are growing in the
corner. I know my black lab, Benny, loved to lie in the midst of the lilies and hide. He
would stretch out like a torpedo. Heck one day I couldn’t find him at all, I thought he
was lost.

But, along with all those wonderful visions comes danger for your dog. So, here are a
few tips and tricks for you.

- Remember, Bored dogs get into trouble. A dog needs a walk, no matter how big your
property. A dog needs a walk, that steady, fast forward walk.

- Teach your dog a cue; one sentence that means “get out of the garden”. I did that with
my two, and it works! It means you have to spend a little extra attention on your dog at
the beginning. But it works. By the way, this is also good if you take your dog visiting.
It means your dog will learn to respect all gardens.

- There are pet friendly “pet repellents” available. Please, make sure that they are safe. A
beautiful garden is not worth the life of your pet.

- At the beginning of the season, if you have a place you don’t want your dog to go, put
down some bristled twigs; it will reinforce the “get out of the garden” phrase you will say
when your dog goes to that spot.

And mostly, please be aware for the Safety of your pets.

- Try to chose other than chemicals for lawn and garden care. Even organic garden
products can be dangerous to your pets. If you have a need to use them, keep your pets
away, usually for 24 hours.

- A lot of the garden fertilizers are made of “animal bone meal” which is very attractive to
dogs. Please use an alternative. Become aware of what you use around your dog.
Especially if you have a new dog or puppy.

- Also, certain plants are poisonous to dogs.

Become aware of what could hurt your pet, and have a great summer!

Stop Dog Chewing
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 23, 2008


Do you have a problem with dog chewing? A dog that loves to chew on anything he sees
interesting and you can’t seem to figure out why he has this kind of passion? Did you
ever come home from work and found your newest pair of shoes being chewed upon by
your, cute, sweet and innocent, little dog? If this is a familiar scenario to you, I suggest
that you continue to read on.



One of the worst habits that any dog can pick up is chewing. In addition to being
destructive to your property , a a dog chewing might get injured by breaking its teeth or
swallowing harmful material. Worse, , some dogs gnaw on themselves! This kind of bad
behavior may cause hair loss and even serious infections to areas of their bodies like their
tails, legs, and feet. If you have a problem with dog chewing, work to immediately
correct the situation instead of dismissing the act as a typical dog behavior.



Chewing is a known behavior of puppies . However, their choices of what to chew on
will be directly dependent upon you . If you are welcoming a new puppy into your home,
be sure to supply it with adequate toys to prevent your pooch from destroying your home,
car, or wardrobe. Furthermore , be sure to choose toys that cannot be mistaken for those
“out of bound” items. To somehow redirect its attention from the new pair they have just
bought, many dog owners prefer to grant their pups with cast off shoes but to their
surprise the puppy would still chew up on their brand new pair instead. Look for bones
and toys that are meant to be used as a chewing toy that will not splinter, break, or split
and potentially cause a choking hazard. Also, provide your puppy with several different
toys in various areas so that he does not become bored and opt to gnaw on your beloved
items and furniture as an alternative.



Yes, there are simple steps that can help you prevent your dog from chewing up your
possessions! For starters, the easiest way to stop this routine is to keep an eye on your
dog. Dogs cannot chew up your house and home while you sit watching them. A huge
part of dog ownership is VIGILANCE. Besides, think about keeping your dog to a room
or area of your home until you can trust him to have free rein of your abode. In addition
to vigilance, cleanliness is a large factor in what a dog has access to chew. Simply put,
your dog cannot chew your shoes unless they were left accessible. If you find your dog
chewing something, if possible, place it out of his reach. In all likelihood , the dog will
continue chewing the same item until it is either removed or completely destroyed.



“But what about the larger things like furniture, doors, or appliances that will be hard to
move”, you say? For these structures, apply a thin film of Bitter Apple. Like its name
suggests, this solution is quite bitter and very unsavory for dogs. Available in a spray or
cream, Bitter Apple will not damage the finish of your furniture and can easily be wiped
away once the dog learns not the chew. Don’t be alarmed if your dog does ingest the
material, it will not make him sick, as the contents of it are non-toxic.



Lastly, be the protector of your own things. Teach your dog commands like “leave it” and
instruct him to cease and desist the gnawing of your items. Use a spray bottle or a shaker
device rather than physical punishment, which can sometime cause dogs to become more
destructive in protest. If your dog is chewing on himself more than your home,
immediately visit your veterinarian. There are a lot of skin conditions, including parasitic
infections that can cause a dog to chew on his own skin in order to find relief. Turn to a
cooling spray that will provide relief as the area begins to heal. Also, use an antibiotic
cream to prevent infection.

Some Basics About Your New Best Friend
The Dog Whisperer,Cesar Milan, says, “There are no bad dogs. Only bad dog
owners.” So You need to ask am I ready for the responsibility of owning a dog?
No matter what breed you bring into your home, in the end, you are the one
responsible for your dog’s behavior. Learn all you can about the dog you hope to own.
Even the feared Pit Bull is a sweet loving dog in the right hands.

Most people like cuddly puppies and grown-up dogs. But before you welcome a new dog
into
your home, there are some things you need to think through to be sure both you and your
new best friend are happy and healthy.

Remember that dogs, no matter what they are today, were predators in the past. Wolves,
hyenas, dingoes, and foxes are carnivorous creatures who hunt to survive. Dogs were
most
likely domesticated from their canine ancestors from 20,000-30,000 years ago. In fact,
the many dog breeds have only proliferated in the last 200 to 300 years. Before that, a
few breeds existed to meet their masters’ needs for work.
When you own a dog, remember that the wolf is somewhere in there hiding. Depending
on its
breed and the way you treat it, that wolf could surprise you with a quick snip or a more
vicious attack. Careful selection and training of your dog will assure that your best friend
remains a best friend.

Before you select a dog, do your homework. Become familiar with dog breeds and
personality
traits, and compare these to your personal reasons for having a dog. Do you want a cute,
cuddly friend to dress up and carry around? Do you want a champion at dog agility
competitions or a champion show dog? Do you want a companion for your children? Or
do you want a body guard and home protector? Do you need support to cope with a
disability?

Each breed has characteristics that indicate what your life with your new friend will be
like. If you aren’t very patient or don’t like a lot of noise, you probably shouldn’t adopt a
small, energetic dog with lots of demands for attention. If you want an affectionate loyal
companion, you might want to consider a Golden or Labrador Retriever or a Collie. If
you want to protect your property, you might take a look at a German Shepherd, a
Rottweiler, or a Doberman Pincher.

If your household includes young children, your choice should be a careful one. Your
new dog
will have to be patient and tolerate with kindness having its tail pulled, being jumped on,
and
engaged in wrestling for hours on end. Bulldogs, American Eskimo dogs, Beagles,
Retrievers,
Setters, Sheepdogs, and many Terriers are among the many breeds good with children.

Want a dog you can dress up and put in cute clothes? Then look for a dog that has plenty
of
hair (for those fancy hair-dos) and is small enough to carry around. “Designer dogs” like
Poodles, Yorkies and Westies, Bichon Frises, Pomeranians, and the more exotic Shih Tzu
are
excellent candidates for this.

If you’re looking for protection, be sure to look at breeds that aren’t too friendly to
strangers. Great Danes are huge and intimidating, but they will likely to fall in love with
the first burglar they meet! Bulldogs are another breed that look fierce but come out
kissing. German Shepherds are probably the most familiar and trainable guard dogs.
Other breeds also protect your home and family: Rottweilers, Boxers, Doberman
Pinchers, and Giant Schnauzers are among them. There are a few breeds that were
created for their ferociousness. Rottweilers and Pit Bull Terriers are notorious for vicious
attacks. So if you are considering these breeds, you must be very clear about what to
expect and very careful in training a well-behaved dog.
When you decide to bring a dog into your home, you need to be educated about what you
need, what you want, and what breed will most likely fulfill your goals. When you adopt
a dog, you are adding a member to your family - one for which you will be responsible
for a lifetime. You should be committed to working through all the behavioral and
training kinks and providing a stable, loving home. You’ll not only have to train your
dog, but you’ll have to be trained in how to handle that dog.

No matter what breed you think you want, you should know about the specific dog’s
parentage, personal history, and temperament before making the commitment to be his
lifetime caretaker and friend.

Effective dog training

dog-training/”>Effective dog training

Knowing how dogs developed, and how dogs have interaction with one another, is crucial
to knowing how to properly train your dog to be a devoted, steadfast companion. The
first dogs were doubtless orphaned wolf puppies adopted by early humans.

In return for these valued behaviors, the humans probably supplied their new companions
with foods, protection and shelter. When organizing a dog coaching program, it is vital to
know that dogs are pack animals.

In wild dog societies, packs are formed, and each member of the pack quickly learns their
place in the pecking order.

Apart from in the event of death or injury to the alpha dog, the hierarchy never changes
once it’s been established. The lower dogs know not to test the alpha dog, and the alpha
dog understand his place as leader of the pack. To correctly train your dog and gain its
respect, it’s important for you to become the alpha dog. That is because a dog that sees its
owner as a superior leader will follow the commands the owner gives without query.
Getting the status of the dog is the most vital step to proper dog coaching, and it’ll form
the foundation of all successive coaching. The explanations for training a dog correctly
are many particularly in today’s world. A well behaved, obedient dog is a joy to be
around, both for the owner and their family, and for folks hereabouts at large. In addition,
seeing a well behaved dog sets folk’s mind at ease, particularly with breeds of dog
thought to be perilous,eg Dobermans, rottweilers and pit bulls. A lot of dogs exhibit
neglected behaviors as a consequence of stress in the animal’s life, and its incapacity to
deal with that stress.
The goal of a good dog training program is to permit the dog to put up with larger levels
of stress without changing into a problem animal. One feature that humans and dogs do
share, however, is the necessity to form close social groups and powerful bonds inside
those social groups.

Training Tips on Stopping Dog Aggression
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 22, 2008


Though the media significantly embellished the level of canine aggression, it is still a fact
that 2 percent of our communities are victims of dog bites each year and 1 percent of
dogs bite humans. If you observed your dog becoming aggressive, there are various
quality ways to eliminate dog aggression you can bring into play to reduce the aggressive
behaviors so that your dog does not become a statistic. Nevertheless, one of the best dog
aggression training methods is prevention itself.



Although prevention is important in minimizing the potential for dog aggression, there
are some dog aggression training process that will perfectly to reduce the unwanted
behaviors in your dog. Some of these dog aggression training methods involve your dog,
but some involve training you and the people that normally interact with your dog. Dog
aggression is not just a dog problem; it is a people problem, too.



Primarily , before you start with any training methods for eliminating dog aggression,
you need to recognize what is causing the aggression in your dog. To determine which
dog aggression training method you can use, put into consideration the triggers of your
dog’s aggression.



Fear and dominance are the two most common reasons for dog aggression, which can be
curbed through training. But still, aggression caused by things like maternal instincts or
food requires more of a change in human behavior, by not challenging the situations. If
your dog has a medical reason for the aggression, you will perhaps need to see a
veterinarian to acquire treatment.



On the other hand, dominance aggression requires a bit of an unusual training approach.
Dominance aggression starts when your dog considers you part of his or her pack, and
they would like to establish themselves as the “alpha dog.” Respect exercise is practically
the best approach. This kind of technique trains your dog to look to you for “permission”
before doing anything.



Start by letting the dog acknowledge that you have control over everything. So that your
dog cannot obtain what he or she wants without your permission, toys, beds, food, walks,
even affection should to be within your control. You can establish this by commanding
that your dog sit before it gets what it wants. Do not confer when your dog do not follow
what you want him or her to do. Use a rattle or clicker to get his or her attention if your
dog does not pay attention to you. Refrain from giving your dog praise not unless they do
what you want, then praise them considerably . Also refrain from games like tug of war,
which promotes the desire for dominance.



Just as you are trying to use dog aggression training methods to minimize aggressive
behavior based on fear or dominance, you need to realize that during the initial training
you will definitely see an increase of aggression or rebellion in your dog. Keep in mind, a
dog functions at the same age level as a two or three year old, so it takes a lot more for
them to realize what you want them to do, and they do not figure out that the training is
really in their best interest. Be patient with your dog during this time and be acquainted
that you are being a conscientious and responsible pet owner by using these dog
aggression training methods to teach your dog how to live and act appropriately around
humans.

Case Study on Dog Whining Behavior
Toby and Josie are two Doberman Pinschers that have grown up in a nice suburban home
together. The owner, Ms. Vicky, has no objection about the behaviors of the two dogs,
with the exception of the fact that they whine incessantly. Seeing as her prince and
princess do not have any aggressive tendencies, are not territorial, or have any other bad
habits, she has overlooked this problem with whining for years. However, as years passed
by, the whining became irritably annoying and Ms. Vicky began to speculate exactly why
they are always whining.
In an attempt to curb this behavior, she dedicated her time to find the root of the problem.
Sometimes, dogs whine for a lot of reasons, including pain, fear, or boredom. In this
instance, she thought that the cause of the whining was probably boredom, but she also
felt that the other reasons should not be completely ruled out and so she decided to seek
for the expert’s opinion. Toby and Josie’s owner brought the pair to the vet’s office to get
more information on the situation. The veterinarian believed that the dog whining
behavior stemmed from Toby and Josie being left alone for a large portion of the day
while Ms. Vicky was at work. Although Toby and Josie were placed outdoors, so they can
play, do their business, and exercise at will, the pair was still lonely. Given that this
behavior has never been checked, the dogs have acquired the habit as a sympathy ploy to
get what they want. The Miss confirmed this idea and the next step of breaking the habit
started.



First of all , Toby and Josie were noticeably not okay with their current condition of being
left alone during the morning. To make her dearly loved prince and princess happier,
Vicky hired a pet sitter who comes in twice a day to walk, pet, and play with Toby and
Josie. Despite the fact that the whining is still present, they’ve observed that the two dogs
seem to be much happier when their owner returns from work. If only Ms. Vicky did not
let this whining to continue for such a long period of time and corrected the problem
sooner, this new setup would have likely stopped the whining altogether.



In the mean time, the owner began to put into practice the new training method for the
two dogs. Every time any of the dog whines, she firmly states “no whine.” She gives this
command with a quick squirt of water from a spray bottle to get the dog’s attention. Once
the dog stops whining, the Miss lavishes it with praises and treats. Once the dog stops
whining, the Miss lavishes it with praises and treats. Of course, tasks like going outside
cannot be punished, since many dogs whine when they require to relieve themselves.



This training method coupled with the hiring of a pet sitter has drastically changed the
whining condition with Toby and Josie. Now, neither dog whines to get what they want!
Furthermore, Miss Vicky finds the situation a great deal less stressful on both her and the
dogs. If you too are experiencing a similar situation, consider following this case study to
help break your dogs from whining. Keep in mind that pain or uneasiness is a viable
motive for whining, so visit your veterinarian to guarantee your dog is in top health. Best
of Luck! Cheers!

Going For The Free Puppy Adoption
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 21, 2008
While the best place to pick up a new puppy is always the pound because those pups are
facing being put down, it is certainly not a free puppy adoption. There are fees involved
with getting a puppy from the pound so you need to be prepared to have anywhere from
fifty to one hundred dollars to take a puppy home from the pound. Whether it is a free
pug puppy you are looking for or any other free puppy would work for you, you are
going to have to look elsewhere besides the pound if you are looking for a truly free
puppy adoption.

There are a lot of ways to get a new pet through a free puppy adoption but if you are
wanting to go the free route because you do not have a penny to your name then adopting
a dog may not be the best thing for you or the dog at this point in time. This is because
puppies and dogs cost a lot of money and they will need a lot of care which means
keeping up on their shots and having them groomed on a regular basis. If you are going
for the free puppy adoption because you do not have the money to buy a dog, then you
really cannot afford to raise one.

Where To Look For That Special Dog

If you can truly afford to care for the pet properly but you just prefer the free puppy
adoption as opposed to paying for a dog, then by all means, go for the free puppy. Once
you know that you are for sure ready to bring a new pet into your home, then you can
start searching out the places that offer free puppy adoption. The classifieds are generally
the best way to go about finding free puppy adoption. A lot of people are willing to share
their puppies with the world with no cost involved. Check the online classifieds, as well
as there are many people who only post on the web instead of going through the paper.

There are also a lot of flyers or advertisements placed on bulletin boards of grocery
stores, department stores, and especially pet stores where there are pups up for free puppy
adoption. Once you find the puppy that you want you will want to act ask as adorable
puppies always go fast. And they go even faster when it is a free puppy adoption being
offered as so many people are looking for the same thing as you.

Dogs with Nose for Poop Answer Nature’s Call
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 21, 2008


When a group of naturalists gathers around a campfire, sooner or later their discussion
turns to poop. Not gross-out, potty-mouth, teenager talk, but the poop they saw in the
field that day.

Second only to tracks, poop, more formally referred to as scat, is a tell-all tool that
indicates what animals have been in an area, when, and what they were eating.
Now, thanks to Samuel Wasser, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at the
University of Washington, and the pound puppies he has trained, poop has become one of
the premier tools of remote sensing in studying threatened animal populations.

Dog Obedience Training
Simple Principles in Dog Obedience Training

Dogs, even when their breeding is maximized and well-adapted to human needs, will
always need some basic obedience training as they would never figure this out on their
own. Obedience training requires the use of some principles which differentiate effective
training, from training without results. They are the following:

Principle One: CONSISTENCY

The first rule in obedience training is to be consistent. You need to be consistent in the
words you use, the tone they are spoken in and the actions that accompany them. Before
you begin training you will need to come to an agreement with the dog owner on what it
is they are wanting the dog to learn and how to accomplish it.

For example saying the word “come”, does not make any sense to a dog. He does not
understand things the way humans think and he does not understand the language we use.
So to make the training understandable, you should use the command in a very consistent
manner so that the dog will learn to associate the word with the meaning you attach with
it.

An example would be if you use the word, “come”, then you need to make sure everyone
else in the household using the same word. When using the word command, “Come”, you
should work with the dog to understand this means to approach the giver of the
command. So if you are using this command make it a point not to do actions that would
make the command confusing for the dog.

Don’t be deterred in your training efforts if the dog does not come to your right away, be
patient and don’t force or scold him. If you punish the dog over and over after giving the
command they will begin to associate the word with the punishment. The dog will not
want to follow the same command because in his mind it leads to punishment.

Being consistent in your dog commands is to be followed by anyone who works with the
dog. For example, if you are using the command “come”, other people in the household
should not replace it with words like “here” or, “come here boy”.

Second Principle: Keep It Short
Both the amount of time you spend training and the words you use as commands should
be kept short. Keep in mind that the attention span of dogs is very short and that getting
them engrossed with a specific activity can be very hard, if not impossible. Puppies
usually react to a specific stimulus, but not for a very long time, they may begin to chase
a moving toy, and quickly lose interest, then move on to the next thing.

They simply don’t possess the same amount of interest they had when they started the
activity and they become easily bored. The same thing happens in training therefore, it
should be limited only to 10 minutes to 15 minutes of regular training.

Third Principle: No Punishment or Force Allowed

A trainer should never hurt the dog in any way, you should make it a goal to have the
training be a positive experience for all involved. You should absolutely never punish a
dog just because he did not do something he wasn’t prepared for, nor force a dog to do
something he does not understand.

Don’t push the animal too hard while dog training. A good trainer realizes dogs do not
learn things instantly and so they are very patient and show understanding towards the
animal they are working with. If you are angry the dogs can sense it but does not know
why.

You must avoid negative experiences related to training so you should not force your dog
to obey your commands. If he knows that he is praised when he does something right, he
should not be praised when he does not follow a command.

Drugless Flea and Roach Solution
Some years ago, I hosted a talk show on health on a Palm Beach radio station. Someone
called in, and wanted to know what to do about fleas, as she was violently allergic to the
various poisons that people put on the back of the neck of their dogs. (Most dogs and cats
dislike them as well.)

Years previously I had found a solution, so I gave it to her. Buy Boric Acid in a large
“squeeze bottle”. It’s in a fine white poweder, and if you squeeze the plastic bottle, it
comes out in a fine spray.

Begin by vacuuming the carpets particularly where a pet may lie or sleep. After a
thorough vacuuming, go around squeezing the boric acid in a cloud all over the carpet.
You’ll have to brush some of the excess into the carpet with your shoes, or a broom.

It will take a week or so, but after that, even with outdoor cats and dogs, you will find
very few, or no fleas. Boric Acid is virtually harmless, to children, and your pets, but
deadly to most insects.
Another thing that I discovered more recently, is a product sold at many health food
stores. It’s a product made with mixing common yeast and garlic powder. Mix a half
teaspoon or so into their food every day. Surprisingly, my cats love it mixed into canned
tuna. I thought the garlic odor would be a problem, but it’s not.

This helps keep fleas at a distance outside. You might be able to barely smell the garlic on
the skin of your pets if you smell closely. It’s also healthy as the yeast has B vitamins,
and the garlic is a natural healthy food for man and beast.

Let’s look at cockroaches next. They’re the “survivors” for millions of years, and will
probably survive after all humans have gone the way of the dinosaurs. No housewife
likes them, and even most clean houses may have a few in hiding. In South Florida, we
have flying cockroaches almost as big as mice, and lots of smaller ones also along with
many other insects. Except for ants. Boric Acid works very well.

Boric Acid in the carpets, particularly around the edges and baseboards, keeps your pets
pretty free. But, there are a few places where it pays to keep them out as well. Get a few
beer bottle caps, and put a small amount of Boric Acid into these caps.

Put the Boric Acid caps into the corner of cupboards. If you have paper in the bottom of
your kitchen drawers (or cabinet shelves), take up the

Paper, spray a small amount and replace paper. Don’t forget to spray the Boric Acid under
the refrigerator, and the stove.

That night, the entire program was taken up with callers, some telling us how well this
worked for them, or asking more questions. Several people called the next time the
program was on to thank me and some of my listeners for the above advice.

Much later, I learned how to stop ants, including fire ants. Simply empty one or more
“blue” packages of NutraSweet (Aspartame) onto the nest. The ant hills are gone by the
next day usually. To prevent them from entering your home, sprinkle a few grains in the
baseboards or any possible entry holes into your home. Aspartame seems to be a deadly
poison to most insects, but particularly to ants.

If it’s that deadly to ants, what might it do to some susceptible humans? Many persons
are allergic to it. Not everybody is even aware of this problem. Aspartame often causes
headaches and other allergy symptoms. I never use Nutrisweet!

I hope that the above helps you to better health for you and your pets.




Cheap Dog Training Collars
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 19, 2008
Why Get Cheap Dog Training Collars?

Is it worth to invest in your dog’s training?

Some people are willing to invest a lot of money and time.

It is perfectly okay to buy very expensive dog collars if you prefer doing so. However,
you will find there are a great deal of choices for you to choose from that do not cost as
much. Collars range anywhere from fancy fashion dog collars, studded collars to a wide
variety of others. However, for some owners it is never practical to spend so much for an
item that could be obtained at a lesser price and also have the basic functions needed.

If you have a dog with a lot of energy or is highly curious you can find it stressful to train
them, as you learn to deal with all his behavior patterns.

If you find that after investing in your dogs training the results you get are not what you
looking for, then you should look at ways to begin cutting down on additional costs. An
option for cutting back on cost would be the type of dog training collar you use.

For many owners it does not make much sense if the dog does not respond well to
training to buy accessories, especially when the dog has begun nibbling on the corners of
the dog collar. It is important to realize that the behavior of the dog and teaching them to
respond to training is the main thing to focus on and not the collar, or any other
accessories.

Even though dog collars are instrumental in getting better control and correcting
unwanted dog behaviors, expensive collars can quickly effect your budget. This is the
reason why many owners resort to buying cheap dog training collars as good alternatives,
without having to sacrifice the function of the item, or adding an unnecessary financial
burden.

To get a cheap collar with good value it is best to first evaluate the product before looking
at how much it costs. It is a common mistake among buyers to use the cost as the basis
for assessing the value, rather then basing it on the function and reliability.

Cost is a good margin for getting the right collar, but it should not affect the way one sees
the item. You can find remarkable good dog training collars marked at an exceptionally
good price. However, since it is tagged with a low price the buyer might immediately
conclude that it does not perform well.

Remember, we were made to believe that price equals quality. You do not need to be in
the mindset of thinking’s items at the lower end of pricing are of less quality, while those
having expensive tags have the best quality. This can indeed be the truth for certain brand
names but is not always the case. So be sure to find the best bargains at their best prices.
When advanced technologies are integrated into the collar, they are often retailed at much
higher prices. The popular electronic dog collar is a good candidate. Electronic dog
collars can run in price range from $100 - $1000 depending on what options they come
with. You can expect a lot higher prices when more advanced technologies are used in
making the collar.

Since dog collars can cost hundreds of dollars many people find it impractical to spend
that much money on it, because it is a training accessory. With a little research you can
find the type of collar you want and in the price range your willing to spend.

Pet Insurance - Answering Your Questions
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 18, 2008


Most people are familiar with healthcare insurance for themselves and their family but
what about their pets? Pet insurance is a new idea in insurance to help cover the four-
legged members of the family. Granted, your workplace may not cover the insurance but
it is very valuable to have in case your pet becomes sick. Routine veterinary care may not
be expensive but if your pet was to become sick or injured, costs could quickly mount up
and be beyond your ability to repay. The old adage of “better to be safe than sorry” is
very true when it comes to insurance. It is better to have it and not need it than to find
yourself with a sick pet and no way of paying the vet bills. Most people are unaware or
inexperienced when it comes to pet insurance but this article will cover some of the
basics when it comes to what to expect in pet insurance.

How much can I expect to pay for insurance?

Pet insurance rates, much like our insurance rates, will vary according to each person.
Some insurance carriers decide the rate of their plans based on the person’s credit score.
Other underwriters do not use this method to determine the amount the insurance holder
will need to pay each month. The average plan will run around $30 a month for a dog and
$20 a month for a cat. There may be additional fees that vary according to the insurance
underwriter. Always make sure and check the information before you buy the insurance
policy. If you have any questions make sure and call the insurance company. If the wait is
an impossible amount of time or they seem vague on their knowledge, go to another
company. If they are that horrible with potential customer concerns imagine what they
would be like if you were a customer.

Is there a co-pay or deductible?

Just as you pay a deductible for your own health insurance, pet insurance also has a
deductible. But it is a significant amount lower. Most pet insurance deductibles are
$50.00 per accident category. Pet insurance does not work in the same manner as typical
healthcare insurance. At the time of the vet visit you will pay for the entire amount and
then fill out a claim form that is then submitted to the pet insurance carrier. The carrier
will pay you a set amount for that procedure. The costs allowed per procedure vary and
only the insurance company can determine what percentage you will have to pay after the
deductible.

How much out of pocket will I be expected to pay if my pet needs surgery?

Unfortunately the downside to pet insurance is that you will have to pay for the entire
amount out of your pocket before the insurance company pays you a portion back. When
you take your pet in for surgery you will need to take along a claim form that the
veterinarian will complete. After completing the form and filling out the claim
information, along with attaching copies of the receipts and invoices, you will mail or fax
the information to the insurance. After reviewing the information the insurance company
will mail out a check for the amount of the procedure they cover.

Some veterinary clinics will make payment arrangements with you in case of an
emergency. If you have a long history of good payments to your vet, you can discuss this
at a visit. Chances are high that he or she can work with you. The ultimate goal of both
you and the vet is a healthy and safe pet.

Is there a limit on what my pet insurance will pay out?

Yes, there is a limit on how much of the procedure is covered by the insurance company.
This amount varies depending on which insurance plan you select, what your deductible
is and how much the actual procedure runs. When you sign up for pet insurance the
company will provide you with a list of procedures they cover along with how much per
procedure is covered.

What if I have to rush my pet into the vet on an emergency?

If an accident were to happen to your pet and you had to rush them into an emergency,
your insurance is really of no use to you immediately. Unlike traditional healthcare
insurance, pet insurance does not place stipulations on where and when you can receive
care for your pet. You will have to pay the veterinary bill out of your own pocket and then
receive the allotted reimbursement allowed by your insurance carrier.

How to Stop Dog Digging
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 18, 2008
If walking through your yard has already become treacherous due to the number of holes
your dogs have put in your yard, then you need to learn to eliminate dog digging. Dogs
will dig for a number of reasons like anxiety, a desire to escape, or as a way to protect
themselves from outside forces. In order to be effective in your training, you should
understand why your dog is digging and learn effective versus ineffective techniques on
how to stop dogs from digging.



First, it is important that in order to get your dogs to stop digging, you must AVOID
reprimands during the trainings. It can only bring too many negative effects to your pet!
Dogs do not have good reasoning. If someone tells you that punishment is the right way
to stop dogs from digging, they do not understand that your dogs might rebel and just dig
when his all alone. Learning to get to the root of the behavior will do more in keeping
your dogs from digging, because you will be able to change the circumstances to fit your
needs while maintaining the respect and love of your dog.



In preventing your dogs , you may want to start off simply by taking your dogs for
regular walks. A lot of digging behavior comes out of boredom or a need to get rid of
extra energy. Taking your dogs for walks or taking time to actively play with your dog
can be effective to learn how to stop dog digging .



That same release of energy your dog needs bring about the next piece of advice on how
to stop dog digging. Keeping your dog active when you are not around is imperative to
stopping the digging behavior. Get toys that can keep them busy all throughout the day.
There are a number of active toys on the market that can help stimulate your dogs
physically and mentally so that digging is no longer needed as an activity.



The next thing you can do to stop dog digging is to put up a barrier to inhibit digging in
specific areas. If your dog is always digging up your flowerbed or vegetable garden, but
does not bother to dig anywhere else, then you may want to put up a small fence in that
area. You can also use a sprinkler. Who says that cats are the only pets who avoid getting
wet? Astonishingly, dogs usually do not like to get wet too, so when you see your dog
heading for your tomatoes, turn on the sprinkler.



Allowing your pet to have alternatives is another way to control your dog from digging in
other areas of your backyard. Giving your dog alternatives is another way to stop him
from digging in other areas of your yard. You can also offer your beloved pet a sandbox
or a corner of the yard where he can just dig away, well, which is if none of these
methods work. Build the area that will be exclusively his then hide several treats under,
HE WILL LOVE IT!! Through this method your dog will then learn the specific area
with such treats is only the place where digging is okay.



Last but the least, a not so pleasant way to curb this trait is to put a little of his solid dog
waste in each digging hole. Surprising as it may seem, the waste will deter your dog from
continuing to dig holes in the yard. It may not sound like the most uncomfortable way to
stop dogs from digging, but it truly does work!

one. The best thing to do is to start grabbing up all of the books and magazines you can
on free puppy training tips and hints so that you can begin to put certain rules and
techniques into place at home. In the meantime, while you work on that, you will also
want to look around for some free puppy training classes in your area.

It is extremely important that you find some free puppy training classes and get your
puppy signed up for them before they rip apart your home. Dealing with a puppy that
bites, chews, and goes to the bathroom all over your carpets is not the best way to start
the bonding process. Puppies and dogs that are left untrained may find that their owners
have a hard time connecting with them and therefore they be not get as much love and
attention from the owner. Do not let this happen between you and your puppy so go out
and get your pup signed up for a free puppy training course.

Where To Find The Classes

The best place to look is your local pet store to see if they offer any free puppy training
classes there. If they do you are going to want to sign up as quickly as possible so you do
not miss your chance at getting the training that your puppy needs so badly. If there are
not any classes offered there at the store, they may have information on where puppy
owners can go for some free puppy training courses. It is worth a shot to go and see what
you can find out because the sooner you get started the better off your puppy will be.

If your local pet store cannot offer you any suggestions on where you can go for free
puppy training then there are still other options so you do not want to give up. Start
calling around to the other pet shops in your area and do not forget to call the different
groomers or kennels in your area. These places may have some information for you on
free puppy training as people may have posted information on their bulletin board or
such. Just keep looking and you will eventually find the free puppy training class that you
have been waiting for.

Career Dog Training
Things to Know Before Considering a Career in Dog Training

People who are really passionate about dogs will sometime choose a life’s career in this
field so they can use their love for dogs everyday to help them, making it their goal to
become a professional dog trainer.

Do you fall in the category of people who pursue their career in dog training just because
someone said it is a good thing to do, or, because you have fallen so in love with dogs
and want to fall even deeper?

Respect for Fundamentals

Dog training is more than a love for dogs, it also requires a good deal of knowledge,
skills in handling, proper ways to discipline them and also knowing the basics of their
behaviors. Dog trainers usually have a long history of experience with dogs and
interaction with many dog owners, handlers and their pets.

Do You Know your Dogs Division?

You can choose one of two careers in working with dogs, the first would be ’The Pet
Service Training’ and the second, ’Dog Training’. Both have relatively high demands in
the market but there are a lot more opportunities in pet dog training than in service
training.

Pet dog training usually involves dogs that function merely as pets and as companions
therefore, most commonly they are taught obedience training, agility training, potty
training and training to eliminate unwanted behaviors like barking and biting.

Service training, on the other hand, involves specified training on services required by
people with disabilities and those undergoing therapy. Another division of service dogs
may include the following: chasing criminals, drug and bomb sniffing, search and rescue
dogs and hunting dogs.
Each of these take a large amount of dedication and patience on the trainers part as they
are very intense fields of specialize divisions.

Canine Psychology - What is It?

A good dog trainer will need to understand a dogs behavior, the way they think and why
they react to certain things. Trainers will need to constantly work with a dog to teach
them to react in a desired way to any given command. You should also know well the
fundamentals of associative conditioning.

Where Can You Learn Dog Training Education?

A dog training career requires that you have basic skills in dog training and handling.
There are no degrees in dog training yet, for there are no colleges and universities
offering such. However, there are dog “academies” or “schools” that could provide basic
training. Still it must be said the best dog trainers have a natural abilities with dogs and
are often self taught on how to be successful when handling them.

Some people learn by practical experience while others just have a certain natural talent
with dogs. There are also a number of dog training organizations that could provide the
latest information on dog training.

A good dog trainer works with both the attitudes of people and dogs

Dog training involves training the handlers of the dog as well Therefore if you are
pursuing a career in this field, it is very important that you have good people skills and
that you can tolerate all types of people.

There are impatient owners who expect fast learning from their dogs, and they are
reluctant to taking advice openly, however, others are relatively open to suggestions.
During your career in dog training you will be working with both types of dog handlers
and many other personality types too. So as you can see, a good dog trainer will not only
be working with dogs but with their owners and handlers too.

Dog training is not limited to “training” alone; there are also certain aspects that you
should be knowledgeable of, like the maintenance of proper dog hygiene, nutrition and
grooming.

Having a vast knowledge of what accessories to use and training aids that are available
will help during dog competitions. You will also need the ability to distinguish different
types of dog breeds and know what the fundamental differences are.

To be a good dog trainer it is not required to have a ’know it all’ mentality’ but basically
all you need to know is how to handle all types of dogs, work well with their handlers
and have sufficient knowledge on the basics of dog training.

Biting Dog Case Study
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 16, 2008


Sam is a three-year-old terrier mix that has a problem with biting. Other than biting the
other dog at home, an 8 year old Spaniel, Sam has the habit of a dog biting and
surprisingly snapping at his owners, Ted and Shelly. Both of them is concerned that
Sam’s biting behavior will cause problems and because of this they constantly make sure
that Sam won’t get near their grandkids for fear of their safety. However, keeping Sam in
a separate area of their home has only caused an increase in their problems; he has started
to chew and bark out of frustration, he gets easily agitated and always get a little out of
hand. Lastly, Ted and Shelly both decided that it is time to put a stop on Sam out of his
biting habit.



Since the dog has clearly outgrown the puppy stage that has the most amounts of biting
and gumming and the biting habit has been going on for a while , and Shelly sought the
help of a professional. Obtaining a referral from their family vet to an excellent
veterinarian behaviorist, Ted and Shelly made an appointment to bring Sam and meet
with the professional vet behaviorist. During the first meeting, Sam made an attempt to
bite Shelly when she pulled him out of his cage and snapped at the behaviorist when he
tried to hold him.



Since a medical problem might be the cause of the biting puppy situation, the behaviorist
felt the first step was to have Sam do a medical examination. They considered that a
medical reason may be the case because since Sam snapped at Shelly and the professional
when he attempted to touch the small dog. Often, dogs that are in pain or discomfort use
biting as a form of protection to stop the pain from occurring. But after a full medical
examination on Sam, he’s found to have a full bill.



The next thought was that Sam might be responding to a definite trigger. But since Shelly
and Ted adopted Sam when he was still a puppy, they can’t figure any possible abusive
background on their pet. To see how Sam interacts with them and their older dog, the
behaviorist repeatedly makes a visit to Shelly and Ted’s home. The visits proved to be
quite educational and the behaviorist was able to determine that Sam used biting to
showcase his jealousy. Especially since he was kept in a different part of the home and
avoided when the grandchildren come to visit, Sam is increasingly jealous and uses biting
to show his displeasure .



After the regular visits and examinations on the younger pet dog, a training plan is
implemented where Sam is instructed “no bite” and then sprayed with a water bottle. This
command enforces the training and the spritz gets the dog’s attention. Once Sam shuts his
mouth, he is remarkably praised. Additionally, more steps were made to include Sam
back into the home. Whenever the grandchildren come to visit, Sam is present, but he’ll
be securely muzzled until he became fully trained to stop biting. Once this training was
complete, Sam could be commanded and immediately close his mouth in order to abort
the biting attempt. However, Sam wore a muzzle whenever Shelly and Ted left the two
dogs alone and unsupervised, to prevent any injuries to the older dog.

Why Dogs Bark


Why do dogs bark? That’s easy: dogs bark because they are telling you something,
interacting with other dogs, or showing an emotion. Most likely, you’ve observed your
dog with another dog at some point and seen them interact. Dogs bark at each other when
they play or are just hanging out together. Sad to say but we are only able to guess the
cause for your dog’s barking behavior. The implication of their bark is easier to
understand when dogs communicate with humans. A simple way to understand barking as
it relates to human beings is to compare it to a crying baby.

Babies cry when they are hungry, gloomy, bored, lonesome, need to be changed, or sick.
When asking yourself, “Why do dogs bark?” the answer is just the same. A dog’s bark
will notify you when they want to go outside, when they would like a treat, when ready to
have their meal and when they’re feeling something. It’s understanding to decipher just
what that bark means that could take some time. Having your dog for quite a while,
you’ll start to appreciate of what the barking means much more clearly.

Why do dogs bark at nothing? The answer is they don’t. It may look like there is no
reason for barking profusely, but that is not always the case. When you think that your
dog is barking for no reason, begin to consider the possibilities. Is your dog in pain,
hungry, excited to go for a walk in the park or they have spotted someone outside your
home? We may not notice some of these smaller things going on around us, but your dog
will. If your dog is barking at the walls or at something non-existent, there is a possibility
of psychological or health reason fro the barking, so you may want to have your beloved
dog checked out by the vet .
Why dogs bark nonstop? To figure out the reason for barking, try observing your dog.
Most of the time, if you observe them, a dog will likely point their nose in the direction of
whatever it is they want while barking at the same time. If you notice that your pet is
barking nonstop and standing just beside the cupboard where you keep your doggie
biscuits, then you’ve just figured out what he or she wants! To figure out what a dog’s
bark is telling you, it’s up to each owner to pay close attention to their beloved pet, since
dogs normally show their behavior. Barking incessantly means that there is a need not
being met. In some situations, to control the behavior, regular exercise is a must, because
that need may not be met at all.

Why dogs bark when you are telling them not to do something? Not all dogs do this, but
if your dog does, you can probably relate it to a teenager talking back to a parent. How to
know if your dog is communicating back to you? You would hear them barking at you or
making noises when you. It’s their way of being disobedient towards you. To instruct
and train your pet that you are the boss to restrain this rebellious behavior, you should
definitely use some respect training.

Understanding why your dog barks is the key to controlling the behavior. Some barking
behavior is a lot easier to control by meeting their easy needs like feeding them, water, or
a walk outside. Nevertheless, barking behavior is a result of parting anxiety, fear, or
dominance needs to be curbed with exercises before it escalates into more aggressive or
detrimental behavior.

Dog Training:Aggressive Dog Behavior
Training your dog requires quite a bit of effort on your part. Your pup is totally dependent
on you to teach him to fit into your world snugly. The kind of guidance and leadership
you provide will determine the type of dog he will grow up to be. Therefore, you play an
important role in molding the character, behavior and temperament of your dog. That is
why it is important to train your dog well.

Not all dogs are created equal - some are born to lead while some gladly follows the
commands of the pack leader. Consequently, not all dogs respond to training in the same
manner - some gladly do their tasks and exercises without giving you, the owner, a hard
time while others will test your temperament to its limits. Hard-to-train dogs are by no
means the lesser beings as compared to their more subservient counterparts. On the
contrary, these dogs often possess several positive traits that interfere with your dog
training sessions. Two of the qualities that get in the way of dog training the most are the
animal’s independence and dominance. Let’s see how these qualities might jeopardize
your dog training efforts.Train your dog with best effort.

If you want hundred per cent attention from your dog, you must be prepared to give this
to him during training. He is entitled to your full attention - any failure on your part will
result in failure on his. Therefore, sessions should be short, but intensive whilst they last.
Voice Control - Probably the most important thing for a handler to learn is how to use his
or her voice to obtain the right response from the dog during training. Any sharpness used
to get his attention must be short and snappy with an immediate softening of tone
afterwards and with the recall an excited tone to encourage the dog to come in. A sharp
tone of voice should only be used to get the dog’s attention during training and at no
other time. If this sharpness of tone is not successful on this first call then your training is
not soundly based. Continual shouting is of little value in successful dog training.

-Body and Hand control - It can be of great value to use body and hand movements as
signals, but you must be conscious of their useful application. The proper and natural use
of signals will help your dog, so long as you know you are using them. You can later
minimise these signals or cut them out when no longer needed. Hand and arm signals in
particular can be used to reinforce acts of encouragement.

-Use of Food as Reward - Titbits of food should never be used in place of other forms of
reward or encouragement, but rather to back up or reinforce encouragement and praise.
The correct use of food can have a dramatic effect on the progress of training. To obtain
the best results in training, a dog should never be fed before a training session - it is much
easier to train a hungry dog. A training session just before feeding time where titbits are
used to reinforce praise and encouragement can prove to be very effective. It should be
noted that training without titbits can restrict the effectiveness of repeating that part of an
exercise to about three to five tries before moving to another part. After this, a dog
normally loses his edge and the handler wonders why performance deteriorates.
However, the use of titbits can prolong a training session for twenty to thirty repeats with
a hungry dog. The idea is to get the right balance and really understand your dog’s
limitations.

Dogs can be and are trained very effectively without ever using a titbit, but, as an aid, the
use of food can speed up and help consolidate on the elements being trained. Also, the
use of titbits can help to keep the handler in a better frame of mind. What handler can be
coarse and overbearing whilst giving his dog something to eat? It just would not make
sense.

Experts say that dog behaviors can be controlled through proper training. Dog training
behaviors are actually responses that are mostly triggered by environmental and social
factors. Your best bet would be to maximize training of your dog when it decides to bark.
Provide Adequate Food and Water - Provide food suited to your dog’s age size and
condition. Walk Your Dog - Your dog will let you know when it needs to be walked.

Dog Insurance Helps To Preserve Your Pets Health and
Your Budget
Although dog insurance is something that has been on the market for about two decades,
there are still many pet owners who are not aware that pet health insurance is available
and are even surprised to learn it is an option. However, because the pets are very often
considered a part of the family, learning about the availability of pet health insurance is
usually very good news to dog owners.

Anyone can relate to this sentiment of relief, if they have ever been faced with having to
either clean out their savings account or run up their credit card balance in order to take
care of an unexpected emergency. Having a pet plan can help to lighten the burden of the
expenses related to a surgical procedure, long-term care for serious conditions, such as
cancer and other types of diseases or emergency care due to injury or accident. Without
insurance, some dog owners are faced with the awful decision of having to put their pet
to sleep because the cost of proper health care is just too much for the family budget.

It is often a heartbreaking situation when a pet owner is faced with a choice of either
paying for expensive, but needed, veterinary pet procedures or being able to properly care
for the needs of the rest of the family in the household. This dilemma often results in the
agonizing decision of having to put the pet down. This is just the kind of situation that
illustrates the immense value, in emotional terms, of having dog insurance to assure the
well-being and the health needs of the family dogs.

Just as with other health care expenses, the costs associated with veterinarian care for
pets is also rising with each passing year. This fact has solidified the notion of acquiring
pet insurance to handle the animal welfare as well as health concerns a higher attractive
option. It has also made pet health insurance a more financially smart move for families.
Over the long haul is is far simpler to work a small insurance premium for dog health
insurance into the annual budget compared to trying to come up with many hundreds, or
possibly even thousands of dollar if an emergency happens.

If you own more than one dog, then insurance coverage for all of them makes even more
sense. Simply making certain that each seperate dog has gotton their vaccinations,
booster shots as well as health screening that are done on an annual basis can stretch a
persons budget to their breaking point. This situation can lead pet owners to decide to
skip the routine health care steps that should be taken to prevent illness and diseases.

In most cases, a comprehensive pet insurance policy will also cover wellness and
preventative care procedures. Fortunately, most the pet insurance company policies seem
to support the approach of taking preventive measures, with regard to animal welfare. It
is well-documented that taking preventative measures and supporting wellness care will
reduce the potential for serious health issues for the pet later down the road.

Because of this, searching out companies that provide insurance coverage which
incorporates preventative care is a wise course of action to take. The fact that a pet
insurance company offers such coverage speaks to their commitment and philosophy
about prevention of pet disease and the importance of animal welfare in general.
Preventative care coverage is the most expensive type of dog insurance that you can
purchase, but may not be in every families’ budget. In this case, it is often wise to opt for
a policy that will pay for major veterinary pet bills. This is an effective way to lower
monthly premium, but you will need to be prepared to handle the routine veterinarian
visits out of your own pocket. Finding a pet insurance company that offers policies that
cover wellness care is a positive sign and a good indicator about the kind of company
with whom you are dealing.

Couple Finds Homes For Retired War Dogs
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 14, 2008


Eight to 10 years is a full military career for dogs used by the Armed Services, but what happens when
those dogs are retired?

Ron Aiello, president of the U.S. War Dogs Association, said about 2,500 canines are active war dogs, with
about 700 of those serving in the Middle East. Aiello said upon retirement, some dogs are adopted by law
enforcement agencies and others are distributed to former handlers.

It is sometimes possible for civilians to adopt dogs that are considered not too aggressive by contacting the
military, and Aiello’s organization is trying tie up loose ends that could leave some dogs euthanized.

Dogs Brought Them - and Kept Them - Together
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 13, 2008


Dog-park rules are fairly straightforward: toys are shared, poop is scooped and one
doesn’t pry about life outside the fence. There, two-legged creatures are known by their
relationship to four-legged ones, as in “That’s Miko’s dad” or “That’s Gracie’s mom.”
Which is how John Forte, now 44 (Miko’s dad and a software engineer at Sun
Microsystems) and Christine Beirne, 40 (Gracie’s mom, a former teacher, and now a
“salary-deferring parent”), first knew each other at the Redwood Shores dog run in 2000.

Dog Life Jackets
Dog Life Jackets

If you love to take your dog with you everywhere you go, then you may want to purchase
a dog life jacket. People who enjoy boating and want to take their dog with them should
seriously consider purchasing a water life jacket for their dog. For many a dog owner,
their beloved pet is treated just like one of the family. You would never let your small
child near deep water without a life jacket on, and then the same should be said for your
dog wearing a life jacket too.

A dog life jacket is a waterproof coat made especially for dogs that will allow him to
easily move around enough to swim or partake in any number of other fun water
activities that you have planned for the day. Another advantage to having a dog life jacket
is the handle made on the back side which will allow you to pull him out of the water
quickly if needed.

A life jacket for your dog could very well save his or her life, and I would recommend
that all dogs wear one when at the beach, lake or near deep water. Many dogs become
distracted easily and this can create problems if they are on a boat or even a wharf, pier or
jetty. It is very easy for a dog to be distracted by a bird or a bright object like a
windsurfer, possibly causing them to fall off your boat or the dockside. If he or she is
wearing a life jacket you will have the peace of knowing that he will be able to remain
afloat until you can rescue him or he can swim back to the boat or shore.

Dogs also have a tendency to get excited and overdo it when they are playing in the
water. Unfortunately, dogs have been known to drown when playing in water with a toy,
ball or stick. They can get too tired without noticing it because they are keenly focused on
playing with you or the toy. A tired dog can very easily fall victim to a strong current or a
rip tide.

That is why a dog life jacket is very important, it is not dumb to want to keep your dog
alive by having them wear one, because it will greatly increase their chances of survival
if they are in danger due to deep water or strong currents. You can get a good dog life
jacket by searching the internet for such items or you can even order one special from
your local pet store if they do not already carry them in stock. Dog life jackets are
available in sizes to fit all dogs.

Bird Dog Training
Popular Commands for Dog Training One of the first commands to teach your dog is to
“Come”. Then you can teach your dog to “Heel” upon command.
People are amazed at watching a well trained bird dog in action. These finely trained bird
dogs never fail to heed their owners’ commands. When you see them perform you may
begin to ask yourself, how did they do that? Perhaps bird dog training can bring out the
best in you dog.

Training them to be a bird dog will bring out the best in your dog if you are willing to
work consistently with them.

There are some breeds that have a natural lineage, giving them the ability to becoming a
good bird dog. Teaching them to obey basic commands is the best place to start.
Professional dog trainers know how very important it is for dogs to understand what it is
their owner wants from them. For this basic voice command training, there are basic
words a owner should use to train the dog.

First is for them to learn the “Stay” command.

The most basic command is “Stay”

Dogs that follow their masters command without hesitation will demonstrate obedience
and respect to his owner. Complete obedience is shown by obeying the command no
matter how far the distance is between the giver of the command and the dog.

The ’Whoa’ or ’Easy’ command is useful for dogs that are going too far ahead, when the
dog is flushing the bird and the owner wants him to stop, or when the dog wants to play
with the bird. When this happens it is easier for the owner to come to the dog and reward
him for a job well done.

Teaching them to ’Come’

This command simply suggests that the dog should approach you as commanded. The
uses of this command are rather simple. A good reason to teach them to come, would be
that when retrieving something, they bring it back to you when instructed to do so. Also,
there are dogs that are a bit stubborn and may decide to go off in different directions.
Giving this command will help cut down on the distance between you and your dog in
case he decides to do things his way.

The ’Heel ’Command

Teaching your dog to respond to the Heel command, is used when wanting them to walk
by your side.

Another command that is often used after the ’Heel’ command is the one word command
’Ok’ or to ’Go’. By using this command your dog will know they did a good job during
the hunt and you are pleased with them.
Whenever the dog performs well, never fail to give him a tap, a treat or a word of praise
to acknowledge his performance. Fine dogs are born with the instinct to please their
owners. If you can let your dog see that he is pleasing you with his performance and you
want him to repeat it, the best thing you can do is to reward him. Over a period of time,
he will learn to do the same actions for which he was rewarded and praised.

Bird dog training is not easy. It is because of this, there are few well trained bird dogs
today. Always be confident that your dog can become a fine hunter if you do what it takes
to make him successful, by showing him patience in teaching him to obey basic
commands.

Have you thought about bringing home a former
Greyhound racer?
Greyhounds are beautiful animal racers. As they work and perform throughout their
profesional careers, they normally work until they are between 1.5 and 4 years old.
Throughout this time, they become adjusted to being walked and lead on a leash, so upon
retirement from their racing careers, they make gentle pets!

As a former athlete, they are smart, quiet, calm, clean, gentle, and generally good-natured
and happy to adapt to a new home life. They react well to positive attention and
reinforcement and so they are a pleasure to train and work with for the new families they
become a part of.

They love affection and although they do want exercise, they do not need as much space
to run as people might think. Inside the home, they prefer to curl up in a corner on a soft
blanket. They are gentle creatures and very well behaved inside a house and around
people.

Greyhounds spend most of their life with other dogs, trainers, and handlers, so they are
very sociable animals and get along well with others. Their temperament makes them an
wonderful breed to be near children. Their intelligence and devotion make them an
perfect companion. And since they are well mannered, they are great around company
and in public.

There is probably a local Greyhound Pets of America club near you. So think about
adopting a former Greyhound athlete. For more information, check out the Tucson
Greyhound Park. Various clubs have different expectations and costs, but all will
encourage you to come visit and find out more about whether a Greyhound might be right
for you!

Please help by volunteering your time. All local clubs need volunteers to help with
supplies, veterinary appointments, or even just shopping for doggie supplies. Of course,
financial donations are also needed, but your time and love is needed most!

Wood Dog House – What Type Of Materials To Use For
Your Doghouse?
Although wood dog houses are common among many families who own dogs, not many
people know there are many different types of wood available for your dog house.

The most common type of wood used is cedar. It is one of the most popular choices for
wooden dog houses because of its resistance to decay and as well as insect and rot
resistance.

Cedar is easy to work with and it is durable and reliable and can be work for long periods
of time without any maintenance.

Other types of wood that are used in building dog houses include pine and hemlock
though they are less common. One reason is because they lack the insect and decay
resistance compared to cedar wood. That is also why they are seldom used as the base
structure of your dog house as they decay and rot faster especially when they come into
contact with the ground.

If you are building your own dog house, beware of using pressure-treated wood. This is
because although they are resistant to decay and insects, they contain harmful chemicals
that could pose a danger to your dog.

Most older pressure treated wood uses chromated copper arsenate which can be deadly to
animals. Nevertheless, over the past few years, other chemicals have been used to create
pressure treated wood and it is safer.

Wood is also better than plastic in building dog houses because they stay much warmer
during the winter. Wood also helps to dissipate heat naturally during the summer months.

Wood is also easier to work with compared to plastic. You only need a saw and a hammer
to build your own dog house. If you are eco-conscious, then building wooden dog houses
is also more environmentally friendly and can easily be recycled for other purposes. It is
also cheaper than plastic.

houses.

Getting a Pet Insurance Comparison Gives The Right
Choices For Your Needs
                          Do's and donts of pet health insurance

For many people who own and love pets, there is just nothing worse than worrying about
not being able to afford the cost of taking proper care of them. If you have been thinking
that it is time to look into purchasing veterinarian insurance for pets, then you most likely
will want to take some time to do a pet insurance comparison.

In more recent years, getting pet insurance to provide for the dogs, cats and various other
members of your extended family has practically become a must-have item, particularly
for homes that have more than one pet. As the vet bill increase, it makes good sense to
invest in pet health insurance, similar to as you would do for the human people within
your home. Such pet health insurance can make very good economic sense, but it is
important to conduct a comparison before purchasing animal care insurance.

You will find that there are many companies today that offer pet health insurance
coverage. Doing a pet insurance comparison can be very beneficial in helping you to sort
through and find the best type of coverage for your family pets and the best cost for the
premiums. One of the most efficient ways of making such comparisons is by going online
and checking the various offerings of the different pet insurance companies.

There are even some websites on the internet that will assist you to complete your
comparison, doing this through a side-by-side listing of the various of pet insurance so
that you can rapidly compare the various policies as well as the companies. This is a great
time saver and can help you quickly eliminate pet insurance company offerings or a pet
plan that does not offer what you need most. Once you have identified the plan that will
provide the type of coverage you want, then it is easier to make the comparisons.

When doing an insurance comparison, some of the things you will want to consider and
perhaps even seek out additional information about are: whether the plan includes
coverage for kennel fees; whether you can take your pet to any licensed veterinarian or if
you must choose from a list of approved animal care professionals; if the plan covers
wellness or preventative care benefits; whether the plan covers boarding fees in the event
that you become ill and cannot care for your pet yourself and if you need to find a plan
that will also extend coverage to related events such as being reimbursed for cancellation
fees associated with travel. These are simply some of the numerous things to consider
that need to be taken into consideration when coming to a conclusion on veterinary pet
insurance plans to meet your particular needs.

In addition to these concerns, there are also a number of things that should be looked at
with regard to each pet insurance company. When doing a comparison for insurance, you
need to know the answers to, at the very least, these types of questions when it comes to
the different companies; what length of time have they been in the pet insurance
industry? Is the pet insurance company stable and does it have a good reputation? Has
your veterinarian had any dealings with the company and have those dealings been
positive? Does the pet insurance company employ ony licensed or certified professional
for key positions?
While it can be tempting to buy cheap pet insurance, doing a careful pet insurance
comparison can help you to learn more specifics about the different coverage options of
the various policies and also about the reputation of the various pet insurance companies.
In the long run, being sure that you have the right coverage which will be the most
beneficial to your beloved pets and will meet the needs of you and your family, will be
more important than saving a few dollars a month in the short term.

Types of Dog Aggression Behaviors


Anually , while only a small percentage of people are bitten by dogs, there are a lot of
unacceptable other types of aggressive dog behavior. But occasionally, aggressive
behavior can be obvious signs of aggression, but it is more passive for other types of
violent behavior. Whether you observe their behavior as a more passive-aggressive or just
a total danger, they are still behaviors that can escalate or cause problems in your home or
people around you.



First, it is important to note that the types of violent behavior of dogs are not familiar in
any other breed over another. We also need to know how to handle an aggressive dog.
Only about 1 percent in every breed of dogs shows signs of violent behavior. It is just
definite, in certain breeds of dog; more volatile types of aggressive behavior appear to
make the news more often, and for that reason, we assume it is common. Hence, it is vital
to keep in mind that any dog exhibiting signs of violent dog behavior need to be taught
out those manners.



There are specific types of aggressive dog behavior that occur for a variety of reasons.
Generally, symptoms of outward aggression are growling, snarling, curling lips, and
biting. Just because they are to be the most threatening qualities more people talk about
the variations of aggressive behavior. Traits of aggression in dogs can also be like
mounting people, lunging, blocking your way and barking. But dog owners tend to
dismiss these as peculiar traits because they think that its actions are not as directly
aggressive towards humans.



 Though these types of violent behavior occur mainly depends on what the root causes
are . There are a least number of reasons for this kind of behavior. When your pet is
trying to create dominance it will usually do a lot of jumping, lunging, blocking or
mounting actions on you. Dogs are pack animals, so they will most of the time try to
exhibit supremacy over small kids by “herding them” which might involve small nips at
their ankle, while male dogs may try to create dominance to mount members of the
family. It is essential when you observe these kinds of violent dog behavior to establish
that you really the ‘alpha dog’ by taking control of things and situations.



A basis for hostile dog behavior is FEAR. Generally, a dog may put its tail between its
legs, pull its ears back and look away or even run when he’s frightened. Although if a dog
feels ensnared, it may lash out with growling, snarling, and even biting. It is essential for
your dog to feel secured, but there are a lot of methods to condition your dog to lower a
fear response.



Facts like these, we can single-out ideas on how to handle an aggressive dog. This kind of
aggressive dog behavior might be observed if your dog is feeling territorial or possessive.
Dogs often have a sense of territory that they do not like to share their most possessed
treasures and if closely observed, the same thing goes for humans. Also, a lot of
aggressive behaviors may occur if your dogs feel that their territory is being violated or
even when a family member is in danger. It is important to terminate this kind of manner
by taking precautionary actions and avoiding these potentially dangerous situations. For
example, if your beloved is aggressive only when he or she eats, then you need to keep
people away from his/her saucer during feeding times. You also need to institute that you
are the boss over the food.



When dogs face fear or territorial breaches, when they cannot take their aggression out on
the thing causing their fear, dogs sometimes turn their aggression toward something or
someone else. This is called redirected aggression. Again, this behavior needs to be
discouraged. Keep in mind though that discipline may be ok, but punishment is not.
Samples of situations that encourage dogs to act violently are punishments that are
imposed to them.



What might be the causes behind these types of violence , it is significant to put off your
dog from showing the behaviors. Allocate time to train your dog, which seldom needs a
lot of patience and time, so that you keep your dog nourished, happy, and secure.

Prevent Your Dog From Chewing


Do you have a dog chewing problem ? A dog that loves to chew on anything he sees
interesting and you can’t seem to figure out why he has this kind of passion? Did you
ever come home from work and found your newest pair of shoes being chewed upon by
your, cute, sweet and innocent, little dog? If this is a familiar scenario to you, I suggest
that you continue to read on.



One of the worst habits that any dog can pick up is chewing. Besides it being destructive
to your property, a a dog chewing might end up injuring itself by breaking its teeth or
swallowing harmful material. Moreover, , some dogs gnaw on themselves! This kind of
bad habit may cause hair loss and even serious infections to areas of their bodies like
their tails, legs, and feet. If you have a problem with dog chewing, instead of dismissing
the act as a typical dog behavior, work to immediately correct the situation.



Chewing is a known behavior of puppies . However, their choices of what to chew on
will be directly dependent upon you . If you are welcoming a new puppy into your home,
be sure to supply it with adequate toys to prevent your pooch from destroying your home,
car, or wardrobe. In addition , be sure to choose toys that cannot be mistaken for those
“out of bound” items. To somehow redirect its attention from the new pair they have just
bought, many dog owners prefer to grant their pups with cast off shoes but to their
surprise the puppy would still chew up on their brand new pair instead. Look for chewing
toys and bones that will not splinter, break, or split and potentially cause a choking
hazard. So that your dog does not become bored and opt to chew on your beloved
possessions and furniture as an alternative, give your puppy with several different toys in
various areas.



Yes, there are simple steps that can help you prevent your dog from chewing up your
possessions! For starters, the easiest way to stop this routine is to keep an eye on your
dog. Dogs cannot chew up your house and home while you sit watching them. A huge
part of dog ownership is VIGILANCE. Furthermore, consider confining your dog to a
room or area of your home until you can trust him to have free rein of your abode. More
than vigilance , cleanliness is a large factor in what a dog has access to chew. Simply put,
your dog cannot chew your shoes unless they were left accessible. If you find your dog
chewing something, if possible, place it out of his reach. In all likelihood , the dog will
continue chewing the same item until it is either removed or completely destroyed.
“But what about the larger things like furniture, doors, or appliances that will be hard to
move”, you say? For these structures, apply a thin film of Bitter Apple. Like its name
suggests, this solution is quite bitter and very unsavory for dogs. Available in a spray or
cream, Bitter Apple will not damage the finish of your furniture and can easily be wiped
away once the dog learns not the chew. Don’t be alarmed if your dog does ingest the
material, it will not make him sick, as the contents of it are non-toxic.



Lastly, be the protector of your own things. Teach your dog commands like “leave it” and
instruct him to cease and desist the gnawing of your items. Use a spray bottle or a shaker
device rather than physical punishment, which can sometime cause dogs to become more
destructive in protest. If your dog is chewing on himself more than your home,
immediately visit your veterinarian. There are a lot of skin conditions, including parasitic
infections that can cause a dog to chew on his own skin in order to find relief. Turn to a
cooling spray that will provide relief as the area begins to heal. Also, use an antibiotic
cream to prevent infection.

Dog Food Secrets – Are Commercial Dog Food Safe?
Ultimately, one will realize that manufactured canned dog foods are not the best for dogs.
Although there are many substantial claims that the formulas used for these dog foods are
scientifically tested to meet the required dietary allowance of our beloved pets, one would
have to consider that dogs of the ancient times never really had science to back up their
diet. With their raw diet of whatever they were given by their masters before, they still
managed to survive,

Many people are growing concerned about the commercial dog foods that keep on
popping out of store shelves. This includes kibbles, treats, wet dog foods and dry dog
foods. So many dog foods of different kinds have been released and there were also
product recalls. But really, what is the best food for your dog?

In reality, the best food for your dog is all natural dog food. Dogs are not really
scavengers but they can survive on scraps of bread and meat or even vegetables if they
have no choice. In reality, the best food for every dog is freshly prepared natural dog food
such as chicken, rice, bread and vegetables. This is something that any person in any
household can prepare. The most important thing is that the food is clean and free from
harmful chemicals that human beings eat.

There are a lot of human foods out there that can be lethal to dogs and other animals. One
of these is chocolate. It is also important to know you should not add seasonings such as
salt, pepper and sugar to your dog food.
If you want your dog to be healthy, you have to prepare its food yourself. You can use
boiled meat or bones so the dog has something to chew. Rice is also healthy for dogs so
they have carbohydrates to burn.

If you want to learn what are the best food for your dog, i recommend you read my dog
food secrets review and learn why commercial dog food is dangerous for your dog.

Condo Living with Dogs Can Be Great, If You’re Up To
It
Condos are becoming kennels. I exaggerate only slightly that some days it appears there
are as many dogs living in my building as there are people. And I confess, I’m part of the
reason condos are going to the dogs. My partner and I own two: Sally, a 20-pound
cockapoo, and Watson, a seven-pound rescue–he’s a poodle variant of some sort.

We have a small apartment with Sally and Watson’s houses (a. k. a. crates). Dog houses
dominating your living room doesn’t make it elegant. The easy-to-wash blanket on the
sofa is not exactly chic, either.

Learning About Poodle Puppies
Poodle puppies are cute, cuddly, and curly and definitely a pet anyone would want to take
home. Poodles make great pets, and have the most fun with them you will need to know
as much about poodle puppies so that they are comfortable when you take them home, so
read on to see what you should know in order to be a responsible poodle owner.
No matter which poodle breed you decide to purchase, you should know that some
poodles tend to be a little reclusive or anti-social, and aren’t very friendly around
strangers - unless they are trained. You will need to socialize your poodle puppies by
placing them in an environment where people will be present often, so that it won’t be so
overwhelming for the dogs when you have people over or take the puppies on an outing.

You should also make sure that you take your poodle puppies to the vet often for
checkups, since poodles tend to have vision problems fairly often. Your poodle’s eyes
should be alert and shiny, and if you start to notice a film around the eyes, or if you see
that your puppy’s eyes are running often, this could be a sign of cataracts. Treating this
condition in the early stages is key, so be sure to tell the vet if you notice that your dog’s
vision is a little cloudy. Poodle puppies are also prone to ear infections, as are most other
poodles, so be sure to have your puppy’s ears checked at the vet as well; hearing tests, as
well as medication may need to be administered, and you should ask your animal doctor
about dosages for your puppy as well.

You may also notice that your poodle has very sensitive skin, and that certain grooming
products should not be used on your poodle puppies. Poodle owners are often dying their
dog’s hair in a variety of colors, or shampooing the thick fur of the poodle with expensive
shampoos that come in a variety of scents. However, the chemicals in some of these
cleaning agents could be harmful to your poodle puppies, and could cause rashes and skin
irritations. Your puppy could also develop an allergy to these products, so if you notice
that your dog is more sluggish than usual, or is sneezing often, you should let your
grooming professional know, or shampoo your poodle at home.

Outdoor Dog Houses – Build Your Own Doghouse Or
Buy Pre-Built Dog House
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 7, 2008


Today, you can find many types of outdoor doghouses available in pet stores such as
wooden doghouses, cedar wood doghouses and even igloo dog houses with heaters.

If you have a large sized dog, it would be best to keep it outdoors. However, before you
do that, you need a shelter for your dog. Dog houses protect your pet from the wind, sun
and cold winters. What type of doghouse you need depends a lot on your needs and your
budget, so do a bit of thinking before buying one.

Traditionally, most doghouses come with a triangular roof which looks like a small hut.
The most common material used is mostly wood which is practical although nowadays,
you can choose different types of wood for your dog house such as cedarwood.
If you decide on building your own outdoor doghouse, I found several simple dog house
plans online that are practical and shouldn´t require too much time and money.
Alternatively, you can visit the bookstore or Amazon to buy doghouse plans.

However, most people would prefer to buy pre-built wooden doghouses since it takes
some time to build one yourself. Most pet retailers carry dog houses that are made from
different materials such as plastic or foam.

Petco also sells high tech doghouses which provide insulation from cold winters as well
as dog house air conditioners to keep your pet cool during the summer months. Of course
the price is in the high range.

Since dogs are social animals and loved to be near their owners, it would be best to place
your doghouse at the front or at the side of your house rather than at the back. If not, you
might find your dog not wanting to sleep in the doghouse.

Also, make sure to keep the areas surrounding the doghouse clean. Nobody likes to sleep
in a dirty home and that includes your dog as well.

Visit my wooden dog house site for more information on where to buy cheap cedar dog
houses.

What to Know for Breeding Labradors
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 7, 2008


There are some things you should know if you are interested in breeding Labradors.
Especially if you want to breed labradors for a dog show. The goal of breeding Labradors,
or any dog, is for the puppy to have the ideal characteristics for which you are looking.
However, you won’t know which dogs to breed if you do not know which characteristics
are most favorable in Labrador dogs. Learning these traits will help you to be a successful
breeder of Labradors. It could make all the difference in winning that first place ribbon
at any dog show.

There are certain variations of the Labrador breed that would be actually be penalized in
a dog show. For instance, the Labrador retriever could be one. The retriever is a medium-
sized dog with a short coat, small ears, and a short thick tail and is not considered “show”
qualities. Likewise are the weedy, light dogs, the leggy, tall dogs, the low-stationed, long
dogs, and the lumbering, cloddy dogs. These will all earn penalties in the dog shows as
they are contradictory to the proportionate and sturdy build of the ideal Labrador.

Certain anatomical characteristics are important when breeding Labradors. Ideally, the
Labrador’s head should include a broad snout, clean cheeks, powerful muzzle, and, white
teeth.The dog's nose color can be varied, just like the dog's color. The nostrils should be
wide and open. The eyes should be a slightly triangular-shape and have a kind
expression. Finally, the ears should be short and be triangular in shape and should drop.

The key to breeding Labradors is to look for a favorable temperament. This will impress
any judge at the dog shows. Labrador retrievers are eager to please and they are also very
outgoing and friendly animals. Labradors are also quite intelligent. Judges look for these
characteristics when evaluating Labradors in a dog show.

Labradors can be black, chocolate, or yellow. Yellow dogs may vary in shade, and some
labs may have a white spot on the chest, though this is not preferred. You might be please
to note that the Judges do not give any penalties if a Labrador has white hairs due to
aging and scarring.

Judges look for Labradors who are bred to be a specific height and weight. They are
looking to see that the height and weight is typical of Labradors. For male Labradors, the
typical height is twenty-two and one-half inches to twenty-four and one-half inches. Male
dogs should weigh between sixty-five and eighty pounds. For female Labradors, the
typical height is between twenty-one and one-half and twenty-three and one-half inches.
The ideal weight for female dogs is fifty-five to seventy pounds.

It is important to be aware of dog show criteria when you are breeding Labradors. You
want to be able to breed certain characteristics and traits for the best results. Breeding
Labradors can be a challenge, but it can be very rewarding if you are successful and
achieve your goals.

Dog Obedience Training and Three Basic Rules
Owning a dog without attention to the importance of dog training is not very responsible.
Fortunately, there are some basic principles that can make the job easier.

Dog obedience training requires the use of some principles which differentiate effective
training from training without results. Most dog training and dog behavior schools use
these rules. These are:

Principle One:The first rule in obedience training is to be consistent. You must be
consistent in the use of words, the tone of your voice and your actions, that go with your
command. At the beginning of training you as the dog owner or trainer must make the
decision as to what guidelines you will use to teach the dog. A word or a phrase, let’s say
‘come’, does not make sense to a dog. Your dog does not understand our language, nor
does he understand or think, the way we do.

For the training to be understandable, the command must be used in a consistent manner
so he can recognize the meaning to the word and tone. If you are using the word ‘come’
make sure everyone is. The command ‘Come’ specifically means that the dog should
approach the giver of the command and use it in that sense. If he does not come to you,
do not force the dog to come to you and punish him for doing so. This would make him
attribute the command with the punishment.

Then what would you expect?-If the command leads to punishment he will not follow it
next time. The same command used, by all people, must be consistent. For example, if
you are using the command ‘come’, other people in the household should not replace it
with words like ‘here’ or ‘come here boy’.

Principle Two:The hours devoted to training and the words used as command should be
kept short. Keep in mind that the attention span of dogs (and especially a puppy) is very
short that making them engrossed with a specific activity would be very hard, if not
impossible. Combining children with your puppy obedience training is an example of
keeping your training sessions short as they would lose interest very quickly, so it is best
to move on to the next thing.

Your dog becomes easily bored and their interest at the beginning soon fades. The same
thing happens in training therefore, it should be limited only to 10 minutes to 15 minutes
of regular training.

Principle Three: Never hurt the dog if you want him to be trained, through force or
punishment. Also, never force the dog to follow the command if he is not prepared for it
or punish a dog for something he did. Don’t push the animal too hard while training.

The dog does not understand that he should learn things instantly and he does not realize
that you are becoming impatient with the speed he is picking up the training. He only
knows you are angry. So do not use force as this does not communicate your meaning
properly, instead use negative reinforcement. Do not send him mixed signals, by making
him feel praised for doing something wrong, only when he obeys the command, should
he feel praised.

You have to be understanding and patient, especially during your dog obedience training
sessions. The outcome will be a very responsive and well trained dog.

Need To Potty Train Your Puppy?
You may have just recently purchased a new puppy. He is so adorable! Beside enjoying
your little pal, you also want to protect your home so your furnishings and carpets aren’t
ruined. What should you do now?

One of your first jobs is to teach your puppy where to relieve himself so your home won’t
be damaged. How can that be accomplished?

Grab your free dog training course and learn more about how to house puppy train.
Dogs act mainly from habits that have been developed over a period of time and that fact
can help you as a dog owner. As the dog owner, you need to install the habits of your
choice. Don’t let your pet create his own habits that you might not appreciate. Your
puppy has limitations that you need to be aware of. Since your puppy’s bladder is so
small, he can’t hold his urine in very long. Understanding and patience will help you deal
with your puppy’s limitations.

Don’t scream at your puppy when he has an accident. Training your new pal requires
patience. If your puppy has an accident on the living room carpet, be gentle with him.
Tell him “no” in a gentle way. Then pick him up and place him where you do want him to
go potty. Then tell him to go potty in that place in your own words.

Dogs don’t want to soil their beds, so if you use a crate for him to sleep in, that will help
your puppy potty training efforts. Playpens can also be used for training purposes.

There are times when your new puppy is more likely to go potty. First thing in the
morning is one of the times when your puppy will need to relieve himself. Right after
eating is one of the main times your new puppy will want to relieve himself. Be sure to
take your puppy to his designated toilet area before he goes to bed at night. Right after
romping around for a while, your pal will probably want to go potty.

Your new pet needs close supervision. If he goes potty on his own outside, be sure to
praise him immediately. If he should go potty inside the house, you need to gently but
sternly let him know that isn’t the right place to go. Be sure to praise your puppy when he
does go in the correct place. He really needs your approval.

You can learn the signs that your puppy is about to go potty. Wandering off, sniffing and
circling are signs that your puppy is ready to relieve himself. Maybe he’ll go and stand at
the door.

Patience and kindness goes a long way in dog training. Be sure to spend time training
your new pal to urinate or deficate where you have chosen for him to go. The time and
effort you put into training your new pal will be worth it when he knows the right time
and place to relieve himself.

Helping Your Dog When It Has Had A Stroke
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 7, 2008
It may come as a shock to you to find out that your dog has suffered from a stroke.
Unlike humans, when a dog has a stroke, he often won’t become paralyzed or display any
of the human signs of stroke. In fact, with the right care and attention, chances are he will
bounce right back within a short period after suffering from a stroke, especially if he has
a little help.

How To Tell Your Dog Has Had A Stroke?
Often, there are a few signs that will tell you that your dog is suffering from a stroke.
These usually include loss of sight, falling over, and tilting and turning of the head. If you
notice your dog displaying these symptoms, you should take him to the vet to rule out
other serious health problems such as brain disease, which may be the underlying cause
of the symptoms.

Often, pet owners are not aware that their dog has suffered from a stroke. If your pet is
advanced in years, seems off color, or acting strangely, he may have suffered a stroke.
The best way to find out for sure is to take him to the vet for an examination. Once there,
the vet will put your dog under anesthesia, and run some tests to find out what is causing
your dog to act strangely.

My Dog Has Had A Stroke, What Should I Do?
If your dog has had a stroke, it is important to remember that dogs don’t suffer as badly
from strokes as humans do, and they will recover faster than humans. Once your dog has
had a stroke, there is not a lot that your vet can do for him. In most cases, there is no
magical cure, or special pill, all your vet will do is confirm that it was a stroke, and rule
out the dangerous diseases that may be causing your dog to suffer from the strokes.

However, there are some things that you, the owner of your dog, can do to help with his
recovery. Because you share a close owner-pet bond, your dog will recover faster if you
are around to care for him, and cheer him on as he starts getting better. Make sure that he
has a warm cozy place to rest, and plenty of encouragement, and love from you, to
remind him of why he wants to get better.

You may also need to encourage your pet to eat, and drink soon after he has suffered from
a stroke, and help him onto his feet, and encourage him to take bathroom breaks outside.
Exercise, especially strenuous exercise, should be avoided. Once your dog is feeling well
enough, he will soon tell you when he is ready to start going on walks again. After a
matter of weeks, he will be starting to get back to his old self.

Don’t forget that once your dog has recovered, he will still need plenty of love, and
encouragement, and may not be as agile as he was before the stroke. Strokes can keep
reoccurring in dogs, so keep a close eye on him.

Case Study of a Barking Dog
Teacup, a two-year-old mixed breed dog, keeps barking whenever her owner Tom is
away at work. Tom recently transferred into a new house with a spacious fenced-in
backyard. At this time, as Teacup would normally do while Tom is away, she would not
stop from barking. The barking dog progressed so badly that neighbors in his apartment
building regularly complained, forcing Tom to find a new place of his own. However,
Teacup continues to bark and Tom is worried about the complaints of his new neighbors.
Teacup does not bark while Tom is home, so he must look for a way to stop the dog
barking while he is at work.

Ever since Tom transferred , he pointed out hindrance from an outside source causing
Teacup to become aggravated and to bark. With Teacup’s current condition , frustration is
not an option, Tom has spoken to his neighbors and no person or animal provokes Teacup
from over her fence. Furthermore , since the change of atmosphere has changed the
placement of things, Tom can be sure there is nothing that would cause Teacup to bark.
And, Teacup’s food dish. Water bucket, and toys are all well within the dog’s reach.

Tom then brought Teacup to his veterinarian’s clinic and ruled out any medical conditions
that may cause Teacup to bark. Since Tom is always away from home every morning
when he was still in his previous home, Teacup’s veterinarian suggest that Tom look at
the idea of boredom barking. Since the odd seems to make sense, Tom starts looking into
his idea of keeping Teacup entertained during the day.

At the beginning, Tom calls a local pet sitting business that specializes in taking care of
dogs during the day while their owners are at work. The people in this business were very
professional and a schedule was made up that they would visit Teacup twice a day for
one-half hour at a time. During Teacup’s visitation, a person would walk the dog around
the park and plays with her most of the time. Though Teacup did not bark as much before
and this situation worked out well, the dog still barked.

Tom decided to enroll Teacup in the “doggy daycare” provided by a local kennel to stop
the incessant barking dog. Basically, this class acts as a dog version of conventional
daycare and to prevent boredom, the employees let the dogs play together. Tom drops
Teacup off on the dog daycare center on his way to the office and picks her up on the way
home. This setup makes the dog and the owner happy, it works perfectly well for both
Teacup and Tom. Even though the fees for the “doggy daycare” are more than leaving
Teacup at home during the day or even hiring a dog sitter, Tom feels the amount is well
acceptable when he sees how happy Teacup is at the end of the day and the reality that his
neighbor’s complaints have ceased. Moreover, since Teacup was otherwise an only dog,
this “doggy daycare” lets her to mingle with other dogs, ensuring she is well developed
socially and emotionally.

Natural Pet Allergy Treatment Options Are Simple And
Effective
Even though you may have a deep love for animals; after coming into contact with them,
sometimes you could develop pet allergies. Developing pet allergies even after having
kept pets for several years is also common for some people. The sad part is that your love
for animals can be put to severe test if you develop pet allergy and this allergy in turn will
make you suffer from ill health. Itchiness in the skin, wheezing, as well as having eyes
that water constantly are some of the common symptoms of pet allergies.

Part With Your Pet

If pet allergy treatment does not work in controlling symptoms of your pet allergy you
may even be forced into parting with your pet. However, some people are so fond of their
pets that they will not contemplate giving away their pets. A solution for such people is to
ensure reducing dander in the home and to also remove allergens in the home so that the
chances of developing pet allergy are greatly reduced.

There are however a few simple natural pet allergy treatment options worth trying out.
For one, you need to ensure that your pet is not allowed anywhere near your sleeping area
and to also ensure that the pet is not allowed on to your furniture. These are relatively
simple natural pet allergy treatment options and should be followed strictly to prevent pet
allergy from affecting you.

Another natural pet allergy treatment option is to bathe the pet every week and when
brushing the pet to remember and do so outside of the house and on a daily basis as well.
Reducing the quantity of dander that the pet carries within the home will take place using
these measures. Converting your pet into an outside pet and not letting him stay indoors
with you is another simple natural pet allergy treatment option.

You will also need to vacuum your carpets on a daily basis and also damp out dust at least
once in a week. Other than this, you need to ensure washing your hands with a good soap
each time you have played with or touched your pet. Other simple pet allergy treatments
include installing air purifier in the home which will remove pet dander from the air and
to have wooden floors instead of carpeting the floors which will only trap the allergens
and that will mean increasing the risk of pet allergies.

To prevent and treat this condition requires learning about effective allergy asthma
treatment such as becoming physically active and playing sports and games, allergy
asthma is very often noticed among children and also in young adults.
Another pet allergy treatment option to consider is choosing an allergy friendly pet.
Known to carry fewer quantities of dander and so will therefore pose less of a threat in
regard to risk of pet allergy, which means that small birds as well as small dogs are
known to carry fewer quantities of dander.

Cedar Dog Houses – Find Cedar Doghouse Plans Or
Buy Pre-built Doghouse
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 5, 2008


I’m not sure whether dogs like cedar dog houses but most doghouses are made of wood.
Small dogs usually live indoors so there is no need to buy a doghouse. However, larger
sized dogs will need their own place and most families usually put their dogs outside,
therefore a wooden doghouse is needed.

Finding a large doghouse that can accommodate their dogs is often a problem. You can
get find cedar doghouse plans online and construct your own doghouse. That way, you
can customized the dog house to whatever you want.

However, if you want to save the hassle, you can always buy a cedar doghouse online or
get someone to build it for you. Where To Put The Dog House Most people usually place
their doghouse at the rear of the house.

It is not a very good spot because not only is it inconvenient for you, most dogs don’t like
to be located far from people. Dogs are sociable animals and prefer places where people
congregate. Therefore, it is best to place your doghouse at the side of your house or the
front porch.

If possible, the cedar doghouse should be lifted up off the ground with small blocks
neighbouring the foundation. This provides a pocket of airspace that can help in
insulation. To keep the doghouse warm in winter, you need to have a flap in front of the
doghouse.

Regular maintenance is essential and it is important to keep the area around the doghouse
clean. If not, you will find your dog not wanting to sleep in the doghouse. If you can
build a dog runway, that would be ideal and it allows your dog to run and still be
restrained at the same time.

Whether you choose to build your own doghouse or buy existing pre-built doghouses, be
sure that your dog can live and move comfortably inside it.

Help For Making A Purchase Of A Dog Training Collar


When you are making a purchase of a dog training collar, the myriad differences in the
specific brands and the choices of collars inside each brand can be overwhelming.
Sometime manufacturers tout their differences from the competitors and its difficult to
tell how much is real and how much is advertising. One of the ways to determine the real
differences is to find and a read dog training collar review. There are several such dog
training collar reviews on the internet.

There are other resources to tap to help in making this choice. One of the resources is a
local vet, could help you with their opinion. They can give you a view of which choices
you should most definitely not make, as not all collars are right for all dogs. Also, many
obedience class instructors have and use many of the dog training collars and could give
you their opinion or allow you to try the different choices during a training class. Each of
these individuals could give you an opinion on the dog training collar review information
that you obtained.

All dog training collar review information is not equal, as some are sponsored by the
manufactures of the different collars. Once you have your dog training collar reviews,
read through consumer reports and customer’s comments on the products you are
considering. Amazon.com provides sales of an amazing amount of items, and they keep
customer review and many of them, trying visiting their site to check.

Discount any collars which are clearly out of your price range. Do not feel bad about
this, there is absolutely no sense in spending more than you can afford when the simple
collars can provide what you need. Unless you have a disability that requires you to
choice a very high-end choice, you can consider the dog training collar reviews
inexpensive choices that may require a little more work on your part.

Check with a local vet or a local obedience trainer and see if they agree with the choice
you made. The most likely have experience with the products.

Don’t Do’s In Purchasing

Don’t buy the first dog training collar you see in a store, no matter what the store expert
tells you. Always do research in the information they provide, and don’t assume that you
got all the salient facts. Even if a dog training collar review agrees with the store expert,
spend just a little more time. Store experts may get a commission for certain
manufacturers and a dog training collar review may be sponsored by a company.
A last note, if you have a smaller dog make sure what you are looking at is a small dog
training collar. You need it positioned correctly on a small dog.

American Pit Bull Terrier Training: How To Train An
Aggressive Dog


If you have an aggressive dog, whatever the breed, this is an important topic.

American Pit Bull Terrier Training: How To Train An Aggressive Dog

Aggressive Pit Bulls can become a very serious problem if not dealt with in a proper
manner. New laws exist that state if a dog bites or attacks someone, the dog’s owner will
be held responsible and the dog put down. This is just another reason that Pit Bull owners
should invest the time and energy to properly train their dogs.

There are many different reasons why a Pit Bull terrier may become aggressive. Here are
a couple of the most common that I see:

- Your dog may feel that his territory is being invaded
- Your dog may feel threatened

When a dog exhibits signs of aggression, they usually come from a lack of confidence
and feelings of insecurity. Basic obedience training won’t solve your Pit Bull’s problem
with aggressive behavior, the only solution is serious dog training. Keep in mind that an
aggressive dog doesn’t just bite, he barks and lunges at people as well and he could also
attack another pet.

I would strongly recommend seeking the services of a professional dog trainer if you’re
having a real problem with aggression. Training an aggressive dog is a challenge and can
prove to be expensive, but it is a small price to pay when you consider you’ll be saving
your Pit’s life and possibly the life of some other animal or individual. To find a
professional trainer who handles cases of aggression, contact your local veterinarian and
ask for referrals.
Be sure that you do your homework and thoroughly investigate the schools which are
recommended. Look at their facilities and learn what methods they use when training
dogs. The last thing you want is for your Pit Bull to exhibit worse behavior after going
through training school than when he first entered.

I applaud your decision to be a responsible Pit Bull terrier owner and have your dog
trained. An aggressive Pit can halter the relationship that you have with him, hurt other
people, hurt other animals, and give this fabulous breed a bad reputation. After it is all
said and done, I’m certain you’ll agree that having your Pit Bull trained was a fantastic
decision!

Curbing Leash Aggression And Teaching Your Dog to
Stay
Many dogs have an aggressive side, and you often see this when they are on leashes.
Dogs that are normally well-behaved can lunge and snarl at other dogs and people as you
walk down the street. While he needs exercise, you do not want to put others at risk.
What can you do about leash aggression?

Skipping walks is not an option and may exacerbate the problem. Can you curb leash
aggression so your daily walks aren’t nightmares?

Dogs are like children in many ways. Often you can avoid bad behavior if you redirect
their attention. If you see something that usually causes your dog to become aggressive,
immediately distract him. Tell him to sit or lie down to keep him busy until the dog or
person passes.

If you are about to pass another dog, don’t tense up or pull the least taut. Your pet will be
able to tell and he will think that you are scared, so aggression is much more likely.
Animals pick up on our signals – just remain calm and relaxed.

Muzzles and gentle leader harnesses can be useful training tools for dogs who lunge.
Gentle leaders are designed to keep a dog from lunging, and muzzles will prevent biting.
If you use them, make sure to train your dog at the same time. Don’t plan on relying on
these tools indefinately.

At this point, if the leash aggression isn’t being eliminated, you might consider a trainer.
It can become very dangerous to other people and dogs in your neighborhood.

Many dogs pull on their leashes, especially when they are first being trained. Stopping
this behavior as soon as possible is important. It can lead to more annoyance at the very
least. At worst, it can hurt a person, pet, and you. Start early before you have to take more
drastic measures.
People are always impressed with well-trained dogs. Beyond impressing your friends and
neighbors, teaching your dog the stay command can be extremely useful. Treats and lots
of praise will make the learning process much easier, faster, and fun. For most complete
results consider SitStayFetch.

To learn to stay, your dog first needs to know how to sit and/or lie down. When he
masters this, staying is the next step. Begin by telling him to sit or lie down. As he does
this, put your hand out and say, “Stay.” Make sure you use a firm yet calm voice.

As soon as your dog obeys, say, “Good.” Even if the dog only stays for a brief second, it
is a great start. Praising can only help him learn more.

As he progressses, teach him when it is time to move. Many people say “Come” or “Ok”
to release their dogs. Again, make sure to praise him and give him a reward - this makes
the training process much easier and quicker.puppy potty training works especially well
when accompanied by praise and goodies.

As you work with your dog, you can lengthen the time your dog stays. Demand a little
more each time before you give him his treat.

At the same time, make sure you’re not extending your training sessions too long. Five
minutes is enough to get great results.

Any longer and your dog will feel like he’s in a marathon – he’ll get tired, cranky, and
won’t want to listen. At first, you may have to repeat, “Stay,” often to remind your dog,
especially if they’re excited about their treat.

As you continue training, your dog will be able to stay longer, even when you are not in
the room. You will not always have to provide a treat, but do always praise your dog and
his accomplishments.

SitStayFetch Review – How To Stop Bad Dog Behaviour
Posted by GoGoKitty: Steve on November 3, 2008
Dogs particularly from young should be trained to stop bad dog behaviour. I recommend
SitStayfetch by Daniel Stevens if you want to learn how to train your dog fast and
effectively.

Dogs are loyal companions though sometimes they can misbehave especially young
puppies. This may be in the form of barking non-stop, biting things around the house, or
digging holes in the back yard. No pet owner wants to have to deal with bad dog
behaviors like this. It´s not only frustrating, but it´s time consuming as well, if you don´t
know how to effectively correct the problem.

Adopting an animal when it is very young usually helps to initiate a lasting bond. Once a
small puppy is taken from its mother, it relies on its owner for direction. It is at this stage
that you want to start reinforcing certain things.

One of the most troublesome bad dog behaviors is playing with items the animal shouldn
´t be. Typically this is slippers, or small kids´ toys, it can even be expensive purses or
shoes. The dog has no idea what is and isn´t a toy, so it just assumes everything is.

The owner should be mindful of what it left within the dog´s reach and if he or she
notices the dog picking up something it shouldn´t be, a firm “no” always helps.
Repetition is often necessary to ensure the dog understands the rule and to correct this
type of dog behavior problems.

Accidents in the home sometimes occur and if they aren´t dealt with swiftly, the problem
can be a persistent one. Many puppies relieve themselves wherever and whenever the
mood strikes them. This is one of the bad dog behaviors that can really impact your life.
It´s important for the owner to take the dog outside at regular intervals when it is young
so it becomes accustomed to not going inside the house. If that´s not possible, you can
paper train the dog, which is also very helpful.

Biting is another issue that some dog owners find themselves facing. Typically it´s not
that the dog is meaning to bite anyone. It´s more that the dog is playing and nips at the
person. This is especially troubling if you have young children in the home. Correcting
bad dog behaviors like this is really important. You don´t want to end up having a dog
that bites people who are at your home visiting. This could have very serious results so
you need to work with the dog, by scolding it when it does attempt to play in this fashion.

It´s so nice to have a pet for the entire family to enjoy. With a little work and commitment
you can train your dog to be a wonderful and loving companion for years to come. Dog
behavior problems can always be corrected if you take the right approach.

I highly recommend SitStayFetch by Daniel Stevens if you want to put a stop to your
dog bad behavior. It is one of the best dog training course I have brought.

To Dog House Training
When training your dog, you should be thinking only of your desired results, and not the
actions you want to steer away from. So when you’re going through your training
routines, you need to have clear understanding of exactly what you want to happen, and
concentrate on that. Never give a second thought to the actions and behavior that you
want to avoid.

If you don’t know where you’re going, how can you get there? This applies to pretty
much everything we do every day of our lives, particularly when it comes to dog-house-
training-tips”>basic dog house training as well

It’s very easy to fall into the trap of concentrating on things that we don’t want. This is
also the case with dog training too. Not wanting our dog to pee anywhere inside our
house is right up there, or chew our shoes, or disobey our commands, or bark like
maniacs when we have friends come into the house.

But consider this for a second. Assuming you’re looking for new dog or puppy to bring
into your family. Would you actually relish the thought of relinquishing the next ten to
fourteen years chasing your dog telling him off for things you didn’t want him to do?
Don’t you think it’s a better idea to coach your dog to be obedient and socially
acceptable?

A prime example springs to mind is when we think, “I really do not want the dog to chew
the furniture,” try, “I want my dog to chew his toys.” Instead of, “I don’t want my dog to
jump up on my guests,” try instead, “I would like my dog to sit to greet people.”

By concentrating on what it is you want to achieve, you’ll know exactly what is you are
aiming for. I can’t think of a better way to get started with training your new dog.

Reward Good Behavior

Probably the best thing that has happened in housetraining puppy just recently is the trend
away from concentrating on correcting bad behavior, or punishing mistakes, to rewarding
obedience and favorable actions.

Most trainer now favor the practice of rewarding a well behaved dog especially for puppy
potty training tips. One of the critical reasons for this is that whenever you scald you dog
for making a mistake, the outcome can be pretty sad. If your dog is of a particular
temperament, he could possibly react to punishment by withdrawing and becoming
frightened of you. It’s always possible that he will withdraw completely and become very
timid. They seem to lose their sense of adventure. Some may even appear completely
broken spirited.
You also get a better sense of accomplishment and enlightenment when using reward
training techniques. Heaping praise and treats on your dog gives a powerful sense of
achievement.

But regardless of how good it makes you feel, rewards based training actually works. The
main reason being that rewards of this nature help to stimulate and build acceptable
behavior. As soon as she discovers that rewards come for a particular action of behavior,
your pet will want to repeat he behavior as often as possible. By figuring out how to
apply that simple rule, you will be able to use this method for pretty much any training
goal you want to achieve.

Why Owning A Backpack Dog Carrier Will Make
Traveling With Your Pet More Convenient
If you have a small dog and need a carrier, you no longer need to carry it in your hands.
There are now enjoyable backpack dog carriers on the market. The first products of this
kind are on the market and available commercially. You can purchase backpacks which
are collapsible, for easy storage. Your dog will have a comfortable and convenient place
to ride and you will have a cool, outdoor look.

Functions of Backpack Carriers

Good backpack dog carriers should have a bed that is removable and washable for easy
cleaning. There should also be a safety collar attachment clip to make sure that your pet
will not jump out. Some carriers double as car seats, for pets that have difficulty in the
car. Your pet’s carrier will be securely in place and then can be easily used as a backpack
when you arrive at your destination.

Some backpack dog carriers are combined with a wheel around and car seat. These are
especially useful on commercial airlines if they are an approved carrier. They are fairly
lightweight, with most of them coming in at approximately eight pounds.

Backpack carriers are meant to keep your pet securely in place while you are traveling,
without restricting the use of your arms. Both dogs and cats may have difficulty with this
process, because they are unfamiliar with the environment they are in. Choosing a carrier
with some luxury features may help ease their ride. They will come in handy whether
you are taking a long trip or just going to the store.

Materials and Design Concepts
Backpack dog carriers should be created of a soft yet strong material, such as nylon.
Frequently, a Denier nylon fiber is used. This fabric is resistant to tears, abrasions, and
breakage. The fabric is sporty and water resistant, to protect your pet in case of
problems. Make sure that you choose a carrier with good shoulder straps, to protect your
back and keep you comfortable.

When you purchase a dog carrier, consider any essentials that you would need to bring
with you. Many carriers come with pockets on the outside to store such material. Make
sure that the sides of the bag are a wide mesh, so that your pet has plenty of aeration and
visibility. See if the bag is constructed with a horizontal design, to ensure maximum
comfort for your pet.

More luxurious backpack carriers can be found for your dogs and cats. They are often
made with materials like black Microfiber or cotton weaves.Liners can be made of a
washable lambskin. Check the entry to the bag before you buy. Side entries are a
convenient way to get your pet in and out.

Many commercial airlines have approved a pet backpack called the Sherpa Bag. It
resembles a normal sports backpack and comes in different colors. It is a trendy and
popular way to tote your pet. Whichever you choose, keep the comfort and safety of your
pet in mind.

Fear of Dogs: Simple Ways To Get Rid of Your Fear Of
Dogs
Being scared of dogs is quite common. It often begins when we’re a child. Maybe you
were enjoying a game with a dog and without warning your dog got upset and started
growling at you. If that happens when you were older and wiser, no worries, you’d likely
not have an issue. But at a young age, suddenly your mind begins to think that a dog isn’t
actually man’s best friend.

The problem is that - despite what you may remember from school - we actually learn
quite fast, this idea gets stuck in our mind. Whether we like the idea or not.

So is there anything you can do to cut down being scared by dogs? Deep down, most of
them just want to make friends with you and be fed dog treats every now and then.

You could try and rationalize that “dogs are friendly” but you and I both know that you
won’t actually believe yourself. Especially as it’s almost 100% certain there’s a voice in
your head screaming (as they do in all the best pantomimes) “oh no they aren’t!”

The next thing to try is to put yourself close enough to dogs that you see them but don’t
stand any chance of actually meeting one face to face or or encounter it jumping onto you
and smother you with muddy paw prints. Pictures work well for this stage. Unless your
mind is working overtime, you know that the picture is actually some dollops of ink on
paper or a bunch of glowing dots on your computer monitor. So this is quite a safe
transition stage for most people and you’ll probably find yourself being a little less
worried at the thought of coming face to face with a dog in real life.

But all this is slow progress and we all like instant results nowadays. What do you do if
your kids absolutely must have a dog and they won’t take no for an answer.

A much faster way to get over things such as a fear of dogs|being afraid of dogs is to use
hypnosis. This works quickly and easily. And no-one but you will ever realize you’re
using hypnosis since you can get an instant MP3 download of hypnosis for dog phobia
and listen to it until your fear melts away.

Dog Pictures Fetch Cash on eBay
It may astound you, but one of the simplest things to sell on eBay is bits of paper. But
only if you know the right type of paper to list.

You can even make money by offering old pictures for sale that cost you little or nothing
to acquire. There is one subject that, year after year, will almost always sell: dogs.

Yes, I’m telling you it’s true. Dogs really can put money in the bank!

The business of finding old dog pictures and selling them to dog lovers can be a good
one, and there is room for plenty more people to jump into it. So, there’s room for more
folks to get in and make money.

The most attractive part of this moneymaking idea is that you may be able to obtain your
stock (old pictures of dogs) virtually cost-free. Then you just turn around and sell the
pictures at a premium on eBay or another auction site.

It is possible, as some have shown, to make a living doing this. Dogs are certainly a good
subject to concentrate on, but others do well, too: sailing ships and locomotives, for
example.

Undoubtedly you’re wondering: Where can I find these old dog pictures? Here’s the
answer: Photos and drawings from old books that you can find dirt cheap in yard sales
and online.

It’s an amazing fact: Oftentimes, you can sell a single image, carefully cut from an old
book, for several times what the book itself cost. Your job, then, is to find the folks who
are hunting for a specific photographic or art subject.
Dogs are among the top selling subjects. Some buyers out there will snap up almost any
kind of dog image. Then there are others who prefer to collect photographs, paintings and
drawings of a specific breed of dog. For example, a fan of weiner dogs might have
hundreds of paintings and prints of them hanging throughout his house.

It’s not at all difficult to find old books that are full of wonderful images of dogs, even
books that were published a century or more ago. Some of them might contain 20, 30 or
more such plates.

When you find such a book, you can carefully remove the pages with the illustrations,
and mat them them individually. Get this: You can often turn around and sell them for
$50, or a $100–or even more!–on eBay.

Big tip: Hunting breeds are among the most highly prized dog pictures.But you can sell
photos and prints of practically any kind of dog for a good return on eBay.

Besides the aforementioned dogs, ships and trains, keep an eye out for books with prints
of old timey cars, cities and towns, country scenes, and horses. There are other topics that
sell well, too.

To be successful in this, you must take time to learn where to find old books with the
images that will sell. You must also learn how to remove the images so as to prevent
damage. As well, you must spend the time to learn the art of mounting and presenting
them to bring in the high bidders. The authoritative source on all of this is How To Make
Money By Tearing Up Old Books And Selling Them On eBay.

This is the bottom line? So, are you hoping to find a novel (and fun!) way to make money
on the Internet? Well, then, the dog may truly be your best friend. (And here’s an
objective look at the business of selling paper online.)

A Guide To Dog Training


Before starting dog training, it is best that you know your options well. These days you
can find many types of dog training, in many different places. These trainings vary in
price and each one them has something different to offer.

The first type of dog training is known as puppy preschool. This is a dog training course
meant for puppies that are about 6 weeks to 5 months old. These puppy preschool classes
generally last for no more than 6 to 8 weeks. In these training sessions, your puppy is
essentially taught how to socialize with people and as well as other puppies. Here your
puppy also begins to learn how to sit down, stay at a place, and how to come.

The second type of dog training course is meant for the dogs that are at least 5 months
old. This type of dog training is known as the basic dog training. The duration of these
classes is usually about 8 to 10 weeks. This is the basic course, where your dog is taught
the art of walking properly on a leash, sitting, staying, coming and heeling.

The third type of dog training course is known as the intermediate dog training. This dog
training aims at teaching the dog mostly the same things that are taught in the basic
training course, in a more detailed form. Here the dog is trained to stay for a longer span
of time, and is also taught to follow the orders given by other people.

The intermediate dog training generally lasts for about 8 to 10 weeks, and is meant for
those that are no less than 5 months old. It is essential for the dog to have completed its
basic dog training course, or to be accustomed to the basic commands that could have
been taught by the owner.

The next type of training course is known as the advanced dog training course. Here,
once again, the course is quite similar to its previous one, i.e., the intermediate dog
training course, except for the fact that this time it is more detailed. Here, the dog is
taught how to sit even without you in the view.

This training course is about 8 to 10 weeks long, and is meant for those that have
completed their intermediate training. Here, they are also trained to walk beside their
owners without a leash. Moreover, it gradually prepares the dog to take the Canine Good
Citizen training course. The Canine Good Citizen training for dogs is the last course. To
pass this course, your dog will be taught the 10 necessary aspects.

This course is strictly meant for those dogs that have completed all the previous courses.
The test is quite tough and can only be passed if the dog is really well behaved.
Depending on whether your dog can pass, the course can last for several weeks.

Keeping this information in mind, you should be able to decide the dog training course
best suited for your dog. However, you may seek the opinion of your local dog trainers to
know more. Many trainers consult for free. So now you should be at least a step closer to
introducing your dog into a training course!

Custom Cedar Dog House – Advantages Of Building
Your Own Wooden Dog House
No one knows whether dogs actually prefer dog houses or not. But cedar dog houses are
one of the most common materials used to build dog houses.
If you have a large sized dog in your home, then a custom cedar dog house is needed.
However, buying large wooden dog house is often not easy as not many pet shops or
online stores sell large custom dog houses.

The most practical way is to do it yourself. There are several doghouse plans you can find
online. You can then simply pass it to your contractor to build one for you or do
everything yourself.

One advantage of building your own custom cedar dog house is that you can decide on
how big or small your doghouse should be. You can even build a custom cedar wooden
dog house large enough to accommodate two or more dogs.

So after you build the dog house, where should you place it? Most people put their
doghouse at the back of the house.

However, it may not be a good idea. This is because dogs are social animals and love to
be near humans. By placing your doghouse at the back of the house or away from
humans, most dogs may not even want to stay in their dog house.

That is why I recommend placing your dog house in front of your house or at the side of
the home.

The dog house should also be jacked up off the ground, preferably with slabs underneath
the foundation to trap airspace. It aids in insulation and can help keep your doghouse
warm during winter months.

For wind insulation, you can install a flap in front of the dog house.

Lastly, make sure to keep the doghouse clean by making sure waste material and urine
are not near the doghouse.

If you want a comfortable home for your large sized dog, then building and maintaining a
custom cedar wood dog house is recommended.

American Pit Bull Terrier: Is It The Right Dog Breed
For You?
If you’re thinking about owning a Pit Bull terrier, it is important to understand the
characteristics of the breed as well as your current lifestyle. Caring for a Pit Bull is a
long-term commitment that needs to be taken seriously, not just a simple hobby that you
participate in when time permits.

Unfortunately it is very difficult for many dogs to find a second home in the event that
their owners “change their minds” and decide they don’t want a dog after all. The
situation is even worse for Pit Bulls due to their reputation in today’s society.

Do you have the time and the energy to commit to a high energy breed such as a Pit Bull?
Pit Bull terriers have very high exercise requirements and are happiest when they get
plenty of play time.

If you are interested in owning a Pit Bull, you should possess a similar sense of
adventure. A day at the beach, a park, or just playing frisbee in the backyard are all
excellent things to do with your four-legged friend. These activities will also strengthen
the bond between you and your dog and make ownership even more rewarding.

If you’re more of an inside person however and don’t enjoy exercising daily, you should
seriously rethink your idea of Pit Bull ownership. There are many other excellent dog
breeds that will probably be more suitable to your lifestyle and it isn’t fair to penalize
your dog simply because you are too selfish to get an alternative breed.

If you still are set on owning a Pit Bull, it is important that you begin training your dog as
soon as you bring him home. Pit Bulls who aren’t properly trained can become more
than a handful. On the other hand, a well-trained Pit can regularly impress others with
good behavior.

A Golden Retriever Might be the Right Addition to
Your Family
A Golden Retriever Might be the Right Addition to Your Family

Selecting the right dog-breeds/”>dog breed for you and your family is an important
decision. There are several hundred breeds of dogs from around the world so your
choices are virtually limitless.

The American Kennel Club categorized the different breeds by groups with each group
having distinguishing characteristics that are shared by all the breeds in it. The Golden
Retriever is in the Sporting Group.

The Sporting Group is made up of some of the oldest and most popular dog breeds.
Many of the dogs in this category were bred for hunting although most people who own
sporting dogs only keep them as family pets, rather than hunters. The hunting traits,
however, create some of the most enjoyable aspects of owning a sporting dog. Goldens
are natural retrievers, so you can enjoy them fetching a tennis ball for what seems like
forever. Another trait is their outgoing personality, making sporting dogs enthusiastic and
responsive partners.

The Golden Retriever was bred to be tough and strong. Don’t let the happy, silly face
fool you. While any Golden will delight in lazing around the house or wrestling on the
floor with your family, the dog breed is particularly adept in the field.

As puppies, Goldens are full of energy and can be especially mouthy. Make sure you
direct your puppy’s need to chew to appropriate chew toys. Remember, puppies aren’t
fussy and don’t discriminate. A chair leg works as well for them as a sterilized bone.
Goldens are very trainable, athletic, and good-natured. They have a keen desire to please.
You can find them performing with tails wagging and eyes shining in the obedience,
agility, and fly ball arenas. They are also excellent with children.
The Golden Retriever is generally light yellow to deep golden honey in color. The coat
tends to get a little deeper in color after the first year. They tend to be about twenty-four
inches tall at the withers (shoulders), with females being slightly shorter. Their coat
should be long and either flat or wavy. They’ll need to be brushed properly or their coat
will form thick mats

So, if you are looking for a loyal companion that will be great with kids or adults, you
should definitely find a local breeder and spend some time getting to know a Golden.

“Hybrid” dog – Isn’t that just another word for Mutt?
“Hybrid” dog – Isn’t that just another word for Mutt?

Every day we hear more about the new “hybrid” dogs, or “designer” dogs. Each feature is
accompanied by pictures of adorable puppies that are examples of this new “breed of
dog.”

Of course they’re cute! All puppies are! Should you pay hundreds, and in some cases,
thousands of dollars for one? Certainly not! The offspring of a mating between two
purebred dogs of different breeds is a mongrel, a mutt. And if you have one, you should
love it, train it and care for it as if it had the bluest blood of the canine kingdom.

Every dog breed, and there are hundreds in the world, was “created” by humans. Each
breed was developed for a specific purpose – whether that original job was guarding the
flock or being the ideal lap-dog. There’s no reason that development shouldn’t continue.
If there is a need for a dog with particular characteristics, enterprising individuals will
come forward to fill that need.

However, it takes many generations to “breed true.” Compare yourself to your siblings.
Do you all have the same looks, same personality, same interests and strengths? Chances
are, you don’t. Each of you has some of the “best” traits of your parents. But those may
not be the same traits. And each of you has some of the worst.

Two of the best-known mixed-breeds out there now are the “Golden Doodle” and the
“Puggle.” The thinking behind these crosses is fairly obvious: wouldn’t it be nice to have
a Golden Retriever’s personality and willingness to please combined with the Poodle’s
non-shedding coat and intelligence? Wouldn’t it be equally delightful to have a small dog
without the breathing issues of a Pug, but quieter than a Beagle?

But there is no way of knowing you won’t get a high-strung, noisy, stubborn, slobbering
mutt who sheds like the dickens!

If you are considering spending the kind of money that these “hybrids” are commanding,
be sure to research all of the traits of the contributing breeds. You will get a mixture of
the two. And an equally adorable mixture may be waiting for you at your local shelter –
the size you want, with the coat you want and the adorable face that melts your heart.

If you require certain characteristics in your puppy – whether a family member has
allergies, or you have a very small, or no yard, or your household requires a quiet, “easy
keeper,” or if you wish to fully participate in the world of canine competition, consider a
pure-bred dog. There are over 150 breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club.
Research them at www.akc.org. Surely one of them is right for you.

6 Great Tips For Getting Your Dog Toilet Trained
6 Great Tips For Getting Your Dog Toilet Trained

One of the toughest jobs that a family faces when a new puppy comes home is getting the
dog housebroken. This means that the dog will eliminate outdoors and not use your home
and furnishings as a toilet. Lots of people think that getting doggy toilet trained is a tough
task, but it doesn’t need to be. If you arm yourself with plenty of information for the best
ways to get your dog house trained, you are on the right path to having a dog that goes to
the bathroom where you want him to go.

When to House Train

A dog can be toilet trained at any age, but the best age to begin is between eight and
twelve weeks old. If you set up a housebreaking routine as soon as you bring your puppy
home, before long he will get the right idea of where to do his business. A crate is a great
tool for toilet training a puppy. It keeps him confined when there is no supervision and
most dogs learn quickly that if they make in their crate they will have to sit in it. Most
dogs are fairly hygienic and won’t enjoy having to sit in dog doody or urine.
The Advantages of Using a Crate

Be sure there is enough room in the crate for your pup to turn around, but don’t leave so
much room that he will be able to eliminate and lie down far away from it. Many dog
owners view a crate as a jail cell or to use as punishment, but your dog will love having
his own space where he can escape from the hustle and bustle of the household for some
quiet time. Make your dogs crate a happy place and don’t use it for punishment. You can
feed your dog in the crate, or while he is in there, offer him some treats. Place a favorite
chewy or toy in there with him, add blankets and he will have a cozy den to escape to
whenever he feels the need. Utilizing a crate for your dog can keep him out of trouble and
not only in housebreaking.

Keep Your Eyes Peeled

Keeping a close eye on your puppy is a key factor in getting him properly housetrained.
Whenever you see that he is sniffing, circling or beginning to squat, immediately take
him outside to the place where you want him to go and see if he eliminates. If he does,
praise him lavishly. A good idea is to have a cue, such as “hurry up” so that your puppy
knows what you want him to do. When he is going to the bathroom repeat the cue and
then give your dog lots of praise for a job well done. It is better to take the dog out and
nothing happens then take a chance of an accident happening.

Have a Schedule

Feeding, watering and walking your dog on a regular schedule will make housebreaking
that much easier. Puppies are like children and they thrive on a routine. Try and take the
dog out around the same time everyday so they will be able to adjust their bodily
functions. The first thing you should do in the morning is take the puppy from the crate
and don’t let his feet touch the ground. Bring him to the place where you want him to go,
give the cue, and praise upon a successful completion. Take your puppy out at least every
two hours, after eating or drinking and especially after play. Before you know it, your
puppy will be letting you know it is time to go out and do his business.

Don’t Let the Puppy Roam

Letting your puppy roam around the house is a sure fire way to have accidents. If you
have decided you don’t want to use a crate, and even if you do use one, confining the dog
to certain areas of the house can make housetraining easier for everyone. It is difficult to
keep track of a puppy when he has the run of the house, but if you gate him in the
kitchen, he will still be able to be part of the action and can be better supervised in case of
an accident.

Don’t Get Discouraged

There will be times when you first begin housetraining that you feel your pup is just not
getting it. He may have accidents in the house as well on occasion. There is no need to be
discouraged. If you stick to your routine, keep a good eye on the dog and make frequent
outings to his outdoor bathroom, in no time your puppy will be housebroken. Another
good idea is to use the same door all the time when you are taking him out so that when
he has to go, he will scratch on the door to be let out. Once this happens, you can say
hurray and know that your puppy truly is beginning to understand that going to the
bathroom in the house is a no-no.




6 easy ways to find a good dog training professional
6 easy ways to find a good dog training professional

Finding a good dog training professional
With so many people advertising in the field of professional dog training today, trying to
determine who’s truly qualified to look after your dog can be overwhelming. What to
look for when choosing a professional to help you with dog training :

1) A good reputation, ask around and get recommendations from your vet, other dog
owners, or local kennel clubs.
2) Experience. - Inquire about their background, i.e. number of years experience.
3)A genuine love of and devotion to dogs.
4) Extensive and up to date knowledge. Dedicated trainers keep themselves updated by
attending dog training and animal behaviour courses, conferences, seminars and
workshops.
5) Their training methodology and handling skills. A good trainers first concern should be
the dogs well being.
6) Memberships with reputable associations, organizations and training clubs.

General dog obedience tips

Training should be a positive and enjoyable experience for both you and your dog. If you
are not in the right mood for training, don’t even begin. Always reward your dog for
obeying your commands promptly! A reward is anything that your dog wants and is
willing to work for. Treats are an obvious reward but other rewards could be verbal praise
and toys. Several shorter sessions are usually better than one long one. Training should
not involve any negative components or punishment . There should be no shouting, no
hitting or smacking, no chain jerking on choke chains or collars, and absolutely no
electric shocking! Each training session should be enjoyable and positive with rewards
for jobs well done.

Training with head collars
Pulling on the lead is one of the few unpleasant experiences of bringing up a new puppy
or dog. Using a head collar for dog training has become very popular over the last few
years. Training with a head collar does have some advantages over the traditional training
collar. Although very simple to use, it is important that head collars are fitted correctly
and your dog properly introduced to the collar. Head collars are generally more intuitive
to use than a traditional training collar. Head collars are very effective when controlling
dogs in difficult situations.

In medieval Europe, in the areas surrounding present-day Germany, there are records of a breed of 
dog called the Teckel that was bred for hunting purposes.  The Teckel, with its long torso and 
short legs, is considered to be the ancestor of today's Dachshund.  With "dachs" meaning 
badger and  "hund"  meaning dog, the name Dachshund comes from what the breeds were originally 
developed for, which was to chase badgers and foxes down into their burrows.
While today's Dachshunds are considered loveable domestic dogs everywhere, they used to 
be treated as hunting dogs in Germany, the country of origin. The classification of Dachshund 
breeds traces back to these hunting days.  
They are grouped according to the circumference of their chest to match the burrow size they 
can fit into, with the largest being the Standard (over 35 cm), followed by the Miniature (under 35 
cm), and the smallest being the Kanichen (under 30 cm).  
They are also classified into three coat types: Smooth-haired, Long-haired, and Wire-haired.        
Dachshunds have friendly, lively qualities.  They are loyal to their masters, patient, calm and when 
there is a visitor they will let their masters know by barking.  Cleverness and an intelligent-looking 
facial expression also add to the appeal of the Dachshund. 
This Papercraft is a model of the standard-size smooth-haired Dachshund, the most orthodox 
type, and is approximately half the size of a real Dachshund.

Dog Training Equipment How to choose the most appropriate training gear for your dog
By Pat Miller One bright spring Sunday, my husband and I took a motorcycle trip through Virginia, stopping in the dogfriendly town of Leesburg for lunch. As we ate I watched a steady stream of leashed dogs walk by our restaurant window. Before long I noticed a strange consistency: every single dog was wearing a prong collar. The sun dimmed a little for me, because I cannot imagine a training situation for which I would be willing to use a prong collar - and I certainly wouldn‟t use one as an everyday dog-walking tool. But the collars appeared to be commonly accepted and used in that community. A roomful of dog trainers will never agree on the best equipment for walking, training, or exercising a dog. If you restrict membership in the room to “positive” trainers you‟ll find more agreement, but you‟ll still be a long way from unanimity. Even with a shared dog-friendly training philosophy, experiences with and opinions of various training tools will differ. How do you decide which training equipment is right for you and your dog?

The goal: A happy, confident, well-behaved dog, who understands how to elicit frequent praise and rewards from his happy, positive owner. His collar and leash are essentially a backup safety device to keep him attached to his owner – not necessary to physically control or restrain him.

Your responsibility First, understand that you, alone, are responsible for choosing appropriate, humane, effective training equipment for your dog - not Whole Dog Journal, your trainer, spouse, your dog‟s breeder, or acquaintances from the dog park. It‟s your responsibility to make sure that the equipment fits your dog properly, and that it does not hurt or stress your dog. Ask for the opinion of dog-friendly professionals you trust, but don‟t be pressured into using any gear that appears to bother your dog if you want him to trust you and enjoy your time together. Next, think about your dog training philosophy and mission, as these will at least partly dictate what sort of training tools you‟ll consider. The more committed you are to your own training mission, the easier the decisions become about which tools you‟re willing to use; either they‟re congruent with your philosophy, or they‟re not. For example, if you, like me, are strongly committed to positive, “do no harm” training, you‟ll automatically rule out the use of training tools that are designed to inflict discomfort on the dog. Tools that positive trainers choose to use most often are generally neutral at their worst, and at best, positively reinforcing. My professional mission is to train animals and their humans using modern, effective methods based on sound scientific principles of learning and behavior, with an overriding emphasis on positive reinforcement. Whole Dog Journal‟s mission statement says, “The methods we discuss will endeavor to do no harm to dogs; we do not advocate perpetrating even minor transgressions in the name of „greater good.‟”

Tools and fools Some people will argue that all training tools are neutral - that it‟s the way they are used that can cause pain or harm to a dog. These people sometimes say, “It‟s not the tool, it‟s the fool . . .” suggesting that if a “fool” chooses to use equipment harshly, it‟s not the faul t of the equipment. Perhaps. However, it‟s a plain and simple fact that some tools are designed and built to be strongly aversive to the dog, some mildly aversive, and still others are designed to be non-aversive. In behavioral science, the term aversive is defined as something the subject (in this case, a dog) will work to avoid, and a reinforcer is something the dog will work to obtain. Positive training rests solidly on the philosophy that it‟s more effective and more humane to award primary and second ary reinforcers for desirable behaviors, rather than apply aversives for undesirable ones. In other words, we seek to set the dog up for success and teach him what to do, instead of setting him up to make mistakes and teaching him what not to do. Note that it doesn‟t matter that you think cheese is delicious; if your dog spits it out, it‟s not a reinforcer for him, and if you try to use it to reward him your training will fail. The same principle applies to pats on the head, praise, or anything else you use to reward your dog. If he likes it, it‟s a reinforcer. If he doesn‟t, it‟s not. The solution to a reinforcer that doesn‟t work is to find something more reinforcing.

This dog clearly has a positive association with her leash.

On the other side of the coin, if something you do to the dog doesn‟t cause him enough discomfort that he works to avoid it, it will fail as an aversive. For example, if your dog pulls, and you put a choke collar on him, but aren‟t willing or able to jerk the leash strongly e nough to be aversive to the dog, the dog will keep pulling. This is why so many dogs pull, gagging and choking on the end of their choke collars. Here‟s the problem: The only way to make an ineffective aversive more effective is to cause more discomfort - a tactic that actually encourages escalating levels of force or pain in order to achieve training goals. Enter the prong collar and the shock collar, which are designed to deliver more discomfort to the dog with less handler effort. We‟ve presented many articles in Whole Dog Journal that explain why we promote positive training. Some of the risks of aversive techniques are listed in “The Potential Pitfalls of Punishment,” below. You have to decide what techniques and tools are right for training and handling your dog, based on your unique training philosophy. To help you analyze which tools are most likely to help you, without hurting your dog, I‟ll share my professional opinions about the tools most commonly recommended by positive trainers, always with an eye to whether their intended function is neutral, reinforcing, or aversive, and how they may be, in fact, perceived by the dog. Basic leashes Cotton, leather, and nylon leashes are designed to be neutral, and most dogs appear to perceive them that way, at least initially. If your dog makes a positive association with the leash (leash means walk YAY!) then it can be used as a reinforcer. Your dog can learn to work (sit) for the leash if he learns that “sit” means the leash appears, which makes a walk happen. If the leash is used as a tug toy (as widely practiced by some agility trainers), then the positive association is “leash means play!” and leash -play is a reinforcer for good or excellent behavior on the agility course.

A leash can also be an aversive, if a dog makes an association between wearing the leash and being punished during training or while walking. For some dogs, the positive associations of going for a walk or training can outweigh the negative associations of aversive tools sometimes used in walking or training. The dog may still enjoy the activity, although perhaps not as fully as if the aversives weren‟t in use. Stretch leashes Some have built-in elastic pieces; others are comprised of a length of stretchy rubber tubing. The elasticity is meant to absorb the impact that occurs when your dog hits the end of the leash with his body weight. Used carefully, this feature might minimize or prevent damage to your dog‟s trachea.

Limited-slip collar.

However, these leashes are usually marketed as a way to decrease your dog‟s pulling behavior. If it does succeed in doing that (which may be doubtful) it does so by working as a mild aversive. This is confirmed by makers of the products; we found the following statements in ads or packages for products of this type: “Made from latex that will stretch to more than six feet in length; this stretching continuously, gently corrects your pet.”

“As your dog pulls, the leash stretches, and the resistance your pet experiences teaches them [sic] not to tug anymore.” “While softening the shock against the dog‟s neck, reducing the risk of throat and spinal injuries, the leash delivers an effective correction and release.” Note the use of terms such as “correction” and “teaches them not to” (our emphasis). These are your clues that the intent of the product is to teach the dog what not to do (not pull) rather than to reinforce the desired behavior and thereby teach him what to do (walk politely). Remember that this is the basic philosophical difference between positive training and training with aversives. Long lines Many long-line products are available, from light lines (thin nylon cords) to long lines (flat cotton or nylon) that range in length from 10 to 60 feet or more. Long lines are neutral tools that can be given a reinforcing or aversive association for your dog, depending on how they‟re used.

In general, the purpose of a long line is to give your dog more freedom while still maintaining control very useful when you‟re working to generalize a reliable recall, or just to give your dog more exercise. When used with proper safety precautions, I find they fit nicely into my training philosophy. My cautions include:  Long lines should not be used where the line might pose a tripping or tangling danger to other dogs or humans.  Be careful not to let your dog run full-speed into the end of a long line for fear of injury to his spine.  Don‟t let go! If your dog runs off into the woods dragging a long line, he can get tangled and trapped. Retractable leashes The retractable leash is commonly seen on trails, in dog parks, and on city streets. Invented in Germany, the leash consists of a plastic handle in which a spring-loaded cord is stored. When the dog moves away from the owner, the cords unreels anywhere from 15 to 30 feet, depending on the model; when the dog moves toward the owner the cord retracts into the handle. The owner can lock the leash at any time by pushing a button on the handle. While it is neutral by design, as a tool, the retractable leash can be detrimental to training a dog to display polite leash manners. It teaches a dog that pulling against the tension of the spring-loaded cord frequently gets reinforced with greater freedom. A handler can eliminate this inadvertent reward by locking the button, preventing the leash from paying out more cord - then he may as well use a regular leash! Retractable leashes also send the dog confusingly mixed messages: sometimes you have to stay close; sometimes you can go 30 feet away. This plainly encourages dogs to pull frequently to test the distance allowed at any given time. I don‟t recommend their use.

The concerns mentioned above about long lines also apply to retractable leads. Here are some additional caveats:  If the line does get wrapped around dog or human, the narrow cord can cause serious injury burns, cuts, even amputation of digits.  Unlike a long line, which must constantly be managed, it‟s easy for an owner to be inattentive to the retractable leash, since it manages itself. Inattentive users may inadvertently allow their dogs to do inappropriate things, like rudely approaching other dogs and people.  The handle can be cumbersome to hold and is easily dropped. When dropped, the clatter can frighten the dog, and if he bolts, he is chased by the loud, clattering handle. This can pose a disaster for a frightened dog! Flat collars Buckle or snap; nylon, cloth, or leather; this is a neutral, inoffensive tool. Its primary purpose is for hanging ID tags; providing an attachment for a leash is its secondary use. Of course, “the fool” can misuse a flat collar, but it‟s not intended to be used aversively.

The potential for misuse of a flat collar includes forgetting to adjust it as your dog grows (shelters around the country come upon dogs with ingrown collars from time to time - grounds for cruelty charges); yanking on the leash to “correct” your dog; and adjusting it too loosely around your dog‟s neck so that he can back out of it and escape. Limited-slip collars Also called a martingale or Greyhound collar, the limited-slip collar is a flat collar with a loop incorporated into the product so the collar tightens around the dog‟s neck if he tries to back out of it - a maneuver that some dogs are quite skilled at performing. Properly adjusted, the collar tightens just to the size of the dog‟s neck, and doesn‟t cause choking. Limited-slip collars are especially useful for dogs with narrow heads, who can easily slip out of even a moderately tight collar. I recommend them to some of my clients, and we use one on our Australian Shepherd, who came to us with a well-practiced collar-slipping maneuver in her behavior repertoire. Head collars/halters Hailed as a positive training tool when it first arrived on the scene in the mid 1990s, the head halter has stirred much discussion among trainers. This tool works like a halter on a horse; it controls the dog‟s head, and where the head goes, the body must follow. Some halter proponents suggest that it also mimics the sensation of a mother dog carrying her puppy by the scruff, and that this function calms the dog wearing the halter. I‟m not convinced, and I haven‟t seen any studies to support this hypothesis. To the human perception, the head halter appears much more positive than a chain, prong, or shock collar around a dog‟s neck. To a significant number of dogs, however, the halter seems to be at least mildly (and in many cases greatly) aversive. Most dogs need to be desensitized to a head halter prior to actual use. If you put it on without a gradual introduction and lots of association with a reinforcer (treats!) you‟re likely to get lots of resistance from the dog - pawing and clawing at the halter, bucking against the leash, and attempts to rub it off. Many dogs, even wh en they‟ve accepted it, will still try to rub it off if given the opportunity.

In addition, the head halter tends to suppress behavior and subdue the wearer. People often mistake “subdued” for “calm.” If your dog‟s whole personality changes - his tail droops, his eyes lose their sparkle - then you‟re looking at a subdued dog, not a calm one. There may be times when that‟s useful, but a positive training program generally avoids behavior suppression and encourages the dog to offer behaviors that can be reinforced. There are a number of different models of head halter. Each new design that comes on the scene purports to be more easily accepted by the dog. That tells you something! This is one of the tools that positive trainers disagree about. I still have head halters in my supply cabinet and may find a rare occasion to use one, but I generally encourage clients to consider other options. Other trainers rely heavily on head halters, and report very little problem with acclimating their clients‟ dogs to them. As always, your dog is the one who should decide. If he tells you he finds it aversive, listen. One of the concerns about head halter use is the potential for injury to the dog‟s spine if he lunges at the end of the leash and the halter pulls his head sideways. Until recently, the inventor of the original design stoutly asserted that there were no proven cases of injury related to head halter use. In 2007, one clearly verifiable incident was reported of a dog suffering injury to the nervous system as a direct result of the head halter. The dog recovered. Walking harnesses A well-fitted walking harness presents little in the way of aversive application. It‟s an excellent option to prevent pressure on and damage to the trachea - useful for dogs who have suffered tracheal injury, as well as dogs in general. Because it is so comfortable, a walking harness can actually contribute to the reinforcement of pulling behavior, especially if the human on the other end of the leash allows the dog to move forward while pulling. Because the harness straps distribute pressure across the dog‟s chest, discomfort is mild, if it exists at all, and it‟s easy for the dog to pull. That‟s why they use harnesses for sled dogs!

Another consideration is that the leash usually attaches to a ring on the harness at the middle of the dog‟s back, which gives the human very little control of the dog‟s front end. Properly used in training, with reinforcement for appropriate leash behavior, a walking harness can complement a positive training program.

Some walking harnesses offer a ring in front, at the dog‟s chest, similar to front -clip control harnesses (see next page). That may be a good choice for the dog who does well in a walking harness but tends to pull. No-pull squeeze harnesses This type of harness has straps that tighten around the dog‟s front legs when he pulls. There are several different brands, but they all function similarly. This tool may be mildly aversive, or simply provide a novel sensation that causes the dog to slow down. Either way, in order to be effective, the trainer must reinforce the improved leash behavior provided by the dog‟s response to pressure, or the dog tends to fairly quickly learn to pull despite the pressure. In the models I‟ve seen, the leash attaches to a ring on the dog‟s back, again giving little control of the front end. Dogs don‟t seem to find them particularly aversive, but I‟m not sure they‟re particularly effective. Front-clip control harnesses This training tool offers one significant advantage over most walking harnesses: the leash attaches to a ring at the front of the dog‟s chest, providing better control of the dog‟s front end. The majority of dogs accept this tool without protest, and for many, there is an instantaneous and significant decrease in pulling and increase in owner control. Combined with reinforcement for polite walking this is my positive tool of choice for dogs who pull. That said, it‟s not the right tool for all dogs. A small percentage of dogs do object to the harness. Also, some dogs are difficult to fit, and others experience chafing under the front legs where the straps can rub. Attaching your leash to the front ring of a regular walking harness (some have it, some don‟t - shop carefully!) may be a better choice for dogs who have trouble with the front-clip control version. The answer is . . . Again, you have to decide which equipment best suits your dog. Keep the pros and cons of each training tool in mind, be true to your training philosophy, listen to and respect your dog, and let the sun shine.

For shelter dogs, having good manners will impress
potential adopters and increase their chances of adoption.
And for dogs already in a home environment, training can
be the key to a happy, healthy bond between families and
their dogs.
Training is an excellent source of mental stimulation
for any dog. Spend a few minutes a day working on the
following basic manners with your dogs and you’ll give
them the tools they need to succeed!

POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT
Positive reinforcement utilizes anything that, when
presented immediately following a behavior, causes the
behavior to increase in frequency. The most commonly
used reinforcers are treats and verbal praise, but some
dogs respond well to favorite toys and activities. The
most important thing is that the reinforcer must be
pleasing to your individual dog.
After you determine what to use as a positive reinforcer
with your dog, you can then utilize it to strengthen your
dog’s behavior in various scenarios by presenting the
desired item immediately following your dog’s actions.
By rewarding them for their behavior, your dog will be
more likely to repeat his actions the next time he encounters a similar situation.

Dogs can also reinforce themselves by acquiring something they want on their own.

Here’s an example of Positive Reinforcement:
• You ask the dog to sit.
• He sits.
• You give him a treat.
• He is more likely to sit the next time you ask.

t r A i n i n g

Dogs learn through consequences, just like humans do. Consequences can be positive, which will
increase the likelihood of the behavior happening again, or they can be negative, which will decrease
the likelihood of the behavior happening again. Our training handouts teach dogs by using positive
reinforcement, such as treats and praise, to increase desired behaviors, like sitting and staying.

Here’s an example of how a dog can provide himself
with a reward for his behavior:
• You left a piece of steak on the counter.
• Your dog jumped up, grabbed the steak off the
counter, and ate it.
• Oops – your dog reinforced himself by getting
a reward for counter surfing!
• Your dog is going to be more likely to jump on
the counter the next time food is left out.
In order to control what your dog is rewarded for
(instead of letting your dog reward himself for
unwanted behaviors) you’ll need to manage positive
reinforcements by setting your dog up for success. You
can do this by putting away items you don’t want your
dog to have (such as food, shoes, or children’s toys) or
restricting your dog’s access to these items by using
gates or crates.
TIPS FOR USING POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT EFFECTIVELY
For maximum effectiveness, a reinforcer should
be given immediately after the desired response.
Immediately means within seconds of
your dog performing the desired action.
This very small window is when dogs
can make the connection between their
actions resulting in a reward. If more
time goes by, your dog may not understand why he is being rewarded. For
example, if your dog stands up, after
they successfully perform the desired
sit, but you give them the reward anyway, they’ll think you’ve rewarded them
for standing up, not sitting. Remember,
the reinforcer can only strengthen the behavior that it
immediately follows.
SECONDARY REINFORCER
Because it can be difficult to accurately time the treat
so that our dogs make the connection between their

action and receiving the reward, we can use a secondary
reinforcer to bridge the time between the behavior and
the delivery of the reward.
The most common and effective secondary reinforcers
are marker words (such as “yes”) and clickers. We can
quickly deliver a well-timed “yes” or a click within a
second of our dog performing the desired behavior.
This quick and clear message helps dogs learn effectively.
Using an audible secondary reinforcer establishes a very
clear message of approval and provides us with a moment to deliver the primary reinforcer, the treat or toy.
CONTINUOUS AND INTERMITTENT SCHEDULES OF
REINFORCEMENT
Continuous reinforcement means that every time the
dog performs the behavior, he gets a positive reward.
When you begin training with your dog, use this schedule
until the dog understands what behavior you want him
to perform. Continuous reinforcement should be used
until your dog successfully responds to both the verbal
command and the hand signal in various scenarios, as
well as with distractions that increase
the difficulty of the task.
Once your dog is consistently and
successfully performing the desired
behavior, you can switch to an
intermittent (or varied) schedule, which
means that your dog is reinforced only
occasionally. For example, you could give
them a treat every other time they sit,
then every third time, then a couple
times in a row, etc.
This variation will help a behavior to ‘stick’ because
your dog will never know when a treat is coming, so
he’ll continue to work, in the hopes that the next time
will pay off.
(continued on next page

Why vary the reinforcement after your dog learns
a new command? A dog who has had continuous
reinforcement every single time he performs a
behavior, will quickly notice if the reinforcement
stops. He may try this behavior a few times, but if no
reinforcer is forthcoming, he’ll eventually stop trying
and this behavior becomes extinct. (continued on next page)

Here’s an example of a natural reinforcer: When
your dog wants to go outside, you ask him to sit and
wait by the door, before you will allow him to go out.
The natural reinforcer is that he will be rewarded by
going outside, where he will likely enjoy a walk or play
time. Eventually, your dog will automatically sit and wait
by the door, until you open it.

Giving rewards intermittently will make your dog want
the treats more and will continue to try, even if they
aren’t rewarded the first time they’ve successfully
performed the behavior.The will allow your dog to get
used to working even when there isn’t a reward.

DEFINITIONS OF OTHER COMMON TRAINING TERMS
LURING: To use a desired item (like a toy or treat) to
get a dog to move in a certain way by enticing them to
follow the item into a particular position or behavior.
For example: When teaching a dog to sit, put a treat
to your dog’s nose, then lift the treat over the dogs
head and his rear end will touch the ground. You’re
luring him into a sitting position with the treat.

Here’s an example of how intermittently rewarding
a dog will encourage them to keep trying: If you give
your dog a bite of your dinner once in a while, but in
between you say “no”, your dog will keep begging for
food. If you say “no” continuously, every single time,
they will eventually stop begging for food. But
rewarding them with food every once in while will keep
them trying for more in the hope that you might slip
them one more bite! Same thing with sleeping in your
bed or letting them jump on you – letting them do it
every once in while will keep them trying for more.
NATURAL REINFORCERS
Eventually, dogs will perform the behavior for natural
reinforcers, as well as the ones we have provided on
an intermittent schedule.

SHAPING: To break a desired behavior into smaller
parts and marking and rewarding these steps when
they happen. Shaping is especially useful in teaching
more complicated behaviors. For example: If you
wanted your dog to pick up your keys and hand them
to you, you would use shaping by marking and rewarding the dog just for sniffing the keys. Once your dog is
consistently sniffing the keys, wait for him to mouth
them, then reward that small step. Once he is mouthing
the keys consistently, only reward him for picking them
up with his mouth.

BAIT BAG
This is used to carry all of the “good stuff” like treats,
toys or whatever else might motivate the dog to want
to learn.There are bags made specifically to hold training
treats, or you can improvise a treat bag. The style of bag
can be as individual as the handler. A pocket can also be
used if the lingering smell of treats is not a problem!

TREATS
Treats can range from kibble to real meat, depending on
the level of distraction the dog and handler are experiencing during a training session. Using kibble for training
at home is usually good enough but out in the “real
world,” with real life distractions, the reinforcement will
need to be bumped up with treats that the dog thinks
are worth his attention.

A n i m A l fA r m

LEASHES
There are many leash options. Use a leash that is soft on
the hands and about six feet in length for non-reactive
dogs. A leash of four feet in length is best for a dog who
reacts to people or animals when out in public. The
shortened leash will allow the handler to help the dog
avoid bad experiences. Exercise caution with expandable
leashes, as they often give the handler much less control
of the dog, and can cause injury if the cable is grabbed in
an emergency. If dropped on the ground, the plastic expandable leash handle will bang behind the dogs and
could frighten even the bravest dog, which could result
in the dog running away.

No two dogs, or two human handlers, are alike. At Animal Farm Foundation, we treat every dog
and every handler as an individual. We use a variety of training tools to help each dog and each
handler have a positive, successful training experience that will promote the human-canine bond.

CLICKER
The clicker is used to mark the exact moment that a dog does the
“right” behavior and is followed by a treat. In place of the clicker, the
word “Yes” can be used, giving the handler one less thing to hold during
a training session.
FLAT BUCKLE COLLAR
Collars that display the dog’s name, phone number, rabies tag and any
required licensing are a must to ensure a dog’s safe return home. If using
a flat buckle collar for walking a large dog, it is safest to have a metal
buckle. Plastic closures can snap open if the dog pulls, leading to an
off-leash pooch. For large dogs or strong pullers, consider a sensation
harness or head halter for walking.
SENSATION HARNESS
The sensation harness is designed to clip in the front of the dog, at
the chest. It is meant to be comfortable for the dog to wear, as it takes
pressure off the dog’s neck. It also makes it easier for the dog to use
appropriate body language when he meets other dogs and people. The
sensation harness also gives the handler more control of the dog’s body
as the dog is steered from the shoulders.
HEAD HALTER
The head halter fits around the dog’s nose and back of the head. It is a
good piece of equipment for reactive dogs. It will give the handler better
control of the dog’s head, which translates to more control of the dog’s
entire body. A note of caution for this piece of equipment: For the
comfort, safety and success of the dog, the handler will need to fully
understand the proper use of the halter.
Training is a team effort and is most successful when the handler and
dog are enjoying each others company while working together. Use
training equipment that will promote a positive and pleasant experience
for the dog and a sense of accomplishment for the handler.

PlAYing tHe nAme gAme
AKA cookie toss!

HOW TO:
• Show your dog a treat.
• Toss it a short distance.
• Your dog will run to get it.
• Say his name right after he grabs it.
• When he turns to look at you, praise him, then
toss another treat in a different direction.
• Repeat this a few times.

TIPS:
Always use a happy tone of voice when calling your dog’s
name.
If your dog is not interested in the treats, try training
before meal time, when they’re hungrier, or using higher
value treats, such as chicken or cheese.

notHing in life iS free
AKA Say Please

Introduce NILF into your daily routines if your dog
is currently engaging in behaviors that are rude or pushy,
such as counter surfing, barking, whining, begging
for food, pushing or grabbing items, nudging you for
attention, digging, etc.
In addition to your training sessions, using NILF will help
establish the house rules for your dog, whether they’re
a new addition to your family or just in need a refresher
course.
HOW TO:
• First, spend some time teaching your dog basic
commands, such as “sit” and “down”.
• Once your dog knows how to sit, you can
introduce NILF.
• Whenever your dog wants or needs something,
they must sit first.
For example:
At dinner time, ask your dog to sit, and then give them
their food bowl.
When your dog wants to go for a walk, ask them to sit,
and then put on their leash.
• As you teach your dog other commands, you can
incorporate them into the NILF program, by increasing
the difficulty of your requests.

If your dog wants a treat, put him in a sit-stay, take a few

If your dog nudges you to pet him, ask for a down, and
then give him affection.
Incorporating basic training into everyday scenarios like
these will remind your dog that polite manners are the
key to getting the good things in life!

t r A i n i n g

THE PROGRAM: Nothing in Life is Free (NILF) helps dogs acquire better manners by teaching them
that in order to get what they want, they must behave politely. In other words, nothing in life comes
for free. Dogs have to earn things they want with polite behavior, just like we do when we say “please”!

Sit And Sit StAY

HOW TO:
• Grasp a treat with your thumb and pointer finger,
like you’re pinching something.
• Hold the treat close to your dog’s nose.
• Move the treat slowly up over his nose, so that
his head tilts up to follow the treat.
• As his head and snout raise up, his rear end will
naturally move down to the floor.
• When your dog’s rear end touches the floor, mark
the behavior with “yes” and then give him the
treat.
• Once your dog repeatedly succeeds at the behavior,
you can add the verbal command “sit”, as you pass
the treat in front of your dog.
Tips and Troubleshooting:
Pick a quiet spot to practice, free of distractions.
If your dog jumps up to grab the treat, you’re holding it
too far away from his nose. Try keeping the treat no
more than one inch from his nose.

If your dog backs up, instead of sitting, try moving him to
a spot with a wall behind him, so that he can’t back away.
Only say the command “sit” once. Wait until your dog
gives you the behavior (be patient!) and then mark with
“yes” and a treat.

SIT
The Command: “Sit” means to sit, a comfortable position
for most dogs, and often the first command a dog learns.

Adding Hand Signals:
• The hand signal for “sit” mimics the movement
you used to teach them to sit: pass your (empty)
hand over their head and then back up towards
your shoulder, as you say “sit”. Imagine you’re
doing an exaggerated bicep curl.
• As soon as your dog sits, mark the behavior
with a “yes” and reward them with a treat from
your other hand.

SIT — STAY
The Command: “Sit – Stay” means to sit and stay in
place, until released. This can be used in everyday situations, both on and off leash.
HOW TO
• Begin with your dog in a sit.
• Hold treats in your left hand, but do not let your
dog see them.
• Give the stay signal with your right hand (use a
flat, outreached hand, like a traffic cop signaling
you to ‘stop’) and at the same time say “Stay”.
• Silently count two beats. Don’t move away. After
two seconds, give the treat.
• After the task is completed say ‘yes’ and
immediately give your dog the food reward
from your left hand.
• Release your dog by saying “ok!” or “free”. This
tells them that the “stay” is over.
• As long as your dog is successful, continue to
add on time and, eventually distance to their
sit-stays.
• Use the sit-stay checklist to gradually increase
the difficulty. Aim for your dog to complete
about a dozen successful repetitions before
moving onto the next step.

Tips and Troubleshooting:
Begin practicing sit-stay on leash or in the house. As
your dog builds their skill level, move outside where
there are more distractions. If you have an enclosed
area outside, you can practice off leash, but if not, try
using a long nylon training lead, so you can increase the
distance safely.
If your dog gets up as you try to extend the length of
the sit stay, return to the last length of time your dog
was successfully able to stay sitting and then build up
slowly from that point.
As you go through the sit stay checklist, your dog may
move or follow you. If that happens, walk him back
where he was originally sitting, then try again, making
it slightly easier this time. Always set your dog up for
success, so he’ll enjoy your training sessions!

HOW TO:
• Put your dog in a sit (see sit-stay handout)
• Put a treat in your right hand and hold it close
enough to your dog’s face so that he can smell it,
but not eat it.
• Pass the treat straight down from your dog’s nose
to the floor in between his front paws, then
straight out in front of him. This looks like an
‘L’ motion.
• When your dog lies down mark the behavior with
a “yes” and give the treat.
• Once your dog repeatedly succeeds at the behavior,
you can add the verbal command “down”, as you
pass the treat in front of your dog.

When luring your dog into a down with the ‘L’ motion,
make sure the treat is kept very close to your dog as you
move it to the floor. He will follow it down with his head
and then, as you draw it out slowly in front of him, he
should stretch and lie down to follow the treat. If the
treat is too far away from your dog as you lower it, or
you move it across the floor too quickly, your dog may
pop up to follow the food.

Tips and Troubleshooting:

THE COMMAND: “Down” means to lie down. To avoid confusion, refrain from using “down’” when
your dog jumps on you (or on furniture). In those situations use the command “off” instead.

Small dogs may take a little longer to learn the down,
but keep trying and use high value treats to keep them
interested.You can also try placing them on a table and
practice “down” on an elevated surface.
Not having any luck? Try sitting on the floor with your
feet flat on the ground, knees raised. Lure your dog
under your legs with a treat. They’ll have to lie down
under your raised knees to get the treat. Mark the
behavior with a “yes” and “down”.
If your dog refuses to lie down, try capturing the
desired behavior whenever your dog naturally lies
down by marking the behavior with a “yes” and
“down”.
ADDING HAND SIGNALS
• There are two hand signals commonly used for
down. Choose one and use it every time you
ask your dog to down.
• The first mimics the movement you used to
teach the down: pass your (empty) hand down
to the floor as you say “down” (see photo).
• The other option: extend your arm vertically, at
a slight angle, as you say “down”. Imagine you’re
reaching for an item on a shelf above your head,
with a flat, empty hand.
• As soon as your dog lies down, mark the behavior
with a “yes” and reward them with a treat from
your other hand.

Tips:
The second hand signal is useful if you need to put your
dog in a down from a distance. They might not be able
to hear you saying “down”, but they’ll be able to see
your arm reaching up from across a field or dog park.
Once they are successful at “down”, you can move on
to practicing “down-stay” (see our down-stay handout for
more).

doWn StAY

HOW TO:
• Once your dog lies down readily, stop giving treats
for only doing the down.
• Next, choose a consistent hand signal to use. Try
a flat, outreached hand (imagine a traffic cop
signaling you to ‘stop’ like in the photo).
• Now put your dog in a down.
• Ask him/her to “stay” while using the stay hand
signal, then silently count to five. Do not move
away from your dog. After five seconds, give
the treat.
• Release your dog by saying “ok!” or “free”. This
tells them that the “stay” is over.
• Once they can stay for five, repeat and count ten.
• Add on an additional five seconds, as long as your
dog in successful.
• Once your dog is staying for a length of time, you
can begin to move away from your dog. See the
sit-stay program for more details on creating
distance using stays.
Tips and Troubleshooting:
To make staying easier, try teaching your dog a “relaxed
down” first. A relaxed down is when the dog, already
lying down, shifts onto one hip to be more comfortable.
Some dogs do this naturally.

pass the treat from their nose to their hip in a semi-circle. When he shifts his weight onto the hip, say “relax”
and give the treat. Now you have a relaxed down.

If your dog gets up as you try to extend the length of
the down stay or relaxed down stay, return to the last
length of time your dog was successfully able to stay in
the down and then build up slowly from that point.
Once you add distance and movement into the down
stay, your dog may get up to follow you. In that case, walk
him back where he was originally lying down, then try
again, making it slightly easier this time. Always set your
dog up for success, so he’ll enjoy your training sessions!

THE COMMAND: “Down Stay” Once your dog learns the down, teach them to stay down for any
period of time.

Tips and Troubleshooting:
Why do dogs jump? To demonstrate affection, to be
closer to our faces, and to get attention from us. When
a dog is jumping up, they are demonstrating affection by
trying to lick your mouth. As puppies, dogs learn that
this gesture is a deferential and loving way to greet a
superior.
When your dog is jumping up, they’re giving you a
compliment and hoping you’ll pay attention to them! The
more upset you become, the more your dog will want

THE COMMAND: “Off “ means to get off of a person or an item of furniture. To avoid confusion,
refrain from using “down” when your dog jumps on you (or on furniture).
HOW TO:
• When your dog jumps on you, stay calm and
quiet. Do not react in any way.
• Turn to the side with your hands behind your
back, allowing your body motion to gently
displace your dog.
• As you move, say firmly and quietly “Off”.
• As soon as your dog’s feet are on the floor, ask
for a sit.
• If your dog sits, kneel down by her side and praise.
• This teaches your dog that they will get attention
and praise when they are sitting, not jumping.
• Soon you’ll anticipate that your dog is about to
jump and you can step to the side, before they
make contact with you.This surprise motion from
you will cause your dog to pause.
• The final step is to anticipate that your dog is
about to jump and, before they do, ask them to
sit instead.You’ll set your dog up for success!

to appease you and show you much they love you
by jumping up again. Rather than punish your dog
for trying to greet you, teach your dog appropriate
behavior using the steps above.
Do not push your dog with your hands or speak to
them in an excited tone. Your dog might mistake your
actions for play. Stay calm and quiet. Don’t give them
any attention until they have all four paws on the floor.
*Note: You may have heard of other, more physical,
techniques (kneeing them in the chest, stepping on their
back paws, or squeezing their front paws) that punish dogs
for jumping. These methods will likely teach your dog to
fear you and/or strangers, but won’t teach them how to
politely meet people.

droP it or out

HOW TO:
Try the proactive approach: whenever your dog has
something in his mouth, use it as an opportunity to train
“Drop It” by following these steps:
• Grab a treat in your left hand, but don’t let your
dog see the treat.
• Put your right hand in front of your dog’s mouth
or, if the object is large, put your hand on the object.
• Use your left hand to pop the treat directly into
your dog’s mouth, behind the object. As you do
this, say “Drop it”.
• Your dog will feel the treat in his mouth and,
wanting to chew it, he’ll spit the object out into
your hand.Your dog will be instantly rewarded
with a treat that’s already in his mouth!
• Practice this technique often.
• Not only will your dog learn “drop it”, but he’ll
look forward to having your hands near his
mouth, because he’ll never know when to expect
a surprise treat.
Tips and Troubleshooting:
Dogs are naturally inclined to explore the world with
their mouths.They investigate by tasting (and sometimes
eating) everything. This goes for appropriate things, like
toys and treats, as well as potentially dangerous items,
and even our favorite shoes.

To set dogs up for success, remove items that are dangerous or valuable from their reach by putting them in
closets and cabinets. Manage their environment so that
they do not have access to expensive sweaters or poisonous chemicals and you’ll prevent them from making
a bad decision.

Playing tug, grabbing at the item, or scolding and chasing
them will lead dogs to believe you’re playing a game and
encourages them to play “keep away” with the item. If
your dog does get a hold of an item you want them to
drop, stay calm and trade the item for a treat, using the
“out” technique.You can also hold a treat directly in front
of their nose.
If your dog displays behaviors such as resource guarding,
please consult a professional for help prior to using these
training handouts.

t r A i n i n g

THE COMMAND: “Drop It” means to drop whatever object is in their mouth.

leAVe it

Tips and Troubleshooting:
In the beginning, your dog does not have to move her
entire head away from your hand in order to get the
reward. The instant her eyes look away from your hand,
breaking attention from the treat, you can reward
your dog.

HOW TO:
• Ask your dog to sit.
• Show your dog a treat.
• Place the treat in the palm of your right hand, then
close your hand around it.
• Put your closed fist in front of your dog’s nose
and let her sniff your hand.
• Your dog will begin to nose, lick, paw, or mouth
your right hand.
• In a quiet voice say “leave it”.
• The moment your dog looks away from your
hand, mark the behavior with a “yes”, then give
the dog a treat from your left hand while saying
“take it”.
• Repeat this several times.
• Your dog will quickly figure out that they get re
warded for looking away.
• With practice, when you say “leave it” your dog
will begin to turn her head away or move away
from the treat.
• After they master the behavior, switch the treat
into your left hand and repeat.

When giving the reward from your left hand, say “take
it” in a cheery voice.
To make it easier for your dog to succeed, you can use a
less exciting treat (like a baked biscuit) in your right hand
and reward her with a high value treat (chicken) from
your left.

t r A i n i n g

THE COMMAND: “Leave it” means to leave an object or an animal alone. This command is helpful
in countless situations, such as asking your dog to avoid food you’ve dropped, trash on the street,
or other dogs and people.

Increasing Difficulty:
• Open Hand: Show your dog the treat. Leave
your hand open, instead of making a fist.
• Repeat the steps above.
• If your dog tries to take the treat, close your
palm into a fist, say “leave it”, then return to
practicing with a closed fist. Once they’ve had
multiple successful repetitions with a closed fist,
try with an open hand again.
• On the Floor: After your dog masters “leave it”
with an open hand, you can then place the treat
on the floor.
• Ask your dog to sit.
• Place treat on the floor, then move your foot
over the treat with your weight on your heel.
• Swing your foot to the side to reveal the treat
to your dog.
• Tell them to “leave it”.
• If your dog attempts to take it, swing your foot
back over the treat to block them.
• When they look away, reward them with a treat
from your hand.
• After they master this behavior, increase the
challenge by taking a few steps away from the
treat.
• As you move away, say “leave it” and, when your
dog succeeds, reward them with a treat from
your hand while saying “take it.”

Tips and Troubleshooting:
Use your foot to block the treat on the floor, rather
than bending down to cover the treat with your hand.
Your dog is fast and will get to the treat before you
get your hands to the floor! Since accidents happen,
your dog might get the treat from the floor. If that
happens, say “oops” and start again.
If your dog is successful at each interval, have some fun
with this command! Try this: Have your dog lie down.
Place a treat on their paw and ask them to leave it.
If they ignore the treat on their paw, give them a
reward from your hand while saying “take it.” If they
can do this, try putting the treat on their nose or
forehead.Tell them to “leave it” until you release them
with “take it.” Bonus points if your dog can flip the
treat into their mouth!

HOW TO:
Ask your dog to sit.
• Slowly lower the food bowl towards the floor.
• If your dog moves forward, towards the food,
stand up with the food bowl.
• Try again.
• Put the food bowl all the way on the floor only
when your dog remains sitting and is giving you
eye contact.
• Release your dog (say “ok” or “free”), so he
knows it’s ok to move and eat now.
• Once the dog is reliably waiting, add the verbal
command “Wait”.

NEXT STEP:
Doors and Gates:
• Approach the door or gate with your dog beside
you.
• Ask your dog to Wait.
• Begin opening the door slowly.
• If your dog makes a move towards the door,
quickly close the door.
• Start again and, each time your dog makes the
slightest moves towards the door, close it.
• When your dog is no longer moving forward
towards the door, reinforce the waiting with
a “yes”.
• Once your dog is waiting for a few seconds in a
row, step through the door.
• Make sure your dog is looking at you, then release
him the cue “Let’s go.”
• If he follows you before you release him, step back
in and start again.
(continued on next page)

t r A i n i n g

THE COMMAND: “Wait” means to pause until further instructions are given. Wait is different from
“Stay”. Stay means that a dog must remain sitting or lying down until you return and release them.
Wait means that your dog must stop for a moment, like when you put on a leash or exit the house.

On a Walk:
• When you come to a curb ask your dog to
Wait.
• Reinforce the dog for waiting and giving you eye
contact.
• When you are ready to move say “lets go”.
Practice in the Yard:
• Put the dog on a long line.
• Let him walk a few feet away and then ask him
to Wait.
• When he pauses and looks at you, mark and re
inforce by tossing a treat to him.
• Practice on leash until the dog is reliably per
forming a Wait.
• Take the dog to a secure yard and do the same
exercise without the leash.
Tips and Troubleshooting:
While working at the door, try small steps, gradually
opening the door wider and wider. Start by opening
the a couple of inches, then feet, increasing until the
door is all the way open. Repeat exercise in different
directions, in different buildings, and with different
types of doors.
For crates and cars, ask your dog to sit or lie down
before opening the door. If the dog is standing, they are
more likely to charge out the door. Release him with
“ok” or “free” if you are allowing him to walk out or
“lets go” if you are leashing him up to move with you.

FOR SHELTERS:
Kennels:
• Approach the kennel.
• Wait for the dog to move to a spot that is away
from the kennel door. When they do, mark the
desired behavior with a click or a “yes”.
• Place your foot on the bottom of the kennel
door and start pushing it open.
• As you push the door open, continue
reinforcing the dog for holding his spot with
“yes” or a click.
• If the dog moves toward the door, step back
and close the door.
• Start over.
• Continue this process until you can enter the
kennel and put the dog’s leash on while he is
waiting away from the door.
• Wait for the dog to make eye contact with you
before releasing him.
• Release him by saying “let’s go” and moving
forward together.
• Once the dog has an understanding of the
exercise, add the cue “Wait”, before entering
the kennel.

THE CORRECT POSITION:
The dog should be on your left. The dog’s body should
be straight and heading in the same direction you. The
dog’s head may be turned in slightly to look up at your
face. When you stop moving the dog should automatically sit on the left side, facing in the same direction as
the handler.

www.animalfarmfoundation.org

HOW TO:
• Start with the dog sitting next to you, on your left
side.
• Have a food lure in your left hand, near his nose,
so he is aware of the reward.
• Begin walking briskly, moving forward with your
left leg, in a straight line.
• Engage your dog while in motion and, with
enthusiasm, mark with “yes” and reward with the
lure, when they are in the correct position.
• Stop abruptly and lure the dog into a sit, his body
straight, facing the same direction as you. When
his head is turned towards you, give him the reward.
• Continue walking and stopping at random
intervals. Mark and reward the dog for walking
and sitting in the correct positions. Practice short
intervals of sit, walk, sit in the heel position.
• Once they are reliably walking and sitting in the
correct position, add in the verbal command,
“Heel” when you begin to walk or when you stop
for a sit.
• Next, practice making left and right turns. Turn as
if you did not have a dog with you, so that the dog
needs to compensate and follow your movements.
(continued on next page)

t r A i n i n g

THE COMMAND: “Heel”, a formal cue, means to walk next to you at the same pace, with the dog’s
shoulders in line with your knee. Heel is different than loose leash walking. Heel provides a clear
place for your dog to be, which is helpful for dogs that are reactive or in busy settings in which
you need better control of your dog.

Tips and Troubleshooting:
Be careful to deliver reinforcement only when the dog
is in the correct position. Do not reinforce, verbally or
with treats, when the dog’s rib cage is in front of your
knee (called “forging”) or his head is just even or
behind your leg (called “lagging”).
Be aware of your own body. While walking, you should
be facing ahead, with your shoulders forward and
glancing out of the corner of your eye to watch the
dog. Do not turn to look at the dog as this will force
the dog to lag behind you.
If you walk too slowly, your dog will lose interest and
begin to move left or right. Initially, keep your pace
brisk, so your dog is engaged and keeping pace.
If the dog is out of place, use a “sit” to help them regain
the correct position next to you. Once your dog has
regained the correct position, face forward and walk
briskly in a straight line for a short distance. Stop and
ask your dog to “sit” again.

fAding lureS

be for them to respond to a verbal cue alone. In the case
of food lures, you wind up bribing, rather than training
your dog.
There are different reasons for the necessity of fading
food lures and hand signals, but the most practical
reasons for doing so are: you won’t always have food with
you and your hands won’t always be free to gesture.
Teaching your dog to listen to a verbal cue alone
provides more security in a variety of situations.

HOW TO FADE THE FOOD LURE:
• Once you are reliably getting the behavior that
you desire (such as sitting) with the food lure and
hand gesture, you can begin to fade the visual
presence of the food.
• Leave the treat in your pocket or in your other
hand, then move your empty hand exactly as you
did before.
• When the dog responds with the correct behavior,
mark with a “yes” or a click, then deliver the food
reward from your other hand.

A n i m A l fA r m

foundAtion, inc.

www.animalfarmfoundation.org

HOW TO FADE THE HAND SIGNAL:
• Add the verbal cue once the behavior is reliably
occurring ninety percent of the time with the
hand gesture. The verbal cue should be given just
before the hand gesture.
• After using the verbal cue and hand gesture
successfully, just use the verbal cue.
(continued on next page)

t r A i n i n g

Why Fade? Lures and prompts are excellent tools for helping dogs to understand what we are attempting to teach them. Luring a dog with food helps them interpret what we are asking them to
do. However, the longer you continue to use lures and prompts, after your dog has already learned
the new behavior, the more dependent upon them your dog becomes and the more difficult it will

• The dog will likely pause. Wait until he does
what you have asked. Let him think it out.
• When the dog performs the behavior, mark
with a “yes” and reward with a treat.
• Repeat a couple of times and end your training
session with the goal of getting rid of hand
signals in the next session.
Tips and Troubleshooting:
It’s helpful to understand the difference between a
reward and a bribe. When you ask your dog to
perform a task that they have proven to know and they
do it, giving them a treat afterwards is a reward and a
reinforcement. If you ask your dog to sit, something
they know how to do, and they do not do it until you
lure them with food, it is a bribe. Teaching them to
work, without luring them into position with food,
teaches them that they must complete the task before
earning the reward.
If possible, food lures should be removed in the first
training session of a new command. If the behavior is
more complicated or if the dog is young, try removing
the food lures by the second or third training session.
When fading the hand signal, if the dog doesn’t do the
behavior, help him out by repeating the hand gesture a
few more times.

If progress is slow, try these intermediate steps:
Give the verbal cue, then wait a bit longer to give the
hand signal. Allow them a few beats to think it out on
their own, before prompting with the hand signal.
You can also fade the gesture gradually by modifying
the amount of movement in your hand signal. For
example, if you typically move your whole arm up when
signaling your dog to sit, you would gradually decrease
the gesture until you are only moving your hand
upwards. Once they are reliably providing the behavior,
try fading that modified hand signal all together.

THE DACHSHUND CLUB OF AMERICA HANDBOOK ON

THE DACHSHUND
PREFACE This booklet is made possible by combining the previous work done for DCA by Dee Hutchinson’s “The Dachshund Club of America, Inc. Handbook” and Judy Goulder’s, “The Dachshund”. This booklet is for the novice Dachshund owner to use as a guide, to assist in general care, grooming, training, and to keep your dog happy and healthy for many years. Your dog’s breeder, or a knowledgeable breeder in your area, should be able to provide more detailed grooming and training techniques and information.

THE DACHSHUND CLUB OF AMERICA, INC. The Dachshund Club of America (DCA) is one of the oldest breed club members in the American Kennel Club, elected to membership in 1895. Only eight other breed clubs have greater longevity. In 1934, the Dachshund Club of America presented its first single breed specialty show, held in New York City. The judge was Mrs. C. Davies Tainter and there were 204 Dachshunds entered. Between the years 1936-1941, the DCA specialties were held at the Morris & Essex Show in New Jersey. Since 1960, the DCA Parent Specialty has moved around the country using a regional schedule – East coast, West coast, Midwest, Southwest, Southeast, Northwest and Northeast. The National Specialties have an average entry of 400 dogs. With over 1,200 members, the Dachshund Club of America is an active, viable organization. There are few areas of interest that DCA is not involved or interested in. DCA is financially supportive of medical research on behalf of the dachshund. Many research projects are ongoing: disc disease and progressive retinal atrophy are only a couple of the areas to which DCA has contributed both financially and with member participation in these studies. DCA provides bronze plaques, medallions, and gold plated pins as prizes at Parent and Regional Specialty shows, as well as Field Trials and Obedience Trials. DCA also recognizes the versatility of our breed by awarding Versatility Certificates. This certificate is awarded only to dachshunds that perform meritoriously in multiple areas: Conformation, Obedience, Field, Earthdog, Agility, Rally and Canine Good Citizen. DCA also publishes a quarterly Newsletter for its members that are also available to the dachshund loving public through subscription. The Newsletter provides a forum for articles, interviews, show results and kennel advertising. Information regarding the Dachshund Club of America, Inc can also be found on their web site at www.dachshund-dca.org.

There are over 50 active Dachshund Regional Specialty shows across the United States. Through our secretary or our website, www.dachshunddca.org, we are able to refer you to a dachshund club in your region/area. These clubs, in turn, can refer you to reputable members who have animals available for sale or can just answer your questions on the breed. HISTORY OF THE DACHSHUND It is difficult to say exactly where the dachshund as a specific breed originated. There are as many different opinions as there are experts on the breed. Traditionally, the dachshund is thought of as a German dog, since his name translate into “badger dog”. There is little doubt that the Germans are responsible for considerable improvement in the breed and that they have done much to further his capabilities. It seems reasonable to assume that dachshunds are descended from the basset hound. Early breeders, being desirous of a smaller dog that could “go to ground”, used a breeding program that helped the dachshund evolve into the breed which we recognize today. Whatever his earlier origins, it is to the Germans that we look for specific records. In 1840, there were 54 dachshunds registered in the all-breed studbook in Germany. In 1879, the first standard for the dachshund breed was written. It is amazing how few changes have been made in the standard since that time. Lieutenant Ligner, the first president of that organization, formed the Berlin Teckelclub in 1888. The first studbook devoted solely to dachshunds was published in 1890 with 394 dachshunds registered. If one chooses, one could trace present-day pedigrees back to famous foreign kennels whose dogs were imported into the United States: von Lichtenstein, von Luitpoldsheim, Asbeck, Flottenberg, Lindenbuhl, Falltor and Holtzgarten. The first dachshunds brought into the United States were Caesar and Minka, imported in 1887. They were the first of many. From 1887 until the beginning of World War I, there was a steady stream of dachshund into this country. With the advent of the war and the resulting hysteria over anything “German”, the dachshund lost much popularity and German breeding and breeding stock became almost non-existent. Under the capable guidance of a few dedicated individuals, dachshund
–3–

breeding was reestablished in the United States. World War II again brought disaster to German breeders. However, by then American breeders were well established and the popularity of the dachshund continued to increase. Today, the dachshund is consistently among the top ten most popular breed in terms of AKC registrations. The smooth and the longhair varieties have coexisted for centuries and were even bred back and forth [although this is not common practice today]. The wirehair is the more recent of the varieties, produced to fill the need for a coat resistant to more extreme conditions. WHY A DACHSHUND? There are 153 different breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club. What is there about the Dachshund that makes him so desirable? First, it is his versatility. The dachshund comes in two sizes (standard and miniature) and three different coats (smooth, longhair and wirehair), so no matter what area of the country you live, there is a dachshund to fit your environment. The dachshund us quite intelligent, but he does have a mind of his own. He responds well to training, although his innate stubborn streak may sometimes exhibit itself. If you want a challenge, train your dachshund in obedience work. As a sporting dog, he has an excellent nose for trailing and his disposition and conformation contribute to his skill as an underground worker. He is agile, persistent, and has exceptional hunting instincts. He is particularly well adapted to working rabbits. Around young children, the dachshund is a splendid choice. He is dedicated and protective as well as affectionate and playful. His size, cleanliness, and lack of “doggy” odor are characteristics that please the woman of the house. Dachshunds are alert watchdogs. They will loudly proclaim the approach of any stranger. The dachshund is easy to love, but he gives much more than he gets. He is courageous to the point of rashness. His delightful antics will provide you with hours of pleasure.
–4–

Without a doubt, the dachshund will be a clever, playful and lively addition to your family. WHY BUY FROM A BREEDER? Some years ago, researchers at McGill University in Montreal found that the home raised animals are both physically and psychologically superior to caged animals and have remarkably fewer behavior problems. Therefore, a reliable show breeder is preferable to a pet shop (or puppy mill) when searching for your dachshund. Pet shops and puppy mills are profit oriented. They do not consider improving the breed and puppies are turned out on a production line basis at the lowest possible cost. This means that the animals are caged and minimum expenditures are made for both health care and nutrition. Breeders, on the other hand, are dog lovers. Dachshund show breeders strive to produce dogs that most closely approach the ideal described in the standard. More often than not, these litters are raised in their homes and are accustomed to a loving family life before they are ready to go to their new homes. Breeders are happy to give a reasonable health guarantee knowing they have given their pups the benefit of good nutrition and necessary veterinary care. Most of the puppies produced by breeders are not destined to become show dogs but they do possess the character, personality and body type described for the breed. Puppies purchased from show breeders are soon welcome and loved members of the family. CHOOSING A PUPPY No one can guarantee champions, for that would require the ability to look into the future. Much of a grown dog’s good qualities, no matter how well bred or raised before you became its owner, will disappear if one does not continue with proper nutrition and health care. Most potential buyers want a 6 to 8 week old puppy. Most reliable breeders will not part with a puppy that young for good reasons. At 12 weeks, the puppies are more independent, having been away from their moth–5–

er for a longer period of time. At 12 weeks, they tend to be attentive to training in general and ready to be house-trained. The younger puppy cannot control himself well. The 12-week-old puppy will have had inoculations that are so important to his adult well-being. At this age, he is ready to bond with his new owners with all the love his little body can produce. Decide first what size and variety you want. If there are young children in the family, a standard might be a better choice. Do not be deterred by the size of the puppy. The big, happy, floppy puppy may grow up to be a coarse adult, while the smallest in the litter may turn out to be the better dog. Usually it is wise to choose the puppy that comes to you. The little one that sits back in the corner may just being quiet and shy or have been bullied by siblings. You do not want a shy puppy. When you pick up the puppy, he should feel hard and firm in your hands, He should have good, heavy bone. If he does not have it at three months, he won’t have it later. He should have straight front legs and a strong square rear. Check the puppy’s bite: the dachshund should have a “scissors” bite in which the inside of the top teeth touch the outside of the bottom teeth. Look for a puppy with a dark brown or black eye, the darker the better. A light eye or light nose is not desirable. The pigmentation on the nose should be black in most cases. When you have made your choice, ask the breeder for a pedigree (it should be a minimum of three generations) and the puppy’s AKC registration certificate. Sometimes the certificate is not yet available. In that case, get the names of the sire and dam, their AKC registration numbers, the litter application number and the date the litter was whelped. It is also a good idea to get in writing what inoculations have been given and when, as well as what the puppy has been eating. It is not wise to change a puppy’s diet too abruptly. Then, take your puppy home and begin a wonderful relationship!

–6–

VETERINARY CARE In addition to visits for illness and emergencies, all dogs should be seen by a veterinarian on a regular basis for periodic check-ups, control of parasites and immunization against all serious illness. Almost every dog has worms at one time or another. This should not be a bad reflection on the breeder in the case of puppies but the problem does need to be resolved. Some worms are virtually unavoidable. Round worms are the most common and can sometimes be seen in feces. However, other and more dangerous worms can be present which are only detectable with the aid of a microscope. Examinations of stool samples should be part of a program of regular veterinary care. If detected early and treated properly, most intestinal parasites can be controlled or eliminated without great difficulty. In many areas, heartworm, a parasite carried by mosquito’s, is prevalent. Let your veterinarian set up a program for prevention. Heartworm is difficult to treat, especially in older dogs. Most worm medications are specific for one type of parasite and not be used indiscriminately. Worm medications are toxic…enough to kill worms while not enough to kill the dog. Follow your veterinarian’s advice to the letter. Fleas, ticks and other external parasites can be controlled with any number of preparations available through your veterinarian. It is no shame for your dogs to catch fleas but there is no excuse for these parasites setting up housekeeping there. Your veterinarian can recommend the best remedy. Before weaning, puppies get immunity to many serious diseases through their mother’s milk. After weaning, this immunity rapidly disappears. The breeder of the litter will provide you with all information about the puppy’s inoculations and worming. Early inoculations only give temporary immunity to disease. Follow your veterinarian’s advice on gaining permanent immunity to canine distemper, hepatitis, and leptospirosis. This will involve a series of vaccinations between 12 and 15 weeks of age and an annual booster thereafter. [More recent studies indicate that annual boosters may not be necessary in older dog. Discuss the medical routine best suited for your pet with your veterinarian.2006] Your veterinarian will also suggest the best time for rabies vaccination, which is also required for licensing.

NUTRITION This is such an important part of your dogs overall state of health and contribution to his longevity, please consult with your breeder and veterinarian for their guidance and recommendations. Dogs require at least forty-three nutrients in very specific ratios for ideal nutrition. Almost all dog foods sold today are better for your dog than table scraps and are more economical than anything you might prepare. Major dog food companies follow strict guidelines based on extensive research to produce nutritionally sound products. Nutritional deficits can be found with owners who indulge their pets with inadequate foods or over-diligent owners who add supplements to carefully formulated commercial diets thereby disturbing the balance. A product labeled complete and balanced from a reputable manufacturer and plenty of fresh water is the best approach to feeding your dog. The method of feeding most widely used is the portion feeding method. Self-feeding method may also be preferred by some owners. In either case, follow the recommendations of the breeder when a puppy leaves the litter for his new home. Then gradually make a transition to any other complete and balanced food you select and the method of feeding you prefer. The newly weaned puppy should be fed quite moist food and it should be served four times a day. A good rule of thumb for feeding is 1 ounce of food per pound of body weight per day. At three months of age, the food can be drier and crunchier and three meals per day should be sufficient. The five to seven month old, or adolescent, puppy needs two meals a day; at ten months to a year, physical maturity, one feeding a day will do. With the self-feeding method, food at the proper consistency is left before him at all times with plenty of clean fresh water so that he may eat at will. This method has many advantages in that it cuts down on preparation time, eliminated the need to meet a feeding schedule and may even save a rug or chair leg by being reduced by the dog’s boredom. Most animals raised with this method will not eat more than the amount needed to meet caloric needs. For the dog fed with the traditional portion feeding method and the dog that cannot adjust to the self-feeding, the responsibility for monitoring weight falls to the owner. Every dog has its own nutritional needs and

one may be “roly-poly” on the same amount that might leave another a “rack of bones”. Seldom is undernourishment a problem with the conscientious dog owner. There are certain stress conditions such as puppyhood, pregnancy and nursing, hard work and cold weather, which will cause a nutritional need for a higher protein and greater caloric intake. Dramatic increases in protein can lead to problems in the urinary tract. The dietary problem that is found most often in dogs is obesity. Although fat puppies are cute, too much weight can adversely affect normal growth and development. Obesity in the dog has been shown to lower resistance to viral and bacterial infection, impair cardiac function, increase susceptibility to skin conditions and is associated with reproductive problems as well as shortened life span. Watch your dog’s profile. Adjust the quantity of his rations to keep him trim and healthy. It is much easier to fatten a thin dog than it is to slenderize a “fatty”. A report from Ralston Purina by Robert Mohrman of Pet Nutrition and Care research states that a twenty percent reduction in calorie intake will encourage a good rate of weight reduction in the obese Dachshund depending on the severity of the condition and the advice of your veterinarian. Special prescription diets are available for dogs with special nutritional needs due to kidney, heart or liver disease, obesity and even allergies. Your veterinarian can advise you best on any special dietary needs your dog might have. EXERCISE Every dog needs to exercise to maintain good health and muscle tone. Provide your Dachshund with an outdoor area safely enclosed where he can move about freely and enjoy the fresh air and sunshine. See that he has fresh water and a shelter where he can get out of the sun or wind. Most Dachshunds are hardy and can go out in all weather. However, your dog should not be made to stay out in extreme cold or heat. Your Dachshund should have some controlled exercise on a leash as well. A good working trot to see new places and people will benefit him both mentally and physically as well as offering some benefits to the person on the other end of the leash.

KENNELING AND THE CRATE METHOD OF HOUSEKEEPING Every dog should have a place of his own where he can retreat for undisturbed rest while feeling safe and secure. This is especially important for the new puppy. An airline create or folding metal rate will feel this need nicely and, in addition, will give you a nice useful tool in housetraining. There are those who feel crating a dog is cruel. On the contrary, any dog will seek a secluded and protected nook for his place of rest. You will be doing your puppy a favor by providing him with a place where he can feel snug and safe. To housebreak your dog effectively you must follow a routine for at least two weeks. Before you retire in the evening, take your puppy out and turn him loose in his exercise yard. He will feel less restricted off leash. If he does his duties, praise him and return him to his crate indoors. His natural instincts will tell him to keep is quarters clean. The very first thing in the morning, carry him to his exercise yard. He should respond quickly since he has held it all night. More praise and back indoors for free run of the room where you will be - -not the whole house. Enjoy each other’s company for a while and then give him breakfast. As soon as his last bite is gone, take him outside again. Again, praise for the right behavior and return him indoors to his crate for a couple of hours while you go about your usual routine. Towards noon, take him out of the crate and back to the exercise yard. More praise and in the house for some freedom in the room where you will be then back to his crate for awhile. The same routine is repeated for his noon meal and supper. Remember, put him outside as soon as he has finished the last mouthful. Give him free run of the room where you are during the evening with a quick trip out at 8:30pm or so and again just before bed. Preventing your pup from doing his duties indoors and praising his relieving himself outside, good habits will be fairly firm in a couple of weeks. As you feel these habits are more and more firmly established, allow your pup longer periods of freedom and introduce him to other rooms. Should he have an accident during these periods of freedom, a loud “NO!” followed by a quick and unceremonious trip to the exercise yard will refresh his memory. You will probably, after a few days, notice that your pup retreats to his crate on his own during periods of freedom. Great! A dog who will stay

TOYS FOR CHEWING Puppies need something to chew while cutting teeth. Older dogs also need something to chew for aid in teeth cleaning and sometimes to relieve or prevent boredom. In order ro prevent the destruction of furniture, rugs and other possessions, you must provide your dog with something suitable on which he can chew. The first thought is bones. Six-inch lengths of round beef shin bones are the only safe natural bones since all others can be broken or splintered and swallowed. Sharp pieces may pierce the intestine, cause blockage and upset digestion and, if not detected early, may even cause death. Plastic and rubber toys are easily reduced to pieces by most puppies and dogs. If swallowed, these pieces can be as lethal as breakable bones. There are, however, rubber toys which as virtually indestructible. Please be sure to check the labels and consumer reports. Also available in pet supply stores are chewable products by NYLABONE, which will not splinter or break. It is claimed that any nylon fibers, if swallowed, break down easily by stomach secretions. Rawhide chew toys are among the safer of the chew toys. Certainly they are preferable to an old shoe which may have nails and eyelets which can be swallowed. However, there have been reports of dogs strangling on bits of rawhide which become lodged in the throat. Dog biscuits are probably the safest thing for dogs to chew but they are bound to disappear with amazing speed. Too many biscuits could disrupt a carefully balanced diet. In short, you will have to settle on the

item about which you feel best, the least of the evils, when choosing your dog’s chew toy. GROOMING Before attempting the specialized grooming, which will enhance the characteristics of the variety of Dachshund(s) you own, there are basic grooming steps which need to be taken. Brushing and Combing: Before you attempt to bathe, scissor or trim your Dachshund it is essential that you completely brush or comb the coat. This stimulates the flow of the natural coat oils and removes any tangles, which may be in the coat of the Longhair or the Wirehair. It also removes any dead hairs prior to bathing. For the Longhairs and Wirehairs, pay particular attention to the heavily coated areas. Regular brushing encourages a healthy coat.

Teeth: You can keep your dog’s teeth clean by using a mixture of equal parts baking soda and salt. There are also tooth paste/cleaner for dogs available through pet supply vendors. Moisten a corner of a terry wash cloth (or use a tooth brush designed for canine application), dip into mixture and rub on each tooth. This will help keep plaque and tartar from building up and causing discoloration and/or premature loss of teeth.

tooth scaler

If tartar (hardened yellowish-brownish material) does become evident on your dog’s teeth, you can use a dental scaler to remove the tartar in much the same way as your dentist does. Scalers are available from most of the large animal supply places. To use the scaler, place it parallel to the
– 12 –

tooth on which you are working and at the edge of the gum line. For the upper teeth, draw the scaler down from the gum line to the tip of the tooth, using firm pressure. For the lower teeth, draw the scaler up from the gum line to the tip of the tooth. Once all the teeth have been scaled in this manner, use the baking soda and salt mixture to remove any tiny bit of matter that you may have missed. (Take care to not cut the gums with the scaler. If you feel unsure or, uncomfortable performing this task, most veterinary offices offer this service.) Ears: Dog’s ears need to be cleaned on a regular basis, Remember, they are sensitive, so you should not probe too deeply, or you may cause injury. A cotton tipped swab dipped in Baby Oil does a nice job on the ears. Make sure you use the swab gently. Anal glands: (*Note: In addition to these instructions, ask your veterinarian to show you the correct approach the first time, as you may cause extreme pain or injury if not done correctly) These glands are located in either side of the rectal opening and secrete fluid, which aids the dog in moving his bowels. Sometimes the anal fluid builds up and hardens to the point where impaction and/or abscess occur. This can be very painful for the animal, and will require veterinary attention. To help avoid this situation, you should periodically empty these glands. The frequency will depend on how quickly matter builds up. When the anal glands are full you can actually feel the semi-hard sacs on wither side of the rectum. The contents of the anal gland have a very vile odor, so it is best to empty them immediately before bathing the dog, or have soap and water solution available to sponge bathe the rectal area as you empty the glands. To empty the glands, stand the dog on a firm surface with his hindquarters toward you. Grasp the dog’s tail with one hand and hold it up. With the other hand place a piece of cotton, gauze pad, or several tissues over the rectal area and, with your thumb and forefinger, press slightly inward (towards the dog’s body) on either side of the rectal opening. Gradually squeeze your fingers together toward the rectal opening and outward, away from the dog’s body. Repeat this procedure until no more fluid is expressed. *

Nails: It is important to keep your dog’s nails short, both for his comfort, and to prevent his feet from splaying which allows debris and stones to catch between his pads. The Dachshund has a compact foot designed for crossing tough terrain while in pursuit of game. To help keep the foot this way, short nails are a necessity. From the standpoint of the house pet, short nails do not scratch your furniture, catch on clothing, rugs, bedding or upholstery. The easiest nail clipper to use is a RESCO NAIL CLIPPER. This is a guillotine-type blade instrument available at most pet supply places. Most people are afraid to cut the dog’s nails for fear of making the dog bleed. Powdered nail clotting material is also available from most pet supply dealers. (Have your breeder or veterinarian demonstrate the best length and technique if this is your first time.)

The dog’s nail has a very broad base and then a definite point where the nail suddenly begins to taper. It is at this point that the nail should be cut. If you do cut the nail too short and it begins to bleed, take a pinch of the powdered nail clotting material and press it on the end of the nail. This powder is an coagulant and will stop bleeding quickly. The freshly cut edges of the nails can be smoothed with a nail file. Some breeders will use small handheld grinders instead of tail trimmers. This enables them to grind the nail short and smooth. It may take a few sessions for the dog to become accustomed to the noise and vibration but leaves a nicely groomed appearance to the nails and feet. Bathing: Place a rubber mat in the bottom of the bathtub or sink to provide sure footing for the dog. Place a drop of mineral oil in each eye to protect against the possibility of irritation should you accidentally get shampoo in the eyes. A spray hose attachment facilitates wetting and rinsing the dog; a sponge or wash cloth will allow you to wash the head, ears and muzzle without getting shampoo in the eyes.
– 14 –

Select a good quality shampoo to use. Wet the dog’s coat with tepid water, apply the shampoo and work into a rich lather. The dog will enjoy a brisk massage with the shampoo and it is good for his coat and skin. Rinse and shampoo again. Be sure to rinse the dog thoroughly since any shampoo residue will cause dryness, flaking and itching. Towel dry the dog, or you may use a hair dryer set on the lowest setting to complete the drying process. Special Bathing Procedure: For dry/flaking skin; apply baby oil or bath oil (or breeder recommended product) and brush it into the coat thoroughly. Leave this on for a few hours, then bathe the dog as usual. Dry or brittle coat on the Longhair Dachshund; use the same procedure as outlined above, but follow the bath with a good quality crème rinse. Leave the crème rinse on the coat for 2 to 3 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. SHOW GROOMING OF THE LONGHAIR DACHSHUND Curly, wavy or fly-away coat of the hair on the back of the front legs should be combed toward the back of the body. If the coat is too profuse and tends to protrude to the sides, use thinning shears until the coat does comb back. It is also helpful to frequently dampen this hair and comb it back in order to train the hair growth. The hair on the back of the thighs should also be long and full, but not protruding outward to the side of the legs. Use the thinning shears to blend this coat into the upper thigh area. Feet: Cut the hair on the bottom of the feet even with the pads. With the foot placed securely on a firm surface, trim the foot with a straight scissor. The desired look is a rounded, compact foot. You may have to scissor the top of the foot in the area of the nails to remove wispy hairs which stick up over the nails. Do not cut the hair in an outline around the nails; rather, cut so as to blend this hair into a fully coated rounded appearance.

Tail: The coat of the Longhair Dachshund should reach its greatest length on the underside of the tail. Therefore, little is done to the tail other than combing and brushing to maintain its condition. PET GROOMING OF THE LONGHAIR DACHSHUND Combing the back of the neck and body with a MAGNET STRIPPING BLADE on a regular basis will remove dead hair and undercoat and keep the coat in good condition. Scissor the hair on the bottom of the feet even with the pads to keep dirt and debris from accumulating. Use a thinning shear to shorten the hair on the sides of the neck where the coat growth from the back of the neck joins the front of the neck. Regular, but not frequent, bathing followed by a crème rinse and lots of brushing will keep the coat in good, shining condition.

SHOW GROOMING OF THE SMOOTH DACHSHUND The Smooth (short haired) Dachshund has a short, thick, shiny coat. Very little grooming is required in order to show this variety. Head: Use a straight shear with rounded tips to cut the whiskers on the muzzle (optional), over the eyes, on the cheeks, and on the underside of the jaw. These whiskers should be cut very close to the skin.

– 16 –

Neck: If the dog has a particularly thick coat, you may have to scissor the stray hairs on both sides of the neck where the coat growth from the back of the neck joins the growth from the front. You may also have to trim the wispy hairs that may protrude at the point of the breastbone. This may be done with either straight edge scissors or thinning shears. Cut slowly and carefully so that you do not leave a bare spot or sharp line where you have scissored. Tail: If the hair on the underside of the tail is thick and unkempt looking trim with scissors or thinning shears to give a sleek tapered look. Feet: Trim any hair that may protrude on the underside of the feet so that the hair is even with the pads. A light spray of coat dressing oil, or a small amount of baby oil rubbed on your hands and then applied to the coat, will add luster and sheen to the coat. PET GROOMING OF THE SMOOTH DACHSHUND The Smooth Dachshund who is not being shown requires practically no grooming to be the ideal house pet. He should be bathed occasionally and brushed often to keep the skin healthy and the coat glowing.

SHOW GROOMING THE WIREHAIRED DACHSHUND According to the Breed Standard for Dachshunds, “With the exception of the jaw, eyebrows, and ears, the whole body is covered with a perfectly uniform, tight, short, thick, rough, hard coat, but with finer shorter hairs (undercoat) everywhere distributed between the coarser hairs”, resembling the coat of the German Wirehaired Pointer. There should be a beard on the chin. The eyebrows are bushy, on the ears the hair is shorter than on the body, but in any case conforming to the rest of the coat. The general arrangement of the hair should be such that
– 17 –

the Wirehaired Dachshund, when seen from a distance should resemble the smooth haired. In grooming the Wirehaired Dachshund, you are attempting to enhance the Dachshund shape of the body and emphasize the wire characteristics. There are basically two methods of grooming the Wirehaired Dachshund ~ plucking and stripping, or a combination of both. Plucking consists of using the thumb and index finger to pull out the longer coat hairs. Stripping is done with a “stripping” knife. There are many types of stripping knives available. You must find the one most comfortable for you to use. Stripping is done by placing the knife against the coat, catching a small amount of hair against the blade with your thumb and pulling the longer hairs out of the coat. With either method, small amounts of hair should be done at a time and the hair should be pulled in the direction of coat growth with quick jerking motion. Never pluck or strip the hair against the direction of coat growth. When you plan to remove a great deal of the coat, referred to as “taking the coat down”, you should do the major work eight to twelve weeks before the date of the show. The rate of coat growth differs from dog to dog, so you might have to experiment to determine the best time schedule for your dog. Once you get the coat in show condition, you can maintain it by stripping or plucking the longer hairs on a weekly basis. This removes any dead hair and allows for constant new growth of hair. This method is called “rotation of the coat”. Head: The head should be stripped or plucked from just behind the eyebrows, over the top of the skull and down into the neck area, between the eyes, and the cheek area from the outer corner of the eye to the corner of the lip. Stray hairs at the inner corner of the eye should be removed and the eyebrows should be longer at the inside corner of the eye tapering to the outside corner of the eye where they are flush with the skull structure. The eyebrows should be short enough to allow the eyes to be readily seen. Since the overall head structure should be uniformly tapered, it may be necessary to thin out the beard to achieve this look. It is also possible to
– 18 –

remove some of the coat from the center of the under jaw to allow the beard to lie closer against the muzzle. Since the overall head structure should be uniformly tapered, it may be necessary to thin out the beard to achieve this look. It is also possible to remove some of the coat from the center of the under jaw to allow the beard to lie closer against the muzzle. Ears: Remove all the longer hairs from the outside and underside of the ear. This will leave a very short undercoat on the ear. Usually this hair has to be removed only once or twice; it does not tend to grow back. The hair on the inside of the ear where the ear joins the cheek should be scissored very close to the skin to allow the ear to lie flat against the cheek. Neck: The longer hairs on the neck should be stripped or plucked under the chin and down the throat to the breast bone, along the sides of the neck; and on the back of the neck, blending into the shoulder area. Body: The body coat is kept a little longer that the head and neck ~ about ? to ? inches long. Stripping or plucking should be done from the neck area along the topline and sides to the tail. The underside of the body should be plucked or stripped to conform to the rest of the body. Do not leave great length of coat here is it will look like a skirt. If the dog does not have a deep chest, groom the coat on the underside of the body so that the chest area is slightly longer, and taper it up into the loin area. Tail: The tail should be plucked or stripped to give an even tapered look. Since the underside of the tail may be sensitive, you may wish to use thinning shears on this area. When using any type of scissor always cut with the growth of the hair, never against it. Be sure to cut the hairs around the anus for a neat appearance, which conform with the rest of the grooming. Legs: The hair on the legs should conform to the body coat, but may be just a little longer, Judicious plucking or stripping of the longer hairs should be done to enhance the full wire coat growth.
– 19 –

Feet: Use straight scissors to trim the hair on the bottom of the feet even with the pads. With the foot place securely on a flat surface, use a straight edge scissor to trim the hair around the foot. The desired effect is one of a rounded, compact foot. PET GROOMING OF THE WIREHAIR DACHSHUND You can achieve the same result in the appearance of the dog by using a clipper. However, in most instances, you will not be able to maintain the harsh texture of the coat with this method. Clippering is a time saving method of keeping the dog neat while general conforming to the desired look of the Wirehaired Dachshund. Follow the same pattern of grooming as outlined above using the following blades: HEAD, UNDERSIDE OF THE NECK and EARS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .#10 BACK OF THE NECK, BODY and TAIL . . . . .#5 (leaves hair 1/2” long) Or #7 (leaves hair 1/4” long) EYEBROWS and BEARD . .Scissor these to the desired shape and length

TO BREED OR NOT TO BREED YOUR DACHSHUND This decision demands a great deal of thought. Aside from the fact that having a litter will not make “Gretchen” a better dog and that accurate bookkeeping on the cost of a litter will reveal a deficit rather than enough profit to put the kids through college, the outstanding fact remains that the world does not need more dogs. Reports estimate that annually more than twenty million pets are euthanized for reasons that are not medical. Most of these were produced by the “casual breeder”, if you will, or the non-responsible pet owner. Will your litter contribute to the problem of the burgeoning numbers of unwanted pets? Will your litter be a credit to the breed? The world does not need more dogs and the
– 20 –

Dachshund fancy only needs better Dachshunds. The mating of purebred dogs should be aimed towards producing improved quality in both temperament and body structure. It should also be based on a thorough knowledge of the breed and the principles of sound breeding. If these factors are not present then the breeding should not be carried out. SO YOU WANT TO SHOW DOGS Because they are fewer in number, show quality Dachshund are likely to cost more. Breeders are sometimes even reluctant to part with show prospects in an outright sale and may offer co-ownerships or other breeder’s terms. A true show prospect could be vital to the breeding program the breeder has planned. Once you have acquired your Dachshund with show potential, you can be sure that the breeder will be helpful in getting you both into the ring. Match shows are a good place to start for both you and your dog. Your local kennel club probably sponsors at least one match a year, as well as one point show. In addition to kennel clubs for all purebred dogs, there are breed clubs specializing in single breeds. To find the kennel clubs and Dachshund Clubs near you, contact the American Kennel Club, 260 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10010, www.akc.org on the internet or through the DCA web site at www.dachshund-dca.org. Through these clubs, you will surely get all the help and information you need to begin the quest for the championship title for your Dachshund. ENJOYING A DOG SHOW If you are attending a dog show for the first time, you will be fascinated with the great number and variety of dogs that you will see. After a tour of the benches, or the show grounds, you will be drawn to the judging rings and wonder at the activity going on there. Here you will see a number of dogs being posed, paraded up and down by intense handlers, checked front and back individually, then against each other by a very serious person who is the judge. Equally serious are the people showing off their dogs, hoping to win his/her approval and the coveted ribbons he/she will award. Finally, the judge indicates which dogs have won and a burst of applause may greet his/her decision. You may wonder why the cute little dog appealed so much and you did not win anything….and you may wonder what it is all about. If you under– 21 –

stand what is going on, what a dog show is all about and why it is so important to the people who exhibit, you will certainly get more enjoyment out of the show. That is the purpose of this chapter, to help you understand and enjoy a dog show. The primary purpose of a dog show is to enable dog owners to exhibit their dogs in competition with others of its kind. The ultimate objective is to improve the quality of all purebred dogs. An intelligent breeding program, using the dogs, which have proven through such competition, to be the better representatives of their breeds, achieves this goal. A dog show is a huge elimination contest. There are many contests taking place in every dog show. These may be the winning of blue ribbons, the winning of championship points, the Best of Breed and Best of Group honors and awards. A sanctioned, or licensed, dog show is for purebred dogs only and they must be registered or eligible for registration in the American Kennel Club. To be accepted, the entry form must show the dog’s individual registration number (or the litter registration number until the final registration process is completed). While dog shows are sometimes referred to as “canine beauty contests” there is much more that just the surface beauty to be considered. In 2006, there are 153 breeds of dogs are recognized by the American Kennel Club. Each of these breeds has its own “standard of perfection”. The judge takes account of two main factors. He judges the dogs against the “standard” for that breed and he judges the dogs against each other. He tries to pick those dogs which are nearest to ideal “type”, and which are sound both physically and mentally. The rules require that the judge personally examine each dog. He must check their teeth, eyes, hair coat, and must determine that the males have both testicles normally descended into the scrotum. If a dog is limping in the ring, it is mandatory that the judge excuse it from further judging. Any dog that attempts to bite the judge will also be excused. There are “regular classes” for each breed. MALES ARE JUDGED SEPARATELY FROM FEMALES IN ALL REGULAR CLASSES. The
– 22 –

classes are as follow: Puppy, Novice, Bred-By-Exhibitor, American-Bred and Open. (In dachshunds, the Open classes are divided into Open Miniature and Open Standard.) Puppy classes are divided by age: six to nine months and nine to twelve months. The Novice class is for dogs six months of age or over which have not won three first prizes in Novice class, a first in Bred-By-Exhibitor, American-bred, or Open, nor one or more points towards their championship. The Bred-by-Exhibitor class is for dogs which are owned by the breeder and are shown by the breeder or a member of his/her immediate family (husband, wife, father, son, daughter, brother, sister). The American-bred class is for all dogs except champions whelped in the United States by reason of mating that took place in this country. The *Open class is for any dog, six months of age or older, that has not completed its championship. *Foreign bred dogs must enter this class, except that Canadian-bred puppies can enter the Puppy class. Some breeds have the Open class divided by color as well as miniature and standard, including Dachshunds. The winner of each class gets a blue ribbon and is then eligible to compete in the Winners classes. The judge picks the best male for Winners Dog and the best female for Winners Bitch. A dog (or bitch) which has been beaten only by the winner of the Winners class can then come in to compete for Reserve Winners against the remaining first prize winners. Best of Breed competition brings together already recognized AKC champions of sexes, plus the Winners Dog and Winners Bitch. The judge then makes his choice from this group for Best of Breed. If his selection is a male for Best of Breed, the judge then selects a bitch for Best of Opposite Sex. If the Winners Dog or Winners Bitch is not selected as Best of Breed, the judge then selects either the dog or the bitch as Best of Winners. This same procedure takes place in every breed entered in the show. Thus, if there were ten different Hound breeds entered, there would be ten Best of Breed winners. These ten would then be called back into the ring to be judged against each other, to decide which dog is the one best qualified to represent all of the Hounds. The one placed first, as in the other six breed groups, becomes eligible to enter the finals for that highest of dog show competition, Best In Show.

– 23 –

The seven outstanding specimens are now paraded before the judge who must decide on just one of them for the coveted Best Dog In Show! In this way a show that started with 3,000 dogs ends up with one grand champion at that event! To become a champion, a dog must win 15 champion points. Points are earned only by placing first in the Winners class (Winners Dog or Winners Bitch). However, the dog chosen Best of Winners is entitled to the higher of points won in the two sexes. Championship points are awarded on a scale drawn up by AKC. The country is divided into four groups, the points for each breed are figured on the basis of national registrations and previous show entries for that area. All show catalogs are required to carry the “scale of points” for all breeds in the section of the country where the show is held. This may vary for dogs and bitches in the same breed. Five points is the largest number that can be won at any show. There is one other way in which a dog can win championship points, If a dog comes through the classes, wins Best of Breed, then wins First in his Group, he is entitled to the maximum number of points awarded to any other dog in that group. A check system to prevent “cheap championships” is set by the provision that a dog must win two shows with three points (also referred to as a Major) or more under at least two different judges. Thus, a dog must be shown in stiff competition before it can win the coveted title of “Champion”. It is important to note, again, the versatility of the Dachshund. Do not forget that the Dachshund can compete in other areas such as Obedience, Rally, Agility, Tracking, Field trial and Earth dog events. Whether you choose to compete in conformation shows or not, these other areas are challenging and fun. The reward of seeing your dog using the keen hunting skills for which he/she was bred and/or demonstrate his/her ability as a trained companion is beyond words. (If you choose to have your dog neutered or spayed, you can still compete in these areas.) Working with your dog in any or all of these performance events will also result in a bond that is hard to break. Training tips and articles are available in DCA’s booklet, “Versatility Certificate”, an award program designed by DCA to recognize the achievements of the Dachshund.

If you wish to enter a dog show, check with one of the national dog magazines, AKC web site (www.akc.org), DCA web site (www.dachshund-dca.org) or DCA Newsletter for the list of upcoming Field shows. This list will give the dates of the shows, the superintendent, one or more of the club officers and their address. You then write for entry blanks and premium lists, which have all the pertinent information on judges and prizes offered at the shows. Lists are distributed six weeks ahead of the show date and entries closed three weeks prior to the show. Fix to six days before the show you will receive a receipt for your entry, which will serve as identification which you must present for you and your dog to enter the show. If the show is benched, stalls will be provided in which the dog(s) must be kept during show hours. Your identification will show your stall number and the deadline hour for getting your dog into the show. If the show in unbenched, the dog(s) may be kept with you anywhere on the showgrounds (there may be specific Club instructions). Your identification slip may tell you that you may leave as soon as you are not needed any longer. The AKC recognizes 153 breeds, which are divided into seven groups. They are classified, more or less, by the kind of work the dogs were intended to perform. In addition, there is a Miscellaneous Classification for breeds known to be purebred but which are so rare in the United

There is no need to buy something expensive, as a box with an old cushion or one lined with old blankets will do. It is a useful idea to place a clock under the puppy's sleeping blanket for the first few nights. The ticking sound will make the puppy feel less lonely and help to train the pet to stay in bed. t o hear, but within range for dogs.

Feed your pet at regular intervals and take it outside after each meal. If you live in the country, let the puppy run about outdoors as soon as it wakes up in the morning and before it goes to bed at night. If you live in an apartment, or if you are unable to take your puppy outdoors, teach it to use a box filled with torn newspapers. Put the puppy into the box after it has eaten and make your pet stay there until it has done what is expected of it. Change the newspapers every day, but always leave a few soiled papers.

If the puppy misbehaves in the house, punish it only if you catch it in the act; otherwise, the puppy might not know why it is being punished. Spank it with a folded newspaper, and say clearly, "No! No! No!" Then put the puppy out of the house or in its box. 16

Teaching your dog to walk on a leash does not have to be a tiresome job. In the same hand in which you hold the leash, hold a piece of dog biscuit. When your puppy smells the biscuit and sees that you have something good to eat, it will follow along without getting the leash tangled up about your legs. After a few minutes, give the dog the cooky. Soon the dog will learn how you want it to walk on the leash.

It is not too difficult to teach your dog to sit on command. Call the dog to you, slip the leash over its head, and say, "Sit!" Repeat the word, hold the dog's head up with the leash, and press down on its rump. Reward the dog by giving it a bit of food as soon as it is in a sitting position, and pat it to show that you think it is a good dog. Make the dog remain sitting until you say "Up." The more often you repeat these words, the less time it will take the dog to understand what it is you want it to do. 17

FOREWORD 
By Bill Langworth y 
I frst met Kyra and Cha1cy while I was producing an animal talent show for television.  One 
of the  bookers announced she  had found a dog  who could read! In all my years  of working 
with pet  tricks,  frst as David Letterman' s Stupid  Pet Tricks Coordinator then as a producer 
on Animal Planet' s Pet Star,  I' d heard of some clever animals,  but I had a feeling this one 
was special.  Sure enough,  Kyra and Chalcy promptly won  the  show, then  came back and 
won in the  championships! 
Two things about Kyra and Chalcy stand out in my memory: frst, their big smiles;  and 
second, they did everything together. The camera can make  people focus on themselves, 
forgetting they're only half of a team,  but from the frst rehearsal to the fnal championship 
round. Kyra and Cha1cy did everything together.  When Kyra phoned me  and  said,  �Chalcy 
and I are writing a book,"  I wasn' t surprised-my only question was, "Who typed?" 
JÚJ Dog  Tricks is all about doing things as a team. Kyra and Chalcy use only positive 
training and motivational techniques  to reinforce trick training as a fun way to  play rather 
than a chore. The  tricks are  all designed to  develop  a particular aspect of your dog's 
abilities,  from the mental to the physical, while also developing trust and friendship 
between you and your companion. 
Kyra and Chalcy know every trick in the book;  that  is, they have practiced and performed 
all 101 routines,  so  1U1 Dog  TIcks is flled with frsthand advice.  Kyra and Chalcy are 
equally adept in both mental and physical tricks,  so you'll find instruction on everything 
from teaching your  dog to count to teaching your dog to play basketball. The instructions 
are clearly illustrated and easy to follow, but no  detail  has been spared. This is the one and 
only book every trick trainer needs,  whether you plan to entertain yourself, your friends, or 
huge  crowds  and national television audiences like Kyra  and  Chalcy. 
Kyra Sundance and Chalcy are uniquely qualified to write the defnitive trick training book. 
It's every  trick trainer's privilege that Kyra and Chalcy took time from their performing 
schedule to share their secrets.  So enjoy this  book,  then get outside  and play.  As Kyra and 
Chalcy always say:  "Do More  With Your Dog!®" 
1ULangworthy  spent  many years  as  a pet trick  coordinator for Late Show  with David 
Lettan  and  a  wIlter and  coproducer  of Animal Planet's  "Pet Star"  talent  competition. 
He's  auditioned  thousands  of  animal  acts  across  the  countly. 
AUTHORS'  NOTE 
�See?"  I said,  �Chalcy keeps missing the weave pole entrance." 
� you should have  taught her initially using the two-pole method"  advised the  nationally 
ranked agility coach.  " Dogs who start with the  two-pole method  never miss an entrance. " 
"Well, we didn't." I admitted,  "We trained a different method.  So this is where we're at 
now.  How do we fix it ?"  I asked.  She  shook her head. 
" Dh, it's too late now, " said the coach as she walked off. 
This coach was  of the  opinion  that  since I' d screwed up my dog by  using the wrong training 
method,  I should cut my losses and make a fresh start with a new agility dog.  In other 
words,  don't waste your time fixing something when you can buy a newer,  shinier one for 
cheaper! 
Needless to say. I didn't give up on Chalcy.  I can't begin to list all the training mistakes 
I've made with her over the years.  I've taught her wrong things,  using wrong methods, 
while giving wrong feedback.  Sure,  I'd messed up in our training, but we fxed it!  We went 
back  and retaught skills and  relearned  rules.  It' s a little harder this way, granted, but 
certainly possible.  I don't expect my dog to be a machine, and I' m not one either. We try, 
we learn, we fail, we succeed. We work together and afford each other endless second 
chances. We still miss the occasional weave pole entrance,  but we never miss the 
opportunity to give  it  one  more go! 
Whether your dog is young or old, athletic or lazy, qUick-witted or dumb as a rock, he's 
YOllrdog and his success need only be measured in ¸OuIeyes. 
I hope this book inspires you to not only teach tricks,  but to  "Do More With Your Dog!®" 
-Kyra Sundance and Cha1cy 
INTRODUCTION 
Rover knows when you are preparing for a trip. Fido hears the  word  "bath" or "vet"  and 
takes  cover under the bed.  Spot  senses when you've had a bad day  and lays his head in your 
lap, and Buster nudges your arm as you sit on the couch trying to find the motivation to go 
for a walk. These examples of human/dog communication illustrate the familial relationship 
dogs play in our lives.  And this relationship,  as with any positive relationship in our lives, 
requires nurturing to keep it alive and flourishing. 
Trick training is a way to build upon this relationship, establishing communication 
methods, trust, and mutual  respect.  It offers a way to bond with your dog as you strve 
toward common  goals  and  delight in your successes.  It deepens paths of communication, 
built through repetition and effort. 
If you've ever tried to  communicate a message to a person who speaks a foreign language, 
you've probably tred a combination of pantomime,  pictographs,  sound mimicry, and other 
tactics quite hilarious to onlookers.  But when that message finally gets communicated . . .  
� Ahhh!  The goat cheese pizza! "   . . .  there is a feeling of mutual success and bonding.  That 
same joy and bond can be  achieved  by you and your dog as you work together on dog 
trcks! 
Trick training does more  than teach cute party tricks to entertain your friends. Trick training 
offers an  opportunity  to better understand  how your  dog thinks and have him better 
understand your cues.  The trust and cooperative spirit developed  through this process will 
last a lifetime. 
HOW TO  USE THIS BOOK 
Start anywhere!  Each trick displays a dif fculty rating and prerequisite skills. You can work 
on several new tricks within the same  training session,  and you may wish to keep a list  of 
all your  dog's tricks to train each session.  Reinforcement  is a constant process and just 
because your dog has mastered a trck doesn't mean you should stop practicing! 
CAN ANY DOG LEARN TruCKS? 
Sure!  You'll find  that the more tricks your dog knows, the  qUicker he'll pick up new ones. 
In a sense, you've taught him how to learn. 
CUE, ACTION, REWARD 
Teaching a trick comprises three parts,  the first  being a verbal or physical cue to your dog, 
signaling the desired behavior. The second part is the action performed by your dog, and the 
third is the reward.  Do not attempt to bribe your dog by  offering the reward before he has 
done the action,  and do not expect your dog to perform an action before you have given the 
cue. 
YOUR JOB AS A TRAINER 
Your job as a trainer is to gUide your dog in a consistent and motivating environment. 
Gudance 
Guide your dog through the process of executing a new behavior, rewarding baby steps 
along the way. The goal of each training session  is  to  get  better results than the last time. 
Consistency 
Know the behavior you are looking for, and don't be wishy-washy.  Use the same voice and 
intonation each time you give a verbal cue and enunciate clearly. 
Motivat ion 
Think about an athletic coach. Is his job merely to plan the training schedule and tape it to 
the locker room door? No!  He inspires, motivates, and encourages!  He is upbeat when you 
are  discouraged and slaps your shoulder with a  "good job!" when you need  it.  You serve the 
same  purpose for your dog.  Every bit  of enthusiasm you  inject  into your  dog  training will 
speed up his learning. And when your dog does something right use your high-pitched 
"happy voice"  (yes, men, you have one too) to exude your delight! 
TIMING 
Imagine you are searching for something and are being gUided by feedback of  "hot"  or 
"cold." But now imagine this feedback is being delayed before you hear it. You may 
actually be receiving "cold" feedback as you approach the  object or  vise  versa.  Not  only  is 
the  object not  being  found, but  you are getting frustrated at  the  inconsistency of the 
feedback.  Imagine how much easier this  task would be if the  feedback were  given with 
correct timing. 
In trick training.  it is imperative that you mark  (with a word,  treat, or clicker)  the exact 
moment that your dog performed correctly.  Don't reward  10  seconds later, as you may be 
rewarding a completely different behavior. 
A common timing mistake is in rewarding too late. For example,  you tell your dog to sit, 
and he does. You fish for a treat in your pocket, and he stands up to receive it. What did you 
just reward? You rewarded him for standing up! The treat should have been  given while the 
dog was in the proper position-sitting. Always reward your dog while he  is in the  desired 
position. 
MOTIVATORS/REWARDS 
�Shouldn't my  dog want to learn tricks merely to please me?"  Dogs do, in general, want to 
please their owners-but learning is hard!  Would you expect your child to do his 
homework every night merely to please you? Maybe, but a reward sure makes work more 
enticing  . . .  whether it be  a half hour of TV,  or a nice liver treat! 
A motivator,  or reward,  can come in different forms-a food morsel .   favorite toy, clicker 
signal, or praise.  In this book,  the steps rely mostly on food  treats.  Food is enjoyed by all 
dogs,  is qUick to dispense and be swallowed, and is a clear way to signal a correct response. 
Keep your dog extra motivated when learning a new trick by using "people food" treats 
such as hot dogs, cheese,  pizza crusts,  noodles, meatballs,  or whatever gets his mouth 
watering!  During the beginning stages of learning,  a toy can be a distraction,  as it takes a 
while for you to take it back and get your dog to regain focus. Praise is great, but can be 
arbitrary and unclear  . . .  �Good!  No, wait, you moved,  sort of. . . .  " Use a small but tasty 
food treat to reward the desired behavior. 
New dog trainers are always stingy with rewards. They attempt  to reward  with praise  or 
regular dog kibble.  Trick  training,  however,  is  dependent  upon the  dog's motivation  and 
you want to make this activity the  most fun thing he  does all day!  Go  ahead,  give  'em the 
good stuff! 
For those experienced in the  technique of clicker training,  a clicker  signal may be used to 
mark the correct behavior, followed by the treat. 
Do I have to carry around treats for the rest of my l? 
Before worrying about emptying our pockets of treats, we need to make  the behavior an 
automatic response.  No  matter how it is achieved, if you  tell your dog to  "sit"  500  times, 
and he  sits, it becomes an automatic  response.  For the first 500  times, he  was sitting 
because you were tempting him with  a treat.  Later, however,  his muscle memory just  hears 
the word  "sit"  and does it!  It is at this point that you can start weaning your dog off his 
expectation of a reward.  Rather than weaning completely off treats, however, use them as 
sporadic rewards. 
Upping the Ante 
The purpose of a treat is to reward a good effort.  In kindergarten,  a child gets a gold star for 
printing her name.  In first grade,  she  only gets a gold star if  she  prints it  neatly,  and  in 
second grade cursive is required for that same reward. What may  ha ve earned your dog a 
treat in the past, may no longer be enough to earn that  treat today. We call this  "upping the 
ante. " 
When first learing to shake a paw, reward your dog for barely lifting his paw, or for 
batting your  hand.  Once  he  has  the  hang  of this, withhold  the  treat until he  lifts  his  paw 
higher, or holds it longer.  Every time your dog is achieving a step with about 75 percent 
success,  up the ante and demand a higher skill to earn the treat. 
Jackpot 
We  all know the lure  of a jackpot.  Having achieved it once,  we will sit at the  slot machine 
all night in hopes of being rewarded with  that elusive  prize.  The jackpot theory, when 
applied to dog training,  can be a more  effective motivator than consistent rewards.  Here' s 
how to use it: ask your dog to  perform some  behaviors he is working on. If he does them 
fairly  well, give him no reward or a small reward. When he performs a behavior very well 
or better than he has in the  past, jackpot!  Give him a whole handful of treats! Wow, will 
that make an impression on him!  He will continue trying extra hard in hopes of hitting that 
jackpot again. 
Along the same  lines,  using several different types of treats during o training session can 
keep your dog motivated-"maybe I'll get the hot dog this time!" 
HELP YOUR DOG BE SUCCESSFUL 
The key to keeping your dog motivated is to keep him challenged,  achieving regular 
successes.  Try not to let your dog be wrong more than two or three times in a row,  or he 
could become discouraged and not wish to  perform.  Instead, go back to an easier step for a 
while. 
PUT IN THE TIME 
When teaching a new trick, it often appears that your dog is not getting the concept and has 
no idea what the desired behavior is.  He'll be squirming and pawing and obsessing over the 
treat in your  hand.  You might feel as ifhe will  never  understand.  Don't stress it.  Go  through 
the  same motions day afer day.  and  one  day you'll see a lightbulb go off in his head.  That's 
the  moment that  truly bonds you with your dog. 
NY  PEOPLE FAIL 
Picture this failure scenaro: you tell your dog to spin, while luring him in a circle with your 
treat,just as this book instructs. Your dog squirms and nips at your hand. You raise your 
voice and say  in a more firm tone,  �spin!" Your dog scratches  himself,  ignoring you.  You 
grab his collar, yelling this time  "spin!" while you drag him in a circle.  He  cowers  down, 
while you grumble about your dumb dog. 
The single most common reason people fail teaching dog tricks is their lack of patience. 
Even trainers with bad timing, poor coordination, and lack of common sense can manage to 
teach trcks better than an impatient trainer. 
Picture this success scenario: you  tell your dog to  spin,  while  luring him in a circle with 
your treat,just as this book instructs. Your dog squirms and nips at your hand.  You try 
again,  luring your  dog in a circle, as before. Your dog scratches himself,  ignoring you. You 
try again,  and your dog performs a lopsided sort of spin.  "Yeah!  That was great!" You try 
again,  and again,  and again, and a few  hundred more times  . . .  and one  day  . . .  you  have  it! 
How lucky are you to have the world's smartest dog? 
Progress can be slow and frustrating-keeping an even temper and consistent training 
method requires patience. 
END  ON A HIGH NOTE! 
Practicing new tricks is mentally tiring for your dog.  Keep it fun and end the session while 
your dog is  still wanting more.  End on a successful note,  even if you have to go  back to an 
easier behavior to achieve this. 
LURING VERSUS MANIPULATING 
There are two obvious ways  to get a dog into a desired position:  you can lure him by 
gUiding him  with  a treat  or toy.  or you  can  assert physical pressure to manipulate him  into 
position.  It is tempting to manipulate your dog's body physically because it is faster and 
more precise, however it can actually delay the learning process.  By manipulating your dog, 
you are encouraging him to relinquish initiative and be led.  He is not required to engage his 
brain and is not learning  the  motor skills required to position his body by himself. When 
possible,  it is always preferable to lure your dog to position his body himself. 
USE  "WHOOPS"  INSTEAD  OF  "NO" 
Trick training is the yin to obedience training' s yang. Trick training allows the  dog to be 
silly and encourages independent action.  You want to keep the enthusiasm high during 
training sessions or your dog  could shut down for fear of being wrong.  Save the word  "no" 
for when your dog is being naughty.  If your dog is giving you an incorrect behavior, it is 
probably not intentional.  Instead of "no,"  try a more  lighthearted  "whoops! "  
FIRST  PÍISE, THEN TOUCH, AND TREAT  LAST 
As discussed earlier, correct timing of your reward is essential. When teaching new tricks, 
food is often used as a lure and is released instantly to mark a correct behavior.  For more 
general obedience  training,  or when rewarding your dog at the end of a session, reward in 
this order:  praise, pat on the head,  and then a food  reward.  Not only will this serve  to keep 
your dog in a calm state of mind, but an association will develop whereby verbal praise will 
be pleasantly associated with your touch,  and your touch will be associated with the food 
reward. 
RELEASE WORD,  "OK!" 
Your dog needs to understand at which times he is under your control and at which times he 
has been released. When instructed to  "down"  or "stay"  for example, your  dog  is expected 
to remain in that position until you release him with your release word.  "OK" is the most 
commonly used release word.  When  a training session has ended,  "OK" releases your dog 
to  run  and  play.  "OK" also  releases your  dog tojump out of the  parked  car,  to pounce on a 
toy. and to play with another dog. 
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF HAND SIGNALS? 
Dogs can perform a trick based upon a verbal cue or hand signal.  Hand signals are 
extremely useful for dogs performing in movies on quiet sets,  and they  generally give you 
more  options.  When a child asks your dog  a question, your subtle  "bark" hand signal can 
cue your  dog to answer!  Most  dogs  actually  respond  to hand signals more  readily  than 
verbal cues. Try it with your dog:  use  a verbal cue from one  trick while signaling for 
another trick.  Most ofen,  the  dog will perform the  trick  indicated by your  hands! 
CAN I MAKE UP MY OWN WORDS AND SIGNALS  FOR 
TRICKS? 
Words and signals for some tricks are more standardized than others. Basic obedience 
commands and many agility commands are widely used and have evolved with good 
reason.  It can be helpful to use standardized verbal cues and hand signals, especially if your 
dog has aspirations of a movie career. Hand signals may look arbitrary but have often 
evolved  from  the  methods used in a dog's initial training.  The  raising of the  hand as a signal 
to  "sit" evolves from your initial upward baiting when teaching the command.  A downward 
hand  motion is used to signal  "down"  and parallels your initial  baiting of your dog near the 
floor.  The toe-touch foot  signal for  "take a bow"  draws your  dog's attention toward the 
floor,  coaxing his head downward.  And the  flick of your wrist  to the right is a diminished 
version of the large circle you drew when teaching your dog to  "spin . " 
Trick training, of course, is not a life-or-death pursuit and if you want to make up your own 
words and signals,  nobody can stop you! A word of caution though: the  more  tricks you 
teach, the  qUicker you will run out of words.  "Left"  and  "right"  are tempting to use  in the 
beginning, but a time may come when wish you had saved those words for a different trick. 
CAN I MAKE UP MY OWN TRICKS? 
Some of the best tricks happen by accident!  If your dog acts out a long and laborious death 
in the  "play dead"  trick, capitalize on his inventiveness and teach the trick his way.  In 
obedience class,  your job is to instruct your dog on the correct behaviors, and his job is to 
do exactly what you wish.  In trick training you are a team-allow the training process to be 
a collaborative one. 
CHAINING COMMANDS 
This is the really fun part!  Once your dog has learned individual behaviors, you can chain 
them together and give a name to this new set of actions.  �Night-night," for example, chains 
the behaviors of come, dow, take it ,   roll over, and head dow to produce an impressive 
trick of your dog rolling himself up in a blanket! There are many ways to use command 
chains,  and even in practice they are a great brain exercise for your dog.  Even a simple 
command of �target,  sit"  engages your dog's brain to execute frst one action and then 
another. 
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO TRAIN A DOG? 
How many years does it take for a child to become educated? For an athlete to become 
skilled? How many piano lessons until you're a musician? Dog training should be thought 
of as a lifelong process. Although at some point your dog will be able to produce a behavior 
on cue,  he will  still need repetition and refinement to maintain and improve  his skills. 
Challenge your dog with new skills for the rest of his life,  and you'll find your bond will 
increase tenfold. 
REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS 
As you read the table of contents in this book, you may be having wonderful fantasies of 
lounging on the couch while your dog obediently gets you a beer from the  fridge.  Or 
perhaps you envision commanding your dog to help with the housework by gathering up all 
his  toys into his toy box. Let me burst your bubble right now, your dog is never going do 
such complicated tricks completely independent of you, and certainly not without a reward. 
Tricks like these will require you to be within eye  contact of your dog  and will  probably 
require verbal coaching and multiple  commands.  Remember, while these tricks mimic 
everyday simple human  chores, they are complicated  challenges for your dog.

Chapter  1  Groundwork 
"Obedience"  is a word  often misinterpreted in dog training to suggest the imposition 
of a dominating control over our dog.  But let's get past the word and think of basic 
obedience skills as the groundwork upon which a successful living arangement 
between dog and owner is achieved. The sit, dow, come, and stay behaviors are 
marks of a civilized  and  well-behaved  dog.  These behaviors will also be required for 
almost every  trick in this book, and time spent teaching them now  will reduce 
frustration down the road. 
"Since  my dog already knows his groundwork commands, why  should we continue to 
practice themT 
Consider this:  the concert pianist warms up by playing scales,  the olympic gymnast 
rolls  summersaults, the teacher reviews lesson plans, and the NBA athlete works  on his 
free throws. 
Obedience  training serves a greater purpose than merely teaching your dog to perform 
behaviors upon command.  It is a mental exercise and a comfortable  routine  that  allows 
you to reconnect with your dog.  Warming up with these familiar skills gives your dog 
the confidence to achieve new  ones.

Your dog sits squarely on his hindquarters and remains there until released. 
1 Stand or kneel in front of your dog,  holding a treat in your hand a little higher than your 
dog's head, 
2 Slowly move the treat straight back over your dog's head. This should cause his nose to 
point up and his rear to drop.  If his rear does not drop,  keep moving the treat straight 
backward toward his tail.  The  instant  his rear touches the  foor,  release  the  treat  and  mark 
the  behavior by saying  "good sit!" 
óIf your dog is not responding to the  food  lure,  use your index finger and thumb to put 
pressure on either side of his  haunches, just  forward  of his hip bones.  Pull up on his leash 
at the same  time to rock him back into a sit.  Praise and reward him while he is sitting. 
4 Once your dog is consistently sitting, wait a few seconds before  rewarding.  Remember to 
only reward while your dog is in the correct position-sitting. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Puppies as young as six weeks can start learning this command, 
and it is ofen the first  trick a dog learns.  Within a week,  you should see some progress!

Your dog drops to rest on either his chest and belly or askew on his hip. This vital 
command could help avert dangerous  situations such as unsafe road crossings. 
1 With your dog sitting facing you, hold a treat to his nose and lower it slowly to the floor. 
2 If you're lucky, your dog will  follow the treat with  his nose and lie down, at which time 
you can release  the treat and praise him.  Remember to only release the treat while your 
dog is in the correct position-lying down.  If your dog slouches instead of lying down, 
slide  the treat slowly toward him on the floor  between his front paws or away from him. 
It may take a little  time but your dog should eventually lie down. 
ó If your dog is not responding to the food  lure,  put slight pressure on his shoulder blade, 
pushing down and to the side.  Praise your dog when he drops to the floor.  It is always 
preferable  to coax the dog to position himself without your physical manipulation. 
4 Once your dog is  consistently lying down,  gradually delay the release of the treat.  With 
your dog lying down, say "wait, wait"  and then  "good" and release the treat.  Varying the 
time  before  treating will keep your dog focused. The  dog  should not move from the  down 
position until you have  given your release  word,  "OK!" 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Herding breeds and sedentary or massive dogs ofen drop easier 
into a d own position than long-legged,  deep-chested,  and hyper dogs. This skill can be 
learned by dogs and puppies of any age.

When in a stay, your dog holds his current position until released. 
1 Start with your dog sitting or lying down, as he is less likely to move from  these 
positions.  Use  a leash to guarantee control.  Stand directly in front  of him and in a serious 
tone,  say �stay," holding your palm fat,  almost touching his nose. 
2 Move a short distance away,  keeping eye contact with your dog,  and return to him.  Praise 
him with  �good stay" and give him a treat.  Be sure to give the praise and treat while your 
dog remains in the  seated  and staying position. 
ó If your dog moves from his sta y before you have released him, gently but firmly put him 
back in the spot where he was originally told to stay. 
4 Gradually increase the  time you ask your dog to  stay, as well as the distance between 
yourselves. You want your dog to be successful so if he is breaking his stays, go  back to 
a time and distance he is able to achieve. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  The tone of your voice and your body language will be a big part of 
getting your message across.  Be firm and consistent, and it won't take may sessions before 
your dog  begins to understand.

Upon your command, your dog comes immediately to you.  In competition, this command 
ends with your dog  sitting in front of you.  In order for this command to be consistently 
obeyed, your status as pack leader needs to be defnite.  Always reward your dog for 
obeying your  �come"  command, whether it be  with  praise or a treat.  Not  obeying this 
command,  however, should be viewed  as a major infraction and should end with you 
physically bringing your dog to the  spot  from where you originally called him. 
1 With your dog on a L ( 1. 8 m)  lead, command him to  �come"  and reel him qUickly in to

Chapter  2  Traditional Favorites 
ÍCtCÌ,shake, speak, and play dead + æ .  these useful, useless, and always charming 
tricks have been around since cavemen frst shared their bones with wolves.  Regardless 
of a lack of titles afer his name, a dog who falls to the ground on the command of 
�bang"  or offers a polite  paw to his guests will be top dog among your fends!  These 
tricks are expected of dogs and it is your task,  possibly even your duty. to teach them to 
your  clever canine. 
The tricks in this chapter have  withstood the test of time for a reason:  they are  simple to 
teach and easy  to learn. They  capitalize on dogs'  natural behaviors by  associating 
familiar actions with verbal cues.  Is your dog vocal? It should be simple for you to 
elicit a bark, associate it with a cue, and reward it.  Retrievers will no doubt fetch before 
they are out of puppyhood, and hyper dogs will be excited to proffer a paw when 
encouraged to  "shake. "  Let' s get started teaching these traditional favorites!

HAND  SICMAL 
When shakng hands, your polite pooch raises his paw to chest height.  allowing guests to 
shake his paw.  This  skill  is  taught for both paws. 
1 With your dog sitting before you,  hide a treat in your right hand, low to the ground. 
Encourage your dog to paw at it by saying  "get it"  and  "shake." Reward your dog with 
the treat the moment his left  paw comes off the ground. 
2 Gradually raise the height of your hand.  upping the ante,  until he is lifting his paw to 
chest height. 
óTransition to using the hand signal.  Stand up and hold the treat in your left hand, behind 
your back,  and extend your right hand while cuing "shake. "  When your dog paws your 
extended hand,  supJrt his paw in the air while you reward him with the treat from 
behind your  back. 
4 Repeat these steps on the opposite side to  teach  �paw." 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Any dog can learn this trick,  and it's always an endearing gesture. 
Practice a couple of times per day.  and always leave off on a high noie.  Chain these 
behaviors together to alternate  �shake"  and  �paw"  in qUick succession. 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
INSTEAD  OF PAWING AT MY HAND, MY DOG NOSES IT 
Bop  his  nose  a little to discourage this.  He may try barking.  nuzzling,  or doing 
nothing. Be patient, and keep  encouraging him.  If he is not liftng his paw on his 
own, tap or barely lift it for him and then reward. 
BUILD  ON IT!  Once you've mastered shake hands and paw,  use a similar action to 
learn chorus line kicks  (page  176) and wave goodbye  (page 202). 
TIP! Use the word  "good" to mark the exact instant your dog performed  the desired 
behavior. 
STEPS: 
1 Hide a treat in your right hand. low to the ground. 
2 As your dog improves,  raise your hand. 
ó Stand up and cue your dog.

Fetch  ake It 
TEACH IT: 
VERBAL  CUE 
Fetch  (retrieval) 
Take  it 
(object within reach) 
In fetch, your  dog  is directed to retrieve a specifed object. Tae it is when he takes an 
object within  reach into his mouth. 
FETCH: 
1 Use a box cutter to make a  1 "  (2.5 em)  slit in a tennis ball. Show your dog as you drop a 
treat inside the ball. 
2 Toss the  ball  playfully  and encourage the  dog to bring it back to you  by  patting your legs, 
acting excited, or running from  him. 
óTake the ball from your dog and squeeze it to release the treat for him. As he is unable to 
get the treat himself, he will learn to bring it to you for his reward. 
TAKE  IT: 
1 Select a toy that your dog enjoys and playfully hand it to him while giving the verbal cue. 
2 Have him hold it only a few seconds before  removing it from his mouth and trading him a 
treat for it. As your dog improves, extend the time he holds the  object  before  treating. 
Only treat if you remove the toy from your dog's mouth, not if he  drops it on his own. 
ó Be creative!  Have your dog hold a flag as he circles the field or have him carry a 
charming "feed me" sign.  A dog holding a pipe is always good for a laugh, and a posh 
pooch carrying a basket of cocktail napkins is sure to  impress! 
WHAT TO EXPECT: Many dogs are natural retrievers and will understand this trick 
within a few days. 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
MY  DOG HAS NO INTEREST IN CHASING THE BALL 
Motivate your dog by  acting excited  and  chasing the ball yourself.  Bat it around  or 
bounce it off walls.  Make it a competition and race him for it. 
MY DOG GETS THE BALL AND RUNS OFF WITH IT 
Never chase your dog when he  is  playing keep-away.  Lure  him back with a treat, 
or run away from him to encourage him to chase you. Have a second ball to get his 
attention. 
BUILD  ON IT!  Once you've mastered fetch,  build on it with: fetch H§slippers  (page 
36). newspaper delivery (page  40). and directed retrieve  (page  184). Build on take it

Drop it 
(release to ground) 
Give 
(release to hand) 
On the drop it cue, your dog releases the object from his  mouth,  dropping it  onto the 
ground.  Give is released to your hand. 
DROP IT: 
1 Is your dog food or toy motivated? Point to the ground and command your dog to  �drop 
it."  Do not move from your location, and keep repeating the command.  It may take 
several minutes, but when your dog fnally drops the toy,  reward him with food or by 
throwing his toy. 
GIVE: 
1 While your dog has o toy in his mouth, tell him to  �give" and offer him a treat in 
exchange for the toy. He will have to release the toy to  eat the treai,  at which time you 
can praise him. 
2 Give your dog his toy back,  so he understands that relinquishing  it to you does not mean 
that it will be taken away. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Dogs vary on their willingness to relinquish Û toy.  Build a habit of 
only throwing the toy if your  dog relinquishes it willingly. 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
MY  DOG WILL NOT RELEASE THE TOY 
Try using a less desirable toy and rewarding him with a highly desired toy when 
he obeys. 
SHOULD I FORCE AN  OBJECT AWAY FROM HIM? 
No,  as  this could result in a dog bite, intentional or not.  A better way to get a dog 
to  release  his grip is to pull  upward on the skin on the side of his rib cage.

Balance and Catch 
TEACH IT: 
VERBAL  CUE 
Wait,  Catch 
Your dog balances a treat or toy placed on his nose and,  at your signal,  tosses it and makes 
the  catch. 
1 Position your dog in a sit  (page  15) facing you.  Gently hold your dog's muzzle parallel to 
the foor and place a treat upon the bridge of his nose.  In a low voice,  coach him to 
�waaaait. " 
2 Hold this position for just a few  seconds before releasing his muzzle and telling him to 
�catch! "  Exuberant dogs will probably send the treat fying,  and will have to chase it 
down.  You'll want to slow these dogs down by  using a calm,  quiet  "catch."  Practice will 
hone their abilities until they can do it every  time. 
ó If your dog is allowing the treat to fall  to the floor, pretend to race him to pick it up. He 
wil1 1earn that he needs to catch the treat or risk losing it to you on the floor. 
4As your dog improves,  require him to balance the treat on his nose without the help of 
your hand on his muzzle. Placing the treat near the end of your dog's nose is usually 
easiest to catch,  but every dog is different. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Some  dogs will have naturally better coordination,  but all dogs will 
benefit from the motor functions practiced in this skil1. 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
HIS NOSE IS TOO SHORT! 
Although it is possible to teach this trick to pug-nosed breeds, it is more difcult. 
A bendable treat, such as a wet noodle, is easier to balance.

CATCH IT 
Here's another case  where  you  can  race  him  for the  treat  to increase  his  motivation 
to catch it qUickly. 
BUILD  ON  IT! Increase the difculty of this trick by having your dog beg  (page  28) 
while  balancing the treat. 
1 Hold his muzzle parallel and place a treat upon it. 
4 Remove your hand while he balances the treat. 
Practice will perfect his catch!

Sit PrettylBeg 
VRWL ÂÑ
P
TEACH IT: 
When �please"  doesn't work . . .  it may be time to beg! From a sitting position, your dog 
raises his forequarters while keeping his rear on the floor.  Your dog should sit on both 
hindquarters. with a straight spine,  paws tucked into his chest. The alignment of his 
hindquarters,  thorax, forequarters,  and head is key to his balance. 
SMALL DOGS: 
1 Position your dog in a sit  (page  15),  facing you. Use a treat to lure his  head up and back, 
while  cueing him to "beg." Allow him to nibble the treat from your fist, to entice him to 
stay in this position. If his hind-quarters lif off the foor, lower your treat a little, tell him 
to sit,  and tap his  bottom down. 
2 As your dog's balance  improves,  move away and use the verbal cue and hand signal. 
After several seconds, toss the treat to your dog. Remember to reward your dog while he 
is in the correct position,  not after he has lowered his front  paws. 
BIG DOGS: 
1 Position your dog in a sit.  Stand directly behind him, with your heels together and toes 
painted apart. 
2 Use a treat to gUide his head back and straight  up,  until he is  upright.  Steady his chest 
with your other hand.  He will need to fnd his balance;  as  he  improves,  use a lighter 
touch on his back and chest. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Some dogs may  learn this behavior easily, while others have a 
much harder time establishing their balance. This trick builds thigh and lower back strength, 
which will benefit any dog.  Your dog will  sit up and beg for your praise! 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
MY  DOG JUMPS AT THE TREAT 
Move slower when positioning your hand.  Do not reward your  dog if he jumps. 
MY DOG STANDS UP ON HIS HIND LEGS 
Keep your hand lower, and gently say  �sit."  Hold the treat at face  level. 
MY DOG CAN'T SEEM TO BALANCE 
This trick is easier for small dogs and round dogs.  Large, long, and deep-chested 
dogs can learn to  beg,  but they need more time to find their balance. 
BUILD  ON IT!  Now that your dog is  comfortable  balancing,  try teaching him to stand 
or walk on his hind legs! 
TIP!  Set small dogs on a table for easy access while training. 
"My favorite things to roll in: wet gss, horse manure, kty's halrballs." 
STEPS: 
SMLL DOGS: 
1 From a sit, lure his head up. 
Allow him to nibble the treat.

HAND  SIGNAL 
Your dog barks on cue. If your dog is barking up the wrong tree  . . .  then this is the trick for 
him! 
1 Observe what causes your dog to bark-a doorbell or knock, the postman, the sight of 
you with his leash-and use that stimulus to teach this trick.  Because most dogs bark at 
the sound of a doorbell, we'll use that as  an example. Stand at your front  door, with the 
door open so your dog will  be able to hear the bell.  Give the cue  "bark"  and press the 
doorbell. When your dog barks,  immediately reward him and reinforce the cue with 
"good bark."  Repeat this about six times. 
2 Continuing in the same session, give the cue but don't ring the bell. You may have to cue 
several times to get a bark.  If your dog is not barking,  return to the previous step. 
óTry this trick in a different room. Strangely enough, this can be a diffcult transition for 
your dog.  If at any point your  dog  is repeatedly unsuccessful,  retur to the previous step. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Provided you've got a reliable stimulus that causes your dog to 
bark, he can lear this trick in one session. 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
I'VE CREATED A BARKING MONSTER!

1 Start with your dog in a down  (page  16)  position,  facing you.  Kneel down in front  of him, 
holding a treat to the side of his head opposite the direction you wish him to roll. 
2 Move the treat from his nose toward his shoulder blade while telling him to  "roll over." 
This should lure your dog to roll on his side. Praise and release the treat. 
óWhen you are ready to move to the next  step, continue the motion with your hand as you 
move the treat from his shoulder blade toward his backbone. This should lure him to roll 
onto  his back, and over to his other side.  Reward the moment he lands on his opposite 
side. 
4As he improves, use a more subtle hand gesture. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Practice five  to  ten times per session,  and in two weeks your dog 
could be rolling over on cue! 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
MY  DOG IS SQUIRMING. BUT NOT ROLLING ONTO HIS SIDE 
It's all about your hand position. You want  his neck arched as if his nose were

When playng dead, your dog rolls onto his back with his legs in the air. He remains 
�dead"  until you  cue  his miraculous  recovery.  Stick  'em up or you're a dead dog! 
1 Teach this trick after your dog has had some exercise and is ready to rest. Put your dog in 
a down (page  16) and kneel in front of him.  Hold a treat to the side of his head and move 
it toward his shoulder blade,  as you did when teaching roll over  (page 31).  Your dog 
should fall to his side. 
2 Continue to roll him to his back by gUiding his midsection.  Praise him and give him a 
belly scratch while he is on his back. Reinforce the verbal cue by saying  �good bang." 
óAs your dog improves,  try  to lure him into position with the treat only, without touching 
him.  If he is likely to roll completely over instead of stopping half way,  stop him with 
your hand on his  chest.  and then slowly release your grp so that he holds the  position  on 
his  own. 
4 Practice  this skill until you are able to elicit the  behavior with the  "bang!" cue and hand 
signal.  Your  dog should stay in this position until he is  released with  "OK" or  "you are 
healed!" or some other release word. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  This position can be a little  awkward for your dog,  and will take 
some  getting used to. Practice in combination with roll over,  so your dog understands the

Chapter  3  Tie  for  Chores 
Dogs and people have  lived in symbiotic relationships throughout history, each 
providing the other with valuable services.  People provide food, shelter, and veterinary 
care,  while  dogs traditionally  served humans by  offering  protection,  hunting assistance, 
flock tending, vermin control, and transportation by carts and sleds. In today' s modem 
world, your dog may not be expected to serve in these traditional capacities, but that 
doesn't mean he gets a free  ride!  Your dog can still earn his keep by helping around the 
house with these modern chores. 
Dogs need something to do. They want to feel useful and love to work for praise and a 
sense of accomplishment.  In this chapter, you '1I leam some useful tricks that can 
become part  of your dog's daily chores.  Sure, it will take efort to teach your dog.  but 
think of the  time you'll save  each da  when your dog fetches your mornin  news�r, 
trings your slippers, and tidies up his toys into his toy tox!  (Feel free to try tliese out 
on your kids.) 
Your dog will be most enthusiastic to do his chores ifhe feels they are important jobs. 
When he brings you the  morning paper, take a moment to appreciate this wonderful 
service instead of casually tossing the paper on the table.  When he  carries your purse, 
don't let him get away with dropping or chewing it. This is a valuable item!  And  if he 
proudly ofers you two  slippers from different pairs go ahead and wear them with pride! 
After all, what' s more  important than the feelings of your best friend?

ó Once your dog is conditioned to retrieve one specific shoe,  repeat the exercise with a

VERBAL  CUE 
Get your leash 
Your dog will fetch his leash from it's regular spot, either upon your command or whenever 
he wants to go for a walk. 
1 Introduce the word "leash"  to your dog by using it each time you put it on him. Toss his 
leash playfully and tell him to  "fetch leash"  (page 24). You'll want to secure the metal 
clasp within the leash so your dog doesn't bonk himself in the head with it in his 
exuberance!  Foring a circle with the leash by buckling the clasp onto the handle is not 
always  a good idea, as the dog can get tangled in the loop. 
2 Now put the leash in its regular spot.  such as on a hook by the door.  Point to it and 
encourage your  dog to  "get your leash!" Maneuvering the leash of the  hook may  be a 
little tricky, so be ready to help coax it off if your dog is having  trouble.  Reward your 
dog by immediately buckling his leash to his  collar and taking him out for a walk.  In this 
trck,  the  reward is a walk instead of a treat, so be sure to introduce  this concept early on. 
óThe next time you are  ready to go for a walk,  get your dog excited io go  out,  and  then 
have  him get  his leash before  leaving. 
WHAT TO EXPECT: Don't be surprsed if your dog interupts your TV show by

convincing your dog to hold the leash for an extended time,  especially when there are 
tempting smells to sniff.  Your dog will enjoy  the freedom of holding his own leash, and 
may even test your rules by  trying to take the leash from  your hand as you walk. This is

HAND  SICNAL 
When saying hs prayers, your dog places his front paws on the edge of a bed or chair, 
lowers his forequarters as in a bow, and hides his head between his arms. 
1 Kneeling sideways in front of your dog,  cue  him to put his paws on your arm (page 
198). When you reward this behavior, do so with a treat from your other hand positioned 
between your dog's paws,  so that he must bow his head for the treat.  Start by requiring 
only a mild bowing of his head,  and be sure to give the treat while your dog is in the 
correct position-with bowed head. 
2 Now practice on a chair. Have your dog put his paws up, cue him with "prayers," and 
position a treat below his forearms.  Using the  "bow"  cue  (page  164) may help him get 
the  idea to lower his forequarters. 
óAs he improves,  have your dog wait a few  seconds before releasing the treat from your

When told to kennel up, your dog goes into his crate. 
1 A crate provides a den for your dog,  which instinctually feels safe. Your dog's kennel is 
his personal space and he deserves to be left alone while inside. Blankets and a cover 
make it cozy and comfortable. 
2 Allow your dog to approach a new kennel on his own. Tossing a few treats inside may 
entice  him to explore it further.  Once he is comfortable with his crate,  toss a treat inside 
as you tell him to  �kennel up." Praise him for going inside. 
ó Now that he looks forward to this command,  tell  him to  �kennel up"  without tossing a 
treat inside. Once he goes in the crate, immediately praise him and give him a treat. 
Remember to give the treat while he is inside the kennel, as  this is the position you wish

including perfumes and cigarettes.  Leather purses are a favorite. 
MY  DOG SOMETIMES DROPS THE PURSE AS WE WALK 
Once your dog has been charged with carrying your purse,  he is responsible for it 
until you accept it back.  Sometimes, your dog will put it down for a minute to 
swallow or scratch-do not judge too harshly, but insist that he pick it back up. 
MY  DOG  CHEWS THE PURSE 
Hunting breeds are bred for soft mouths, while other breeds may be more prone to 
chewing. With any  dog you're probably going to  get some teeth marks on your 
purse  eventually. Try to think of them as  �character marks! " 
MY DOG TRIES Å GET THE TREATS OUT OF MY PURSE HIMSELF 
The treats need to be inaccessible.  Tr a zippered pouch. 
TIP! Dogs ascertain objects that have  importance to you:  purse,  wallet,  cell phone, car 
keys. They will enjoy the responsibility of carrying these items. 
STEPS: 
"Somelmes, I get to carry the car keys. I can make the alann go of If I bite the keychalnjust right!"

Tidy Up Your Toys 
TEACH IT: 
VERBAL  CUE 
Tidy up 
When tidying up, your dog opens his toy box lid, puts his toys  inside, and closes the lid. 
First, teach the skill of putting the toys into the toy box and add to the trick later by teaching 
the opening and closing of the lid. 
PUrrING AWAY THE TOY: 
1 Scatter a few  plush toys around the room and instruct your dog to fetch  (page 24). 
2 When your dog returns with a toy, offer him a treat held a few inches above the open toy 
box.  As he opens his mouth for the  treat,  the toy should fall right  in.  Praise  this success! 
3 As your dog improves,  stand behind the toy box with your treat tucked away.  When your 
dog returns with a toy, point to the toy box and instruct him to drop it  (page 26). At frst, 
reward  each successful drop in the box,  and later require several toys to be deposited 
before rewarding. 
OPENING THE LID: 
1 Attach a thick,  knotted rope to the toy box lid on the edge nearest the opening. The  rope 
should be long enough so that when your dog  pulls it from behind he is not hit by the lid. 
2 Set your dog behind the toy box and instruct him to pulon the rope  (page  73). At first, 
reward any rope pull, but as your dog improves he should be required to pull  the lid 
completely open. 
CLOSING THE LID: 
1 Kneel down holding the lid straight up and encourage your dog to nose or paw it. When 
he  does,  allow the lid to fall  closed and reward him. Lay a dish towel across the rim of 
the toy box to avoid a frightening slam. 
2 Next, open the  lid completely and instruct your dog to  �close it."  He will try  a variety of 
actions such as nosing it,  pawing it,  or pulling  the rope.  Help him be  successful  by lifing 
the  lid  a few  inches and encouraging him to put  his nose underneath. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Once all three elements have been taught,  practice  them in 
sequence:  open the  lid,  put away the toys, close the  lid.  Add this trick to your dog's daily 
chores, and you'll be the envy of the neighborhood!

Roll Yourself in a Blanket

HAH9II0KAL
Your dog takes his blanket in his mouth and rolls over, wrapping himself up. He fnishes 
with his head down,  ready for night-night. 
1 Select a blanket about two times the length of your dog. Note the direction your dog 
predominately rolls. If he rolls onto his left shoulder, face him and instruct him to lie 
down  (page  16) on the  blanket so that the majority of it is to his left.  Bunch  it up near his 
head so  it will be easier for  him to grab. 
2 Lif the comer of the blanket and cue him to take it  (page 24). Praise and reward him 
qUickly when he takes the blanket in his mouth. Be sure to only  reward if you take the 
blanket from his mouth, and not if he drops it on his own.  Encourage him to stay down 
while being rewarded. 
3 Once  he is able to take the blanket and  hold it,  cue  him to roll over (page  31).  Dogs often 
release the object in their mouth when instructed to rollover.  If this  happens,  offer neither 
praise nor reprimand-simply put your dog back and try again. 
4After a rollover is achieved with the blanket  still  in his mouth,  instruct your dog to put 
his head down (page 56). 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  This trick is deceptively diffcult, as your dog will need to execute 
each behavior perfectly in order to wrap  himself up.  As your dog progresses,  give the 
�night-night" verbal cue at  the beginning,  and then each individual cue. In time, you will 
drop the individual cues.

Chapter  4  Funny Dog 
Laugh and your dog laughs with you  . . .  even if you're laughing at  him!  One of the 
joys of dog cohabitation is the unabashed silliness your  dog infuses into everyday life. 
Just as  obedience is a crucial  part of a successful living arrangement with a dog,  so too 
are silly tricks  an integral part of the bonding process. 
If you want your dog to be well behaved and obey your commands, take an obedience 
class.  But if you want your dog to honk a horn, play the piano,  pick your pocket, and 
hide his head under a cushion then read this chapter!  People won't be able  to resist 
laughing as your playful pooch entertains a crowd with his antics! 
Although these tricks look like pure silliness,  they are  based upon sound training

1 Using a cushion that is affixed to a chair back or sofa,  show your dog a treat and place it 
underneath, near the front.  Encourage him to  "get it!" 
2 Gradually place the treat  farther toward the rear of the cushion, so that your dog has  to 
bury his entire head underneath to get the treat. Introduce the verbal cue. 
3 Continuing in the  same training session, cue your dog in the same way. but without 
placing a treat  under the  cushion.  As your dog sniffs  around undereath, reach under the 
cushion from the rear, and give your dog a treat.  As he improves, hold the treat in your 
fist for a second, instructing him to  "wait,  wait"  before releasing it. 
4 Have your dog hold his head under the cushion for a few seconds before reaching down 
and giving  him the treat,  releasing it under the cushion. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  It is especially important in this trick to reward your dog while he 
is in the correct position.  Rewarding him any place other than under the cushion will  cause 
him to develop a habit of pulling his head out early to check for his treat.  It is also 
preferable that you stand behind the chair, so as  not to tempt your dog to pull his head out 
to look at you.

This pitiable performance can garner a free  hot dog or maybe even a hot date! 
1 Stand facing your leashed dog and loop the free end of the leash under his front  wrist, 
suspending it in the air. 
2 Encourage your dog to come toward you,  saying "come on boy,  limp." Praise and reward 
even one  step with his free front  leg. Allow your dog to rest between attempts. 
3 Lighten your grip on the leash and use qUick jerks rather than sustained force  to 
encourage your dog's wrist up. Have him walk a few  steps now before rewarding. 
4Fashion a sling out of fabrc and loop it through your dog's collar so that  it suspends his 
wrist. Smart dogs will figure out that they can lower their head to get out of this mess,  so 
keep your dog's attention high as you lure him forward  with a treat.  You want your dog 
to be successful, so only ask him to do a distance he can achieve. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  This trick is physically as well  as mentally tiring for your dog.  It 
takes  concentration for him to remember to keep the one paw lifted.  As in every case  where 
you are physically manipulating your dog, do so gently and reassurngly so as  not to 
intimidate him.  This trick can take months to master.

Your dog will  play a standard or toy piano by pounding the keys with his paws.  Relaxing, 
isn't it?

soon as he places a paw  anywhere on the piano,  immediately give him the treat and 
praise  him.  Be  sure  the treat is given while  your  dog is still standing on the  piano. 
2 The next step is to get your dog to raise and lower his paws on the piano. This will require 
precise timing and positioning on your part.  Lure him into position, so that both paws are 
resting on the piano keys.  Encourage him to lif one  paw,  by either telling him to 
�shake"  (page 22) or by tapping the back side of his paw. Reward him when he puts the 
paw back down on the piano.  His tendency will be to to put his paw down behind the 
piano, on the floor,  so use your treat to keep his attention forward. 
3 Practice  one  paw at a time,  switching back and forth with every successful  key press. 
Sometimes,  it helps to lean your body in the opposite direction of the  lifted paw.  Praise 
should be given for placing the paw down on the  piano,  rather than for lifting it. 
4 Stand back and let your dog play on his own!  Substitute the �music"  cue for  �shake" and

World's Dumbest Dog 
TEACH IT: 
There are  many variations to this trick based  upon  the premise that through performance art 
your dog responds to subtle cues making it appear that he  is doing something opposite  of 
what he has been instructed.  Below are four examples: 
1  "Jump,  Fido, jump through the hoop of fire! "  Your dog instead hides his eyes.  How is this 
pulled off?  First of all, Fido's cue for jumping through a hoop is  "hup"  and not  "jump. "  
Secondly,  "Fido" is not your dog's name, and thirdly, your dog is responding to your 
subtle hand signal cueing him to cover hs  eyes (page  200).  Finish this skit by  saying 
"Fido,  that cute French poodle is watching  the show . . .   "  and signalling him to jump into 
action and through the hoop! 
2 "Fido is such a well-behaved dog;  he never goes in the  trash." Upon turning your back to 
him your dog runs immediately to the wastebasket.  How is this done? A treat is placed in 
the wastebasket, and your dog is told to stay.  Upon hearing his release command, such as 
the word  "OK" used while speaking to your audience,  he will eagerly run to the  trash. 
3 "Where did my dog go? Has anyone seen himT  As you scan the  audience your dog peeks 
out from between your legs. Your dog,  of course, is responding to your peekaboo  (page 
52)  signal. 
4 "Jump through the hoop!"  To your feigned embarrassment, your dog plays dead on the 
floor. Your dog responded to your hand signal to play dead (page 32). 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  One of the  more  difcult elements in this trick is getting your dog 
to perform a behavior behind your back,  without eye  contact.  Dogs often will run around to 
look into your face. Paitern train your dog by training the exact same way every  time. 
TIP! Watch for signs of anxiety in your dog when teaching a new trick:  scratching, 
yawning,  licking his lips, looking away. 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
MY  DOG HAS TROUBLE STAYING STILL 
Eye contact can be a powerful cue for your dog-make contact when you want

Chapter  5  Modern  Conveniences 
Contemporary  dogs  have  become full-fledged  family  members in  today' s 
households;  sleeping on beds, wearing clothing, and eating gourmet meals.  Skills once 
required  of outdoor dogs have been replaced by a more practicable set of skills geared 
toward today' s modern living. While a dog's ability to hunt for your dinner used to be 
of great importance, it is now more often appreciated when a dog can find the remote 
control, answer the  telephone.  and especially bring you a cold one from the fridge! 
There is something about a dog doing �people things" that we humans find  endearing. 
When we teach a dog to respond to a cue with a natural behavior (such as fetching). we 
have taught him to associate a word with a particular action.  When we teach a dog to 
execute a �people behavior," we have taught him not only the word but a complex idea 
involving logic and non-instinctive physical responses. 
But let's be honest.  The tricks in this chapter are not ofen taught merely to improve a 
dog's gray matter. They are  taught for two reasons:  to impress your friends and to save 
you a trip  to the  kitchen when you're thirsting for a beer!

Turn Of the Light 
TEACH IT: 
VERBAL  CUE 
Lights 
Your dog will learn to paw a light switch on the wall.  turning the lights on or off.  A fat, 
rocker light switch is easiest,  especially for flipping the switch to the up  position.  Small 
dogs may require a stool placed  under the switch. 
1 Hold a treat against the wall a little above the light switch and encourage your dog with 
�lights, get it!" Let him have the treat when he  is able to reach the switch. 
2 Hold the treat a little above the switch and away from the wall while tapping the switch 
with your other hand. Encourage your dog up again, but keep the treat clenched in your 
fist until  he paws once  or twice against the  wall.  Praise him and give him the treat  while 
he  is still upright. 
3 Tap the switch plate while cueing your dog,  then put your hands down and allow your 
dog to paw at  the wall by himself. As he  improves, challenge your dog to make a 
successful switch fip  before he is rewarded. 
4 Finally, stand across the room and send your dog by himself to kill the lights! 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  "Get the lights on your way out, will you?" An energetic dog can 
pick up the concept of scratching the wall pretty quickly, however the nuances of fipping 
the  switch will take more time.

HOW DO I TEACH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TURNING THE LIGHT 
ON AND  OFF? 
Your dog will not  have the fine motor skills in this position to maneuver the 
switch one  way or  the other.  He will just paw at  the  switch uniil you  let  him know 
he  was  successful.

OpenClose H Door 
TEACH IT: 
VERBAL  CUE 
Open Close 
Your dog opens a door using the handle. and pushes it closed with his paws. 
OPEN THE DOOR: 
1 Place your dog in front  of an outward opening door with a lever door handle.  Something 
desirous should be on the other side of the door,  such as access to the outdoors,  food 
treats,  or a favorite toy.  Have  the  door  open a crack and encourage your dog to  push  his 
way through to get to the reward. 
2 Hold the  door slightly ajar,  and encourage your dog to push it open.  He will need to paw 
at it or jump on it to get it  open  this time. When he  does, release  the  door, allowing it to 
open and giving your dog  access to  his  reward. 
3 Close the door completely and tap the door handle while encouraging your dog up.  If he 
paws at the handle, subtly depress it and allow it to open. 
4 Now that your dog understands the  handle is the  secret to opening doors, he will perfect 
his technique  on his own,  given enough incentive on  the  other side! 
5 Once your dog has mastered the  outward opening door, try it with an inward opening one. 
Tape the  latch so the door opens without depressing the  handle. Your dog first needs to 
learn to lean on the  handle and walk backward.  Stand on the other side of the door with a 
treat or toy and call to your dog while tapping on the door. 
6 Remove the tape from the  latch and again stand on the  opposite side of the door. Keep 
your foot  pressed against it so that  if your dog depresses the handle at all, the  door will 
open toward him. Your dog will learn to walk backward while depressing the door 
handle. 
BUILD  ON IT!  Build on these skills by teaching brig me Bbeer from the fridge 
(page  74). 
TIP!  Short dogs may need a stepping stool to help them reach the  door handle. 
1 Have your dog push through the door crack. 
2 Hold the door ajar while your dog paws at  it. 
3 Depress the handle when your dog paws it. 
4Give your dog incentive to open it on his own. 
STEPS: 
CLOSE THE DOOR: 
1 Using a slightly ajar inward  opening door,  hold a treat at nose height against the door and 
encourage your  dog to  "close,  get it!" When he shows interest,  raise your hand higher 
against the  door.  It  shouldn't take  much coaxing for your dog to place  his paws against 
the  door  while  reaching for the  treat.  This will push the  door closed.  Immediately  give 
your  dog the  treat  and  praise  him.  If he is frightened by the sound of the  closing  door  and 
does not take his  treat,  encourage  him back up on the  closed door and reward him while 
he  is in the correct position,  on two paws. 
8 Once your dog has the hang of this,  try merely tapping the  door to get him to push on it. 
Reward him for pushing the  door closed. 
9 Finally, from a distance send your dog to  "close"  the door. Don't be surprised ifhe slams 
it shut in his eagerness! 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Door handles have bafled  dogs throughout the  ages.  Opening a 
door requires both logic skills and coordination and can take a dog several weeks or more  to 
master.  Closing the door is much easier and can actually be a fun game for your dog!

Ring H Bell to Come Inside 
TEACH IT: 
VERBAL  CUE 
Bell 
Your dog noses or paws a bell on the door when he wants to go in or out. 
1 Wiggle a bell on the  floor and encourage your dog to  "get it!" Mark the  instant he touches 
the bell with his nose or paw by saying "good bell"  and offering a treat. 
2 Hang the bell  from a doorknob  at  a low height and encourage your dog to ring it by 
saying  "bell, get it!" You may need to hold a treat behind the bell,  and tease him with it. 
As soon as the bell makes a sound, praise and reward him. 
3 Get your dog's leash and get him excited to go for a walk.  Stop at the door with the bell, 
encouraging him to ring  it. It may take a while, as he will be distracted by the idea of his 
walk.  As soon as he  touches  the  bell,  immediately open the door and take him for a walk. 
In this trick, the reward is a walk instead of a treat, so be sure to introduce this concept 
early on. 
4As you return home from your walk,  get him excited to go inside \ith promises of a treat 
or dinner. Again, have  him paw at a bell hung from the door before opening it.  It could 
take several minutes to ring the bell, so practice when you are not in a hurry. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Consistency in enforcing the bell  to go in/out rule will speed up the 
learning process. You'll also  need  to be very responsive to the  bells in the  beginning--if 
you hear them  ringing, rush to open the  door. This method of communicating sure beats 
barking and scratching at the door,  so try to reward his politeness with a walk as often as 
possible.

Pull on H Rope 
r 
TEACH IT: 
Whether for opening a fence or pulling a wagon,  your dog's skill at pu  ng on a rope will 
have endless uses. 
1 Introduce your dog to pu  ng on a rope by playing tug-of-war. Pet stores sell toys and 
ropes for this purpose, or an old  towel  works well, too. Tell your dog  to  �tug"  and wiggle 
the toy side to side or pull sporadically. 
2 Switch  to a knotted rope. Let your dog occasionally pull it from your hands to keep his 
enthusiasm for the  game. 
3 Tie the  end of the rope to a cardboard box and let him drag it around. As this is not as 
self-rewarding as the tugging game,  be  sure  to praise and  reward your dog for his efforts. 
4 Use  this newfound skill to have your dog pull  a wagon with your goceries, pull open 
doors, or pull a rope to ring a bell. With a little imagination, your buddy will be the envy 
of the  neighborhood! 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Bull breeds and terriers are naturals for this irick,  but all dogs love 
a good  pull  now and then.  The  more this exercise feels like a game, the faster your dog will 
catch on.  Play daily and within a week your dog  could  be pulling his weight!

OPEN THE REFRIGERATOR: 
1 Practice pull on Brope (page  73)  with a dish towel. Tie the dish towel to the refrigerator 
handle.  With the fridge door slightly ajar, instruct your dog to  pull the  dish towel.  All 
four paws should remain on the foor while your dog pulls-to protect your door as well 
as to keep him from pushing against himself.  Make it more  challenging by closing the 
fridge  door completely. 
GET THE BEER: 
1 Empty a beer can. 
2 Play fetch (page 24) with the empty can to get your dog accustomed to carrying it. As 
many dogs are  reluciant to hold metal in their mouths,  a foam can insulator may help. 
3 Place the beer can on a low shelf in an open,  uncluttered refrigerator and have your dog 
fetch it. Reward him with a treat tastier than anything he may fnd in the fridge. 
CLOSE THE REFRIGERATOR: 
1  Cue your dog to close the door  (page 71) while tapping the front of the open refgerator 
door.

and  tell your dog  "keys, fetch"  (page  24). When he  returs with  the keys,  open the pouch 
and reward him with a treat from inside. As he  cannot  open  the pOllch on his own, he  will 
learn to bring it hurriedly to you.  The scent of the treats in the change purse will  help 
your dog find your keys. 
2 Next, hide the  keys farther away.  or in the next  room.  Make a game  of it and help your 
dog search room to room.  The next time you lose your keys, you'll be glad you put in the 
effort  of teaching this trick! 
REMOTE: 
1 A hard plastic remote is not an object that most dogs take readily in their mouths, so you 
may wish to wrap it in masking tape during the learning process.  Show the remote to 
your dog and tell your dog  "remote,  take it"  (page 24). Praise him and exchange it for a 
treat. 
2 Set it on the coffee table,  point to it,  and say "remote, fetch." 
3 Set this trick in a realistic context.  Sit in your armchair and set the  remote in a commonly 
found spot.  Have your dog fetch it and bring it to your chair. Your guests will be amazed 
by this useful trick! 
WHAT TO EXPECT: Although teaching your dog to retrieve a named object is not a 
complicated process, the  challenge in this trick will be keeping your dog's motivation high 
when the object you are having him seek is not a toy or treat.  Be sure to give  lots of praise

Push a Shopping Cart 
TEACH IT: 
VERBAL  CUE 
Paws up 
Forward 
Dogs doing  "people things"  are always entertaining.  Standing on his hind legs. your dog 
will push a shopping cart, baby carriage, or toy lawn mower (depending on his size and 
your household chores! ). 
PAWS UP: 
1 Hold a treat slightly above a sturdy piece of furiture and tell your dog  "paws up." Pat the 
item to  coax your dog's front  feet  onto  it. Hold the  treat  only slightly behind  its  edge, so 
as not to encourage your dog to jump  on top or over it. 
2 With both his paws on the item, allow your dog to take the treat. 
3 Now try it with a bar.  Stand facing your dog,  holding the bar between you.  Show your 
dog a treat held in your mouth,  and instruct him "paws up." As he rests his paws on the 
bar,  allow him to take the treat from your mouth,  or,  if you prefer, spit it into his mouth. 
FORWARD: 
1 With your dog's paws on the bar,  tell him  "forward"  as you walk backward.  The height of 
the bar should cause your dog to be in a fairly upright position. 
2 Select a cart or carriage of appropriate height for your dog.  You may need to add weight 
to the basket to prevent your dog from  tipping it over.  Cover the grating  under the handle 
with a towel to prevent the possibility of your dog's paws getting stuck in it. Stand to the 
side of the cart and hold it to prevent it from  rolling.  Tap the handle and tell him  "paws 
up."  Hold a treat in front  of him and coax him  "forward. " Reward your dog for his first 
steps,  and  remember to always give the reward while  the  dog is  still  in the  correct 
position, standing up. 
3 Stand at the opposite end of the cart and use a treat near your dog's nose to lure him 
forward. Over time, lighten your grasp on the cart and  soon your dog will  be shopping on 
his own! 
WHAT TO EXPECT: A grassy surface works well for this trick,  as it will slow the cart

1 A treat ball toy sold in pet stores is a hollow plastic ball with a hole that, when rolled. 
randomly releases treats.  Fill it with kibble or goldfish crackers and allow your dog a few 
days to play with  it  on  his own.  It will likely become a favorite toy. 
2 Point  to an  empty treat  ball and tell your dog  "soccer!" When he  rolls the  ball a few feet, 
toss a treat near the ball for him to fnd. 
3 Gradually require longer roll times before rewarding, and  switch to rewarding from your 
hand  instead  of tossing the treat. 
4 Substitute a soccer ball,  giving the same verbal cue and rewarding for a short roll. 
Gradually build up the distance.

then goes long for the catch. 
1 Drop a plush football in front of your dog and tell him to  "hike! "  He  won't know what 
you want, but your excited tone will encourage him to try different things:  picking it up, 
dropping it, throwing it in the air,  barking,  bringing it to you,  pawing  it. When he  touches 
it with his paw,  mark that instant by  exclaiming  "good!" and qUickly giving him a treat. 
2 Gradually require him to paw harder at the football in order to earn the treat.  Continue to

3 Chain several behaviors together:  have him drop  (page  26)  the fooiball, bow  (page  164), 
"hike," and then catch  (page 92) after you throw it. Your dog's possessiveness of his toy 
may lead him automatically to  cover it with  his paws when doing his bow.  If not, your 
dog will  learn in time that  "hike"  comes after  "bow"  and will cover the ball in 
preparation for this next cue. 
WHAT TO EXPECT: This trick can be frustrating for you and your dog at the beginning, 
as he  needs to experiment with different  behaviors until he stumbles upon the desired one. 
Your timing in marking the instant he gives the behavior is crucial. Have patience; with 
consistent training your dog could become a gridiron great!

1 Set the net of a toy basketball stand low enough that your dog can reach it while standing 
on four paws.  Toss o toy  basketball for him to fetch  (page 24). 
2 Coax him toward a treat held against the backboard while telling him to �dunk." 
3 As he reaches toward the treat,  command him to "drop it"  (page  26).  He should release 
the  ball  into the net as he opens his mouth for the treat. 
4At first,  reward him for dropping the  ball anywhere near the net.  As he improves, require 
a successful basket before  rewarding. 
5 Challenge your dog further by tapping the backboard instead of holding a treat against it. 
As your dog progresses, the verbal cue  �dunk"  will  come to mean the entire action of 
fetching the ball and dropping it in the net. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Practice this trick ten times per session,  keeping the training 
energetic and fun. Within a few days you'll likely see some progress. Real athletes will be

action.  Select an object  that is easy for your dog to  catch,  such as a plush toy.  Play keep� 
away with it for  a minute, then toss it to your dog and say "catch!" Praise him, repeating 
the  cue  "good catch, good catch. " Treats are  not used  in this  trick, as catching is a self­
rewarding activity. 
2 Have your dog sit (page  15). while you back up and toss the toy to him.  Vary the toys and 
balls,  cueing  "catch"  each time. 
3 Now it's time to place the net behind your dog and whack the ball to him with a hockey 
stick. You don't want to hurt your dog,  so use soft, easy to  catch  balls that are too large 
to be swallowed. 
4 After catching your shot, your dog will probably engage in a victory lap around the yard. 
The  trick now is to get him to position himself back in front  of the net.  With a cleverly 
placed target object (page  145) in the  center of the  net,  cue him to touch the  target.  As 
soon as he does, yell  "catch"  and whack the  ball  to him,  which serves as his reward.

When you tell your dog to  �go hde," he  hides behind any object. A big dog trying to hide 
behind a skinny pole is always  good for a laugh! 
1 This trick is  picked up easiest by toy-motivated dogs.  Get your dog excited with a game 
of fetch (page 24). 
2 Set a large object, such as an uptured picnic table.  in your play area.  Show your dog a 
treat and tell him to  "go hide"  as you toss it behind the  table.  Praise him for going behind 
the  table, then immediately get his attention and toss his toy into the yard. The toy serves 
as his  reward.  while the treat is merely used to cause him to go  to the  corect place. 
3 Wean off the treats as you just tell him to  "go hide"  and point to the table. Your dog may 
only go  half way to  the  table, in which case walk toward him  as  you  keep pointing and 
cueing.  You may even  have  to walk all the way to the  table to get him to go behind  it 
Don't reward him with his  toy until he  is in the  correct  spot.  The  toy is his  incentive, and 
the  more  he wants  it.  the qUicker he will lear.

1  f. 
When presented with your two closed fists, your dog sniffs  each and indicates which hand 
holds the treat. 
1 Using a treat with a strong smell,  such as hot dogs, place it slightly exposed in one  of 
your two fists.  Face your dog with your fsts at his chest height.  Ask him �which hand?" 
and encourage him to  "get  it!" 
2 When your dog shows  interest in the  correct hand, either by nosing it for a few  seconds or 
pawing it, say  "good! " and open your hand to allow him to take the treat.  Repeat with the 
treat in  the other hand. 
3 If your dog shows  interest in the wrong hand,  tell him  "whoops," open that hand to show 
him it is empty.  and stop the trick.  Wait  30 seconds before trying again so that there are 
negative consequences to his incorrect choice. 
4 Increase the  difficulty by covering the treat entirely with your hand, while still leaving an 
air hole for your dog  to sniff. 
0 Wait  until your  dog is consistently choosing the  correct hand before changing his 
indicator requirement from  nosing  your fst  to pawing  at  it. Keep your fists  low to the 
ground. When  your dog has indicated his  choice with his  nose,  pull your other hand back 
and encourage him to paw at your correct hand by saying  "get it!" 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  This trick involves two of your dog's favorite  things:  using his  nose

to indicate the scent he is to search.  Place the treat a few feet away on the floor and send 
him to  � find it!" Praise  him when he does. 
2 Repeat this game again, placing the treat a little farther away. Always return to your dog 
before releasing him from his stay as he may otherwise develop a bad habit of sneaking 
while you are out of sight. 
3 Place  the  treat out in the  open,  in the next room.  Many dogs will use this  opportunity to 
try to sneak into your room  (thinking you won't notice! ).  Have a friend  monitor your 
dog,  or return to him frequently to ensure he stays  put.  If your dog seems confused. 
encourage him by running with him toward the treat.  Increase the  diffculty of hiding 
places as your dog improves. Monitor his success, as you don't want  him to become

Your dog maneuvers rings  onto an upright pole. 
1 Introduce your dog to the pole by tapping it and saying "target"  (page  145). Practice the 
target skill a few times by  rewarding your dog each time  he  touches  the  pole. 
2 Plastic diving rings can be purchased at pool supply stores.  Hand your dog a ring and 
have  him take it  (page 24). You'll want  him to  hold  the north side of the  ring,  with  it 
circling his chin. 
3 With the ring  in his mouth, cue your dog to touch the target. 
4 Once your dog is  able to touch the target while holding the ring  in his mouth, offer his 
treat near the  top  ofihe  pole and  instruct him to drop it  (page  26). Reward  your dog for 
dropping  the  ring anywhere  near the  pole. 
0As your dog improves,  reward him only for dropping the ring onto the pole. Tap the pole 
to focus his attention and lure his head forward with a treat until the bottom of the ring 
catches on the  pole. Tell him to  �drop it"  and immediately praise him and give  him  the 
treat if the  ring lands  on the  pole.  If the ring misses the  pole. say  �whoops!" and try 
again. 
6 Once your dog has mastered this skill, ask him to pick up the ring from the ground or 
from another pole instead of from your hand. He might pick it up holding the  south side 
of the ring, which will probably cause him to miss the pole. Through trial and error he 
will discover on his own that he  needs to  hold the north side.  If he does pick up the south 
side.  he will  learn to relax his grip. allowing the ring to swivel downward.  Dogs are very 
smart! 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Although this trick looks incredibly difcult, dogs often pick it up 
easier than you would expect! Practice only about five times per session in the  beginning,

can trick your nosy dog  as  he sniffs  out the pea! 
1 Start with just one  clay fower pot on the foor. Rub the  inside with a treat to give  it lots of

Encourage him to  �fd it! " (page 98.) When he noses or paws the pot,  praise him and 
lif it to reward him with the  treat. 
2 After your dog catches on, which shouldn't take long,  hold the pot in place and keep 
encouraging him until he paws at it. Tap his wrist or use the word  "shake"  (page 23) to 
give him the idea to use his paw. Reward any paw contact by lifting the pot.  Strive for a

3 Add two more pots and mark the scented  one so you don't forget! In a sof voice, tell your

If your dog paws at an incorrect  pot,  do not lif  it,  but rather say  "whoops"  and encourage 
him to keep looking. Use the pitch of your voice to calm your  dog as he  diligently  sniffs 
each pot and to excite him when he shows interest in the correct one. If your dog loses 
interest, qUickly lift and set back down the correct pot to show him the treat.  Hold the 
pots firmly in  place  while your dog sniffs to prevent  him from pawing  one  over by 
himself.

Dog on Point

VERBAL  CUE 
Point 
Pointing  prey is an instinctive behavior that you may have  already observed in your dog. 
When on pOint, the  dog's stance is frozen with body outstretched and tense, erect tail,  alert 
ears, and foreleg lifted with foot curled slightly into their body. 
1 Rather than training this  trick during your normal training session, be observant of a time 
when your dog exhibits this behavior naturally.  If you catch him staring intently at a bird, 
tense your body and crouch down to further engage his pack hunting instinct.  In a low 
voice,  build his intensity by saying  "what  is it? Are you gonna get it?"  Move in close but 
do not attempt to go ahead of him, as this  can cause him to break. Your goal is to keep 
him in this intense  position as long as possible. 
2 Train outdoors as it is a more stimulating environment. Toss around your dog's favorite 
ball to build his  drive.  Hold him by his collar and  toss  the  ball several yards.  Use as  few 
words as  possible so as  not  to  distract him while you get him  to  stay  (page  18) while 
standing. 
3 Walk over to the ball while keeping your eyes on your dog,  enforcing his stay. Bat the 
ball around to pique his interest. Release your dog with "OK!" to pounce on his prey. 
Because his release  will come  at  random times,  he will  learn to tense his  body and point 
in anticipation of the pounce. 
4As your dog improves at holding pOint, encourage good form  by stroking the  underside of 
his tail and tapping his paw.

Hup 
As you kneel on the foor, your dogjumps over your raised thigh. 
1 With your dog on your left,  kneel  on the  ground with your right leg outstretched.  Rest 
your foot against a wall. Lure your dog over your leg with a treat.  Tell him  �hup! "  as he 
moves over your leg.  If he attempts to go under your leg, move your leg lower. 
2 Raise your leg up a little higher. Your dog may be tempted to cross near your ankle as 
that is the lowest spot, so keep your treat close to your body to tempt him in that 
direction. An enthusiastic voice will stimulate  a higher jump! 
3 Kneel with your thigh horizontal and your knee against the wall. If your dog tries to go 
under your leg, lure him slowly so that he first  places his front  paws on your thigh.  Allow 
him to nibble the treat from this position, then move the treat farther away from him and 
use an enthusiastic  �hup! "  to coax him to jump the rest of the way. 
4 Move away  from the wall and use a sweeping motion of your right arm to signal your dog 
to jump over your knee. 
WHAT TO EXPECT: This is a fun trck for your dog, and one that can be achieved by 
most  dogs.  Practice when your dog is full  of energy  and he  should get  the  hang  of it in a

In an impressive show of athleticism and teamwork, your dog jumps over your crouched 
back. 
1 Stand next to the upright while you have your dogjump over a bar (page  108). Set the 
bar height to about 24"  (61 em). 
2 This  time,  crouch down next to the upright. 
3 Kneel on your hands and knees under the bar and instruct your dog to jump.  If he  is 
reluctant, have a friend encourage him over.  If your dog has trouble at any point learning 
this trick,  go  back to the previous step. 
4Remove the bar from jump.  but keep yourself positioned between the uprights.  Alternate 
jumps with the bar and without  it. 
0 Continuing in the  same  training session, lay the uprights down and have your dogjump 
you again. 
6 Remove the jump entirely.  If your dog seems confused, hold the bar across your back as a 
visual cue. 
1 Once your dog is comfortable jumping over your body, move  away from him and stand 
with your back to him, arms extended.  Look back at him and call  "hup!" As your dog 
runs toward you, wait until the last second to  crouch down. Very impressive!  
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Athletic dogs can be jumping over you within a few weeks.  Be sure 
your dog has good traction and is jumping with control.  Send him to a target  (page  145) 
after each jump to keep his trajectory straight. A few  repetitions of this trick per day are

1 Sit in a chair and encourage your dog to jump into your lap by patting your thighs and 
saying  "hup!" A toy or treat  should  help  motivate  him.  Be sure to catch him securely and 
praise and reward him while in your lap.  If your  dog enjoys being held, this can be his 
reward.

MY DOG DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY 
If your dog is toy motivated, this will often inspire more enthusiasm than food. 
Tease him with a toy.  and when he jumps,  toss the toy a few inches and catch him! 
TIP! You get enthusiasm by giving enthusiasm. 
1 Encourage your dog into your lap.

2 Lean against a wall for support. 
3 Bend your knees slightly. 
STEPS: 
SIDEWAYS JUMP (SMALL OR LARGE DOGS): 
1 Have your dogjump over your knee  (page  109). Your dog should be on your left with 
your right knee  raised.  Hold your right hand high and away as a target for your dog,  and 
use  a toy if that helps. 
2 Rise up slightly so your back knee is off the  ground. 
3 Continue to rise until you are in a position that causes your dog to jump high enough to  be 
caught.  When your dog is at the apex of his jump, lightly touch him with both hands in 
the position that will later become your catching grasp.  Do not attempt a full  catch the 
first time,  as it will startle your dog. Increase the pressure and duration of your grasp, 
concentrating on carrying him through the path of his arc and releasing him to the 
ground. 
4Finally, catch your dog at the highest point of his jump, continuing to swing in the 
direction of his travel so as not to jolt him.  Be sure  his weight is distributed and excessive 
pressure  is not caused on his neck or belly.

Summersault/Handstand Vault 
TEACH IT: 
VERBAL  CUE 
Summersault 
This spectacular trick requires precise synchronization and complete trust as you execute a 
summersault or a handstand while your dog vaults between your legs. 
SUMMERSAULT: 
1 Your dog already knows how to jump over your back (page  1 10)  from behind you. 
Work with him now to jump the  opposite direction.  Face your dog and crouch down, 
arms extended,  head bowed but tilted so you can make eye contact. 
2 Add a slow�motion summersault. Walk toward your dog,  arms raised straight up in the 
position that will  later serve as your hand signal.  Crouch down and tell your dog 
�summersault,  hup! 
,
. Afer he jumps you put your hands on the ground, shoulder width 
apart, set your head between your hands with your chin tucked toward your chest, and 
roll forward.  Practice  this step several weeks before  moving forward, as a collision with 
your dog could set him back significantly. 
3 Your dog is now going to be asked to jump you while you are in mid-roll.  He will need to 
calculate speed and distance and may not be successful at frst. Remove your shoes in 
case of a collision.  Keep your summersault slow but continuous.  If your dog bails from 
the jump.  try  it again  and  praise  him  profusely when  he  is  successfl. 
4Finally, split your legs into a V for your dog to jump through! Your dog may  at frst be 
caught off guard when your legs separate,  and collide with them. Teach him this 
configuration by starting your summersault in a straddle and keeping your legs split all 
the way through.

2 Finish a summersault after your dog has jumped you. 
3 Try rolling while your is dogjumping. 
HANDSTAND: 
1 Practice a solo handstand;  start in a lunge, hands extended up and slightly forward.  Push 
with your front  leg as your hands go  to the ground and your back  leg  conversely goes  up. 
Your feet  should meet pointing toward the sky, then separate them into a wide V for your 
dog to jump through. Lower your head to the ground, tuck your chin toward your chest, 
and roll forward  to finish. 
2 Remove your shoes! Starting with a summersault vault, work incrementally to create  a 
higher and higher summersault.  Your first handstands should have your head lowering to 
the ground before your feet ever get straight  up. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  There will be few dog/trainer pairs that can pull this trick off.  There 
are issues of size, jumping ability.  confdence, and trust. If this is one you can master, you'll 
have the flashiest trick in town!

Hup Baton 
Your dogjumps over your baton while holding one of his own.  Creative positions can turn 
this trick into a real circus act! 
1 Warm up with your dogjumping over a bar (page  108). Stand alongside the jump and 
use a sweeping motion with the arm farthest from your dog to signal him over. 
2 Remove the jump and hold just  the bar parallel to the ground using the arm closest to your 
dog.  Cue him to  "hup"  and lure him over with a treat in your other hand.  If your dog tries 
to go  around the bar, hold the other end against a wall. 
3 Experiment with changing your body positions afer every jump in a sequence of jumps. 
Decorate your bar or use a flashy baton. 
4 Make a baton for your dog to hold. Select an object that your dog holds willingly in his 
mouth.  A length of hose or irrigation  tubing wrapped with colorful electrical tape works 
well,  as  does  a tennis ball-textured throwing stick sold at pet stores.  Associate  the word 
�baton"  with this object and have your dog take it (page  25)  and hold  his baton while he 
jumps! 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Your dog can lear the  basics of baton jumping in a few weeks. 
However, every new body position will require a learning period as you and your dog 
figure out the logistics. This collaborative effort  is a true bonding experience.

In the  same way that you jump rope, your dog hops the rope as it is swung.  Have two 
people  hold the ends of the  rope,  or hold  them both yourself as you jump with your dog. 
1 Position your dog on a doormat or piece of carpet.  Practice jump for  joy (page  175) with 
your dog landing on the mat.  Gradually work farther away from your dog,  so you are 
able to stand several feet  away while he continues to jump on  the  mat. 
2 Using a 7'   (2  m).  loose, lightweight  rope,  afx one end to an object at waist height.  With 
your dog on the  mat, slowly swing the  rope back and forth to accustom your dog to it. 
3 Cue your dog to jump for joy and attempt to swing the rope beneath him. Do not attempt 
a complete rotation with the rope.  At first, reward your dog for jumping, whether or not 
the  rope was successfully passed beneath him.  Your dog will have to learn the rhythm of 
the  rope.  In the  meantime, the  timing of your cue will be essential to a successful jump. 
4 Once your dog is able to clear the rope, it's time  to add a second swing!  If your dog has a 
long air time,  or is shorter in body, you can swing the rope slower.  Concentrate on 
swinging the  rope low and sweeping it beneath him. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  This trick can take the qUickest learer months to achieve. 
Synchronization is key to your success, and it will  take time for you and your dog to get on 
the same wavelength.  Practice in short sessions, keep up the enthusiasm, and one day you'll 
find your dog is jumping rope!  Once you've mastered a fixed-end rope jump, try holding 
both ends yourself, with your dog facing you.

Frisbee or catch 
Your dog's prey  drive  is engaged as he  chases and catches a flying disc. 
1 Use a flying disc specifically designed for a dog,  such as a Hyperfite® or Frishee® 
Fastback brand soft plastic disc, or a flexible Aerobie® Dogobie or Sof Bite Floppy 
Disc®. Hard plastic toy discs could injure your dog's mouth and teeth.  Hold it parallel to 
the ground, fingers curled under the inside edge. with your index finger slightly 
extended.  With shoulders perpendicular to your target.  pull the disc across your body, 
take a step toward your target, and bring your arm across your body. Snap your elbow 
and wrist just before you release the disc. 
2 Do not allow your dog free  access to his disc-keep it hidden away to increase its 
desirability. When your dog is in a playful mood, spin the upside-down disc in circles. 
When he shows interest, throw a �roller" -rolling the disc along its edge like a wheel. 
End the play session while your  dog's interest is still high. 
3 Once your dog is chasing the disc, encourage him to bring it back to you by clapping your 
hands and calling to him to  come  (page  19). If he does not  come,  do not chase him but 
rather turn your back and ignore him. 
4Teach your dog to catch the disc in midair by throwing it in a low, flat trajectory.  Do not 
throw it directly at your dog. 
0 Your dog needs to drop  (page 26)  the disc afer he returns to you. Try using two identical 
discs and throwing the second as soon as he drops the first. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Don't be discouraged if your dog does not immediately master an 
airborne  catch, as it could  take months to  establish this coordination.  Dogs under fourteen 
months should not be jumping for the disc, and all dogs should be checked by a veterinarian 
to ensure soundness.  Dogs should jump  in such  a way that they land with four paws on the 
ground,  rather than vertically, which can stress their spine and  rear knees.

Hold the hoop on the ground with the hand closest to your dog, tell him �hup," and lure 
him through with a treat in your other hand.  Praise him when he  is through the hoop and 
allow him to have the  treat.  Some dogs are frightened to go  through the hoop for the frst 
time, in which case  you can lead him  through with a leash. To prevent your  dog from 
going  around the  hoop,  try placing it in a doorway. 
2 As your dog gets the idea,  begin to raise the hoop off the  floor.  Dogs sometimes  get 
tangled in the  hoop, so be prepared to release it if you feel resistance. 
3 Assuming your dog has the physical ability, raise the hoop again so that your dog must 
jump to get through it. Try giving him a running start or use your hand on the opposite 
side of the hoop to lure him upward. To reduce the risk of injury  associated with your 
dog turning in midair, make a habit of tossing the treat in front  of your dog rather than 
having  him return to you for it.

1 With your dog facing you, hold treats in your left  hand behind your back, and a hoop in 
your right hand to your side.  Tell your dog to  "hup"  and reward him with a treat from 
your left  hand behind your back. 
2 Pass the hoop to your left side and tell your dog to  �hup" again, this time rewarding him 
in front of you from your right hand  (a treat bag at your waist is convenient). 
3 Introduce a second hoop. Without a free hand to gUide your dog, the turn of your head 
will signal the  correct hoop.  Lean your lef hoop on the  front  of your legs, and  hold your 
right hoop to your side.  Look toward the right hoop and move it slightly to emphasize it 
over the other hoop. Instruct your dog to jump through, and when he does, say  �good" 
but do not offer a treat.  Instead,  immediately lower your right hoop to lean on the front of 
your  legs  and hold out the  left  hoop, turning your head in that  direction and coaching

HOOP WEAVE: 
1 This trick will  look a lot like a leg weave  (page  170). Start your dog on your left side as 
you use your right hand to  hold  a hoop against  the front of your right thigh.  Step with 
your right leg as you tell your dog to  "hup!" 
2 Immediately transfer the  hoop to your left hand and hold it against your left thigh as you 
take a step.  If your dog has  trouble jumping in this  direction,  use your right hand to hold 
the  hoop  (still against your left thigh) and lure your dog through with a treat in your lef 
hand.  Practice until your dog can do a sequence of back-and-forth jumps as you walk 
forward. 
3 It's time to introduce a second  hoop. With your dog on your  left,  have your left hoop 
pressed against  the front of your body so that your  dog is seeing only its edge.  Extend 
your right hoop forward  on your right leg and have your dog jump through. As soon as 
he  is  through,  reverse hoop positions to have your right hoop  pressed  against the front of 
your body as you take a step with your left  foot. 
4 Finally, keep both hoops parallel as you extend frst one and then the other hoop while 
walking. Keep the nonactive hoop centered against its closest leg,  so that your dog 
cannot jump through it. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  As you train these tricks you will likely realize how debilitating it 
is to not have  a free  hand with which to signal. Eye contact is a powerful communication

Disobedient Dog-Under the Hoop 
VÊÑÛÑÎ LÜÊ
TEACH IT: 
In this comedy routine.  after an impressive introduction, you command your dog to jump 
through the flaming hoop!  He instead crawls under it. 
1 Set your hoop to a height higher than your dog normally jumps.  He will be tempted to 
jump through it, but gUide him carefully to instead walk under it. 
2 Set your dog on one side of the hoop while you stand on the other. Lift your toe and show 
him as you place a treat undereath.  Instruct him to  lie  dow, and then to crawl  (page 
144) under the  hoop.  Lift your shoe  as he approaches to  allow  him to take the  treat.  You 
may have to keep  repeating  "down"  and  "crawl"  throughout his travel. 
3 Keep practicing as you gradually lower the height of the hoop and introduce the verbal 
cue. 
4 In your performance, use a target object  (page  145)  to have your dog return to his 
original spot.  Repeai this trick several times before  telling your dog that the cute French 
poodle has just joined the audience, and subtly signaling him to jump the hoop's center.

Rolling Hoop Dive

VERBAL  CUE 
Get it! 
This flashy  trick is also a great workout for your dog. As hoops are sped across the grass 
your dog chases them and dives through their centers! 
1 Hold a large hoop in front  of you and have your dog hoop jump  (page  125). 
2 Walk forward  holding the hoop in front of you low to the ground, and  accustom your dog 
to jumping through a moving object. 
3 As you walk forward,  send the hoop rolling in front of you a short distance and use an 
excited tone to tell your dog to  "get it, hup! "  Your dog may run to the hoop, and run back 
to you,  not understanding.  Keep alternating between walking with the hoop and sending 
it rolling. This is the hardest stage of learning, so keep  up the enthusiasm! 
4This next  step is training for you! Practice throwing a hoop fast  and straight by balancing 
it on your collarbone as you grip the bottom underhanded.  Concentrate on letting it roll 
out of your wrist. 
5 Are you ready for the big time? Try multiple hoops. Assuming you are right handed, start 
with your dog on your left and throw your first hoop. Just before your dog runs through 
it,  send the next  hoop flying 90 degrees clockwise of the  first.  This will cause your dog to 
approach that hoop from the side, which will be easier for him. Keep throwing hoops in a 
clockwise direction until your dog has made a full circle! Way to shoot those hoops! 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Dogs with a strong prey drive will love this trick. The chase is 
often reward enough that the dog does not need treats to be enthused. QUick-learning dogs

1 A 24"  (61 em) embroidery hoop found at fabric shops offers  a qUick method of securing 
paper within a hoop. Practice a few hoop jumps (page  125) with it  Keep the hoop low to 
the ground, as it is smaller than a regular hoop and harder for your dog to clear. 
2 Attach some tissue paper to the top edge of the hoop, putting a few rips in it so it doesn't 
look like a solid panel. Build your dog's confidence as he goes through. 
3 Secure a sheet of tissue paper all the way across the hoop and tear a big hole  in the 
middle.  Use a treat to coax your dog through the hole.  It may be easier to get him to walk 
through rather than jump.  Praise him excitedly when he tears through the paper.  Have 
him do a few  more jumps  through the hoop with the torn paper  still  hanging from it. 
4Attach a new piece of tissue paper to the hoop. This time, just make a small hole.  Later, 
make just  a slit. 
5 Before you know it, your dog will be comfortable breaking through the paper on his own! 
Use two sheets of tissue paper side by side to get full coverage of the hoop and crumple 
the  edges to keep it tidy. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  This trick is a great confidence builder for dogs.  They are often

Chapter  9 Obstacle  Course 
Life  is full  of obstacles, and the sooner your dog learns to navigate them, the better! 
The obstacles in this chapter require logic skills and are ofen physically and mentally 
challenging.  Some  of them may even be scary for your dog at  first,  making his  trust  in 
you a necessary ingredient for success. Be patient and kind,  encouraging but not 
forceful. Your dog may be hesitant at first, but once he  comes through the other side of 
the  tunnel  (literally), he'll be a more confident dog! 
Dog's tend to dive into obstacles with wilder abandon than their humans.  Make it your 
primary concern to look out for your dog's safety. Maintain regular veterinary checkups 
and inspect your dog's feet, ears,  and coat often.  Check your obstacles for nails, 
splinters, and places where your dog's foot could get stuck. 
Work on a soft ground surface and be sure the obstacles have  a high-traction surface. In 
jumping, your dog should land straight, not twisting,  and largely horzontal. Increase 
dificulty gradually,  as a bad experence may set  progress  back  significantly.  Combine 
several obstacles for a challenging run-through!

Your dog runs through a straight or curved tunnel. The tunnel is one of several obstacles in 
the sport of dog agility. 
1 Allow your dog time to explore a short,  straight tunnel in a familiar area.  Set your dog at 
the opposite end and make eye contact with him through the tunnel.  Coax him toward 
you.  If he attempts to go  around  the tunnel,  have a fend  hold him and gUide him in. 
Reward  him with a treat at the tunnel exit. 
2 Once he is comfortable going through the tunnel, stand at the entrance with him, cue him 
with "tunnel," and gUide him  in.  It often helps to get a running  star.  As he is running 
inside the  tunnel,  run along with him,  encouraging him, so he can hear where you are. 
When he emerges at the other end  keep running alongside him for a short way to 
encourage a speedy exit. 
3 Put a bend in the tunnel.  Your dog may try to make a U-turn inside and come back out the 
entrance,  so keep your eye  on him until you are sure he has committed. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Most dogs enjoy  running through a tunnel and  once accustomed to 
it, will do so every chance they  get!  Confident dogs  can  be running through the  tunnel on 
their first day,  while shy dogs  may require more time.

be a safety cone, plunger, or other unique object preferably one that your dog won't be 
tempted  to take in his  mouth.  Show your dog as you or another person places a treat  on 
the target.  Get your dog's attention as you do  this by  saying  �cookie"  or whichever word 
he understands to mean a treat. 
2 Retur to your dog and point in the direction of the target as you release him with the 
word  "target! "  Allow him to run to the target and eat the treat. 
3 After a few successful iterations,  send your dog to the target without setting a treat on it. 
As soon as your dog touches the target, immediately praise him and give him a treat from 
your hand. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Practice ten iterations per day and within a week you may be able 
to send your dog to a target across the room! 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
IS MY  DOG SUPPOSED TO TOUCH THE TARGET WITH HIS NOSE OR HIS

knows how tojump over a bar  (page  108), and is  assuming  that is what he is supposed 
to do, you'll want to begin this trick by training the under command.  Set your dog on 
one side of the bar and lure him under by holding your treat low to the ground.  Use the 
verbal  cue  often  "under,  good  under! " 
2 Watch his body language and prevent him from jumping over the bar by  blocking his path 
with your hand or by or holding his collar. 
3 Lower the bar so that your dog has to duck down or crawl  to get under.  If your dogjumps 
over the bar, place him back in his original spot,  taking care to lead him around the jump 
rather then letting him jump back over the bar a second time. 
4 Now try with another object such as your outstretched leg. 
0Alternate the  �under"  and  �over"  commands to solidify the difference in your dog's mind.

Teeter-Totter 
TEACH IT: 
VERBAL CUE 
Teeter 
The teeter-totter is an obstacle in the sport of dog agility that is weighted unevenly so that 
one end defaults to the down position.  Your dog runs the length of the plank, balancing 
while it  pivots  midway. 
1 With your  dog watching, place several  treats along the  length of the plank. 
2 Position a friend near the high end of the plank to keep  it from making sudden 
movements. With fingers circling your dog's fat collar, start him at  the low end and let 
him walk to the frst treat. 
3 As he  continues to move forward, there will  be a point at which his weight will  pivot the 
plank.  This is a good  spot to place a treat,  as it  will  slow  him down.  Your friend  should 
gUide the plank sJmvly  and steadily as it pivots.  Reassure him as you keep a firm grasp 
on his collar with his head forward. You don't want your dog to jump off the obstacle, so 
lif him off if he panics. Use lots of praise and encouragement with this new and unstable 
obstacle,  and never use force  as it will heighten an already present fear. 
4 Once  your  dog  gains confidence  on the  teeter-totter,  your fend should allow the plank to 
move  more  freely,  catching it only  right  before  it  hits  the ground, so as to  avoid  a loud 
bang. 
5 Let your dog try  it on his own as you walk alongside him without touching him.  Reward 
him while  he is standing on the very end. 
6 In the sport of dog agility,  and for obvious safety reasons,  dogs should not run so fast  that 
they fly off the end of the  plank before it touches the  ground. Teach your dog to stop at 
the end by  using a  "wait"  command or a target  touch  (page  145). 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Most dogs are a little timid their first time on the teeter-totter, but 
they conquer their fear qUickly with praise and treats!  Don't force the issue-tomorrow is 
another day and your dog may  feel differently about the obstacle then.

WHAT TO EXPECT:  Climbing a ladder requires not only coordination and strength but 
also  confdence.  Take it slowly as a misstep or frightening experience can set your dog 
back. 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
HOW DOES MY DOG GET BACK DOWN? 
Regardless of your dog's athletic ability, you should lift  him to the floor rather 
than letting him jump  down. The potential for injury due to his twisting motion or 
entanglement in the ladder rungs is too  great a risk. 
WHAT TYPE OF LADDER SHOULD  I USE? 
A standard 6'   (1.8 m)  painter' s ladder fits most dogs. 
BUILD  ON IT!  Teach fetch  (page 24)  to have your dog retrieve at item from the top of 
the ladder. 
TIP!  Don't take your eyes off your dog.  Take it one step at  a time, literally. 
STEPS: 
1 Lure your dog to place his front paws on a rung. 
2 Lif his back paw while continuing to lure him upward. 
3 Guard his body while raising the treat.

Roll 
There are several variations of rolling  on a barrel,  including the dog rolling it with his 
front  paws,  his rear paws,  or all four paws.  He can roll it forward  or backward. 
ROLLING WITH FRONT PAWS: 
1 With your dog at your side, steady the barrel and lure your dog upward with a treat. 
Reward him for placing his front paws on the barrel. 
2 Do the same while standing on the opposite side of the barrel. 
3 Now start rolling the barrel. A grass surface is preferable since it prohibits fast motion and 
provides a soft landing.  Place your foot on the barrel with your leg outstretched.  Once 
your dog's front  paws are up on the barrel,  lure his head forward with a treat.  Roll the 
barrel toward you by  pulling with your foot.  Praise and reward your dog for shifting his 
paw backward. 
4As your dog improves,  use your foot to roll the barrel sporadically. Roll it a bit,  and lure 
him forward  until he rolls  it a bit himself. At this pOint, your dog will have to 
comprehend a dificult concept-walking his front  paws backward while his back paws 
walk forward! 
5 If your dog stops rolling the  barrel,  gently tap his paws with your foot to encourage him 
to move them back.  Praise and reward. 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
WHERE DO I GET A BARREL? 
Fifty-five gallon plastic drums are sold at horse feed  stores.  Cover it with a nonslip 
surface such as a rubber mat.  Secure the mat in place  with glue and duct tape along 
the seam, edges.  and circumference. 
TIP!  Increase your dog's motivation by varying the consistency,  amount, and types of 
treats.  Sometimes,  offer a goldfsh  cracker,  sometimes nothing, and  sometimes a 
jackpot of treats! 
STEPS: 
1 Lure his front paws up. 
2 Now try the opposite side. 
3 Roll the barrel toward you, 
luring his head forward, 
and reward. 
ROLLING ON TOP: 
1 With your dog on the opposite side of the barrel, hold it stationary with your foot and lure 
him on top.  Be ready to steady him when he jumps.  Allow him to nibble a treat from 
your hand, keeping your hand  stable,  as he will press against  it  for balance. Try to get 
him  to stay  on top  of the barrel for as long as you  can. 
2 Roll the barrel 6"  (15 em) away you using your foot.  Be prepared with your hand or body 
to block your dog from jumping off. When he  takes  a step  forward,  praise and reward. 
3 Roll the barrel sporadically until your dog is doing it on his own! 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  This is not a trick your dog can lear in a weekend.  It may  take 
twenty sessions  for him to roll the barrel with his front  paws,  and could take  months for  him 
to fnd his balance with all four paws on top.  Certain breeds are better built for this trick­
long-legged  and top-heavy dogs will have the hardest time. 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
MY  DOG JUMPS ON OR OVER THE BARREL 
Use your body to  block the other side of the barrel. 
TIP! This exercise teaches body awareness, which is valuable for any dog. 
STEPS: 
1 Hold the barrel with your foot and lure your dog up. 
Let him nibble a treat while on top. 
2 Roll the barrel away from you.  Be prepared to block your dog from jumping off. 
3 With practice your dog will  be  doing it  on  his own! 
Chapter  10  That  Dog  Can  Dance! 
Active  people have active dogs.  And if you notice your pooch has a paunch, it might 
be time  time for  some exercise  . . .  for the  both of you! 
The sport of canine freestle has  popularzed the tricks in this chapter by chaining them 
together into dance sequences.  Choreographed to music, you and your dog execute 
synchronized spins,  leg kicks, and dance steps.  This is a wonderful way to work as  a 
team with your dog and develop the bond that comes from mutual reliance. 
Eye contact is key to a synchronized performance.  Hold bits of cheese in your mouth 
and spit them to your dog as a reward to  encourage his attention. 
Don't underestimate the importance of your performance!  Little fourishes will 
transform a dull series of behaviors into a lively show!

Heel  Forward and Backward 
TEACH IT: 
VIRBAL CüI
Iee|
A dog at heel walks at the handler's left  side.  In the sport of dog obedience, the dog 
automatically sits when the handler stops.  In the sport of freestyle  (dog dancing)  the heel is 
less rigid,  focusing more  on eye contact and gait. 
HEEL: 
1 With your dog on a loose leash at your left  side, say  �heel" and walk  forward,  stepping 
first with your left foot.  This  step will  later  become your dog's signal to heel.  Always 
give the verbal command first,  before  starting your motion. 
2 Reward your dog periodically for a good efort, remembering to reward at the time when 
your dog is in the correct position-with his shoulder aligned to your left leg. 
3 When preparing to stop, slow your gait,  plant your left  foot.  and bring your right foot up 
to meet  it.  Pull  up on the leash and say  �sit"  (page  15).  
HEEL BACKWARD: 
4With your dog on a short leash at your left, tap his chest with your right foot while cueing 
�back." Reward  him for taking a step back.  As you reward  him,  don't cause him to step 
forward  by offering the treat too far in front of him. Practice heeling backward alongside 
a wall to keep your dog straight. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  In obedience classes, most dogs will be heeling nicely on leash by 
the end of eight weeks.  Heeling is an art form, however, that can always be refned!

Your dog backs up in a straight line away  from you. 
1 Stand in a hallway facing your dog while holding a treat in your closed fist directly in 
front  of his nose.  Press gently on his nose while walking toward him giving the verbal 
cue  �scoot." As your dog takes a few steps  backward,  praise and release the  treat.  If he 
squirms use your foot  opposite the wall to  gUide  that side, or place an  ex-pen to creale a 
narrow chute. 
2 Once your dog is getiing the hang of this, start to decrease dependence on the nose push 
by instead walking in toward your dog while raising your knees  to gently bump his chest. 
Use your hand to signal him backward. 
3 Over time, take smaller steps forward, while continuing to raise your knees to pressure 
your dog backward. Walk over to him to give a reward.  or toss one to him,  rather than 
calling him back to you. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  In a week, your dog could be walking backward following your 
treat. In another few weeks, you may be able to stand stationary while he backs up. 
TROUBLESHOOTING

Your dog spins either a lef or a right full circle. 
SPIN: 
1 Begin with your dog facing you, hiding a treat in your right hand. Move your hand to 
your right, in a large counter-clockwise circle,  slowly luring your dog while telling him 
�spin."  Release the treat at the end of the circle. 
2 As your dog improves,  diminish your hand signal until it is merely a flick of your wrist. 
3 Add some pizzazz-a spin is doubly exciting when you mirror your dog's movement. As 
your dog spins, cross your right foot  in front  of your lef and pivot on your toes until 
you've spun completely around.  (And you thought your dog was going to do all the 
work!) 
4Reach around by using your left  hand to trace a clockwise circle. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Practice ten times per day, and your dog should be following your 
hand  easily within a week.  In a month,  he can be spinning on command! 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
MY  DOG  GOES ONLY HALFWAY 
Reaching your hand too far forward too  early will cause the circle to stall.  Start

MY DOG CIRCLES ONE DIRECTION, BUT NOT THE OTHER 
Analyze your own movements to ensure you are moving symmetrically. 
MY  DOG  FINISHES A CIRCLE, THEN IMMEDIA  TEL Y CIRCLES  THE 
OTHER DIRECTION 
When you finish the hand signal for the first spin,  make sure your hand returns to 
your side.  By leaving it  crossing your body,  you are inadvertently signaling your 
dog to do the next spin. 
BUILD  ON IT!  Teach military turns-while heeling (page  160), cue your dog 
�around" as you turn lef  180 degrees.  Continue heeling in the opposite direction.

1 Warm up with a leg weave  (page  170). 
2 Next, try the leg weave while taking steps that are wider apart but shorter going forward. 
Continue to use the  "weave"  cue. 
3 Transition to taking steps in place.  with your legs wide apart, without making forward 
progress.  Continue to lif each foot to  cue  the dog, and say  "weave. "  Use  an imaginary 
leash to  "pull," or gUide, your dog through your legs from front to back. 
4 Finally, keep your feet  planted but lunge to each side as your dog crosses between your 
legs. As he crosses between your legs in preparation for circling your right  leg,  your rght 
leg should be  bent,  and he should see your right hand gUiding him through your legs and 
toward your rght leg.  Now is the time to change your verbal cue to  "cross." Have him do 
several figure 8' s in a row before treating.  Give him the treat as he is doing the  action, 
rather than after he has stopped.

Chapter  1 1  The  Thi nking Man's Dog 
Intelligence  in  animals has  always been a topic of debate.  but any  dog owner will tell 
you that they've been amazed by their dog's cleverness. As with humans,  a dog's 
brainpower increases with use. The more you challenge your dog to use his 
comprehension,  logic, and reasoning skills,  the qUicker he  will  grasp new concepts. 
The tricks in this chapter have two things in common:  they require a high level of 
thinking on your  dog's part,  and they  are dependent on effective communication from 
you  to your dog.  Your dog  is  being asked  not  simply for a behavior, but a behavior 
based upon a communicated criteria.  He needs to not just retrieve an object,  but retrieve 
a specific one based upon a scent, hand signal, or verbal cue. 
These difficult concepts can be mentally tiring for your dog. Use ten times more praise 
than negative feedback,  as  it is  easy  for your  dog to  become frustrated and discouraged. 
Even after he has learned the concept,  he will  occasionally make mistakes. Give him 
the benefit of the doubt as he  is probably not picking out the wrong scent article or 
retrieving bumper on purpose.  Learning is a lifelong process and these exercises will 
keep your dog mentally  sharp throughout his years!

math problem.  The believability of your dog's genius is dependent upon the  subtlety of 
your signals. Your dog will start barking on cue and continue to bark until he receives 
another cue.  You,  I' m afraid,  need to work out the math! 
1 First, your dog needs to learn to  bark multiple times.  Signal your dog to bark (page 30) 
and continue to signal until you've elicited  two barks. Maintain eye contact with your 
dog as he  barks,  and reward him afer the second bark. 
2 Your dog now needs to learn the signal to stop  barking. This signal will eventually be the 
subtle  aversion of your  eyes.  After your dog's second bark,  lower your signaling hand, 
bow your head, avert your eyes, and say "stop. " Reward your dog qUickly ifhe stopped 
barking. 
3 Increase the number of barks required and decrease dependence on your hand signal.  You 
should be able to give the bark signal once,  and have your dog continue to bark until you 
bow your head and break eye contact. 
4The rest is up to you! You can ask your dog a division problem,  or have him bark once to 
answer  "yes"  and twice for "no." He can tell you his age  (or your age if your audience 
has that  much patience!) 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Dogs are  surprisingly astute at reading our body language. Be 
aware of your movements and consistent in your signals. If you are performing this trick for 
an audience, be aware ihat  dogs in unfamiliar situations may  be hesitant to bark.

Find 
[object name] 
Your dog can lear to identify dozens of objects by name.  Lay them all out on the floor and 
ask your dog to indicate a specifc one. 
1 Start with a fun object whose name  is already familiar to your dog, such as a bumper or 
tennis ball. Lay it in a clear area alongside two other nonenticing objects such as a 
hammer and hairbrush. 
2 Point toward the objects and tell your dog to  �find  [bumper] . " Praise him the  moment he 
grabs  the correct object.  Use  your fetch command  (page  24)  to encourage him to bring  it 
to you.  Reward him with a treat rather than by playing with  the toy.  as the  latter would 
encourage him to only select toys from the pile of objects. 
3 Add a second toy whose name  is known to your dog. Alternate which one you tell him to 
find.  If he chooses incorrectly, don't scold him,  but rather don't acknowledge it one way 
or the  other.  Keep telling him to  �find  [object] . "  
WHAT TO EXPECT:  This fun game  really keeps your dog thinking.  Practice with 
different toys and in different  locations.  Dogs learn the same way we do-by repetition-so

Gel  I! 
HAND  SIGNAL 
Your directional hand signal indicates to your  dog the  course of travel  to fnd an object for 
retrieval.  This exercise, using three white gloves,  is part  of the  Utility Level Obedience test. 
A wagon wheel configuration of bumpers is used to test the abilities of a retrieving dog. 
1 Set three plates about  15'   (4.6 m) around you in a semicircle with o small treat placed on 
only one  of the plates. With your dog sitting at your left and your toes pointed toward the 
plate with the  treat,  indicate to your dog the desired direction  of travel-bend your knees 
slightly,  open your hand.  and run it from behind you straight toward the plate  and 
alongside your dog's head while  telling him  "mark. "  Don't make  eye  contact  with your 
dog,  as you want  him to look ahead to the  plate rather than at you.  Watch his head,  and at 
the  moment he  is looking in the correct direction,  send him with  "get  it!" This is a self­
correcting training method,  as your dog will only  get the treat if he  goes  to the  correct 
plate.  If he  veers in a wrong direction, do not let him finish the exercise, but call him 
back to your side.  If your dog makes the  same  mistake twice in a row, move  a few steps 
closer toward the correct plate. 
2 Now that your dog is reading your mark,  replace the plates with three identical objects, 
such as white gloves or retrieving bumpers. This time your dog will be asked to fetch 
(page  24)  the  object. Remember to point your  toes  in the  correct direction and send  your 
dog only when his gaze  is correctly directed. 
3 Try a four-bumper wagon-wheel configuration-after a successful retrieve, toss the 
bumper back to  its  spot  and select a new direction for the next  retrieve. Try this 
configuration with eight or sixteen bumpers, or try  a staggered configuration with 
bumpers at varying  distances.  Most difficult of all is a blind retrieve, where the  bumpers 
are  hidden in tall grass or behind  a bush. 
WHAT TO EXPECT: Sporting dogs generally have an easier time holding their mark 
(direction), while herding and toy  breeds can have  a harder time.  The skill behind this 
exercise  is your  dog's ability to set out  in a straight  course  in a designated direction.  Once 
learned, this  skill  can have  a variety of uses.

Find the Object with My Scent 
TEACH IT: 
VERBAL CUE 
Find mine 
Utility Obedience competition requires your dog to search twelve identical objects and 
retrieve the one  with your scent.  Leather and  metal  dumbbells are  commonly used for this 
exercise,  but wooden dowels,  metal jar lids, or even  clean silverware can be used. 
1 It is vital to this exercise that the  articles used are  free  of your scent. Air them out for 
several days between uses and  handle them using tongs.  Mark them with  unique numbers 
so you can tell which is the scented one! 
2 Using pegboard or a mat with holes poked through, tie down two out of three identical 
articles.  Scent the third  by rubbing it in your palms for ten seconds,  and also with a little 
of the  treat you are using.  Place the scented article with the other two, and instruct your 
dog to fetch  (page 24).  Be very gentle when training scent  work.  Avoid saying  "no," but 
instead let your dog figure out on his own that only one article is retrievable and not tied 
down.  Praise him the second he takes the correct article in his mouth, and reward him for 
bringing it  to you. 
3 Tie additional unscented articles to the mat.  If your dog has trouble finding  the free one, 
encourage him to keep looking.  Phase out the scent of the  treat, and use only your scent 
on the  object. 
4 Now try it with all the  objects not tied down.  If your dog picks up o wrong one, just 
ignore it as he may change his mind on his own.  If he starts to bring an incorrect article 
back to you, use an encouraging tone to tell him to keep looking.  Do not accept the 
wrong item. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  Scent work is one of the most difficult exercises to train, and dogs 
can be particularly sensitive to  criticism in this area.  If your dog feels he has been 
reprmanded for choosing an incorrect article, he may doubt his understanding of your 
wishes and use an avoidance technique to get out of doing the exercise.

Similar to a drug-detection dog, your K-9 will sniff out contraband.  Three volunteers 
participate, one of whom is given a tea bag. Your dog searches for the  "contraband"  tea bag 
scent,  and indicates the  possessor.  Train your dog to indicate the find with a signal such  as 
sitting, lying down,  or nuzzling the tea bag. 
1 Build on your dog's knowledge of finding hidden treats  (page 98), by  transitioning to 
finding a tea bag.  Hold the tea bag to your dog's nose, and use the word  "scent"  to 
indicate this is the scent to seek. 
2 Hide the tea bag in an obvious spot, and place a treat on top of it. Instruct your dog to 
�find it" and let him eat the treat when he does. 
3 After several repetitions, rub the treat on the tea bag, and hide the tea bag only. Encourage 
your dog as he searches, even pointing and running alongside him. He will probably 
come close to the tea bag,  but not know what to  do.  At this pOint,  place a treat on top of 
the  tea bag,  and praise him when he  gets  it.  This transition period will be a little 
confusing, as your dog learns that he is searching for the tea bag,  and  not the treat. 
Eventually, you will hide the tea bag only, and when your dog finds it you can toss him a 
treat. 
4 Once your dog has the  hang of searching out the tea bag in hidden spots,  try placing in on 
a person's knee, as they sit on the foor. 
0 Now try the real thing;  three people sitting in chairs, one of whom is hiding a tea bag. 
Leave enough room between them for your dog to search from the sides.  Hold a 
duplicate tea bag to your dog's nose and tell him "scent."  Send him  on his search with 
�find it!" At frst,  help your dog by gUiding him to search each person,  as he may think 
the  tea bag is somewhere else in the  house.  When he indicates that he has found the tea 
bag,  praise and reward!

Your dog has an extraordinary nose  and can track the  path  traveled by you or another 
person. 
1 Lay your track in moist  grass, where the scent will be easiest to detect.  Scuff your feet at 
the beginning of your track to create a �scent pad,"  and continue scufing as you walk 
about  50 yards  (46 m)  in a straight line. Drop odoriferous treats, such as hot dog slices, 
along your path every few yards and use small cones or flags to remind yourself of your 
path. Leave an object with your scent, such as a sock, at the end of the track.  Stuff some 
treats inside the sock to capture your dog's interest. 
2 Outfit your dog in a harnesses and  12'   (3.7 m) lead and brng him to the scent pad. Tell 
him to  �track"  and  let him find the frst treat left along your trail.  Unlike in obedience. 
when tracking your dog leads-showing you where to go. Walk slowly. allowing him to 
pull forward.  Do not reprmand him for veering off track, but do not let him pull you off 
course. 
3 When a working tracking dog finds a scented object,  he is trained to signal the handler by 
lying down. When your dog gets to the end of your track and nuzzles the sock, tell him to 
lie down (page  16)  and reward him with a treat from inside. 
4 Now try a gradual gO-degree turn in your track. Note that your track holds its scent for a 
day  or more, so use a variety of training locations. Take note of the wind direction. If 
your dog is traveling downwind from your track,  it may be that he is airscenting. 
Graduate to a 20'  (6. 1 m)  lead and farther spaced treats as your dog becomes more 
independent.  Increase difficulty by aging the tracks before following them. 
WHAT TO EXPECT: It is often hard to distinguish between a dog off-track and a dog 
picking up scent that has blown downwind. Have trust that your dog knows his job and 
assume your role as coach rather than teacher.  Dogs enjoy scent work and can be  tracking a

VERBAL  CUE 
He3c do 
HAND  Î1ÖNL
f
From a down position, your dog lowers his head to rest upon the floor. This is a common 
trck for movie dogs.  �Aw, the doggy looks sad! "  
1 Kneel to the side of your dog as he  rests in a down position.  Hold a treat on the  floor, out 
ofreach in front of him.  Cue "head down" while using your other hand to gently push his 
head to the floor using pressure pOints behind his ears. 
2 Hold him for a few seconds with his chin resting on the foor between his paws,  then 
praise and slide your treat toward him.  Allow him to take the treat and then give your 
release word  "OK" and release his head so he can chew. If your dog is very  resistant to 
your physical manipulation, reward the instant his chin touches the foor,  so as not to 
cause him to struggle. 
3 Gradually lighten your touch on his head,  so that you do short taps rather than constant 
pressure.  Once his head is down, instruct him to  "stay"  a few  seconds before rewarding. 
Always present your reward on the floor,  so your dog isn't tempted to look up for it. 
WHAT TO EXPECT: In its final stage, you should be able to stand some  distance from 
your dog and point  on the  ground while giving  the  verbal cue.  Submissive dogs will have 
an easier time with this behavior than dominant dogs.  Train calmly and  gently,  and gauge 
your dog's anxiety level  so as not to push him past his comfort  zone. 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
MY  DOG RUNS AWAY WHEN I TRY TO TRAIN THIS TRICK 
Physically manipulating your dog is a slippery slope.  He may think you are 
dominating him or punishing him by pushing his head down.  Progress slowly and 
gently with this trick,  and only practice two or three times per session.  Praise 
lavishly! 
BUILD  ON IT! Lift your pOinted finger up from  the floor to teach �head up." 
TIP! Old dogs want to  make you proud as well! Ask them for a behavior they can 
achieve, and praise lavishly! 
1 A combination of a food lure  and your hand  pressure will gUide your dog's head down. 
\ 
2 Slide the treat to your dog while keeping him in the  proper position. 
3 Use your hand signal to focus your dog's attention downward.

Cover Your Eyes

HANP  SIGNAL 
Your dog hides his eyes by hooking his paw over his muzzle. 
1 Stick a sticky note or piece of tape to your  dog's muzzle and encourage him to  �cover, get 
it!" One swipe at his face  should be enough to dislodge the paper. Praise him with "good 
cover! " 
2 With your dog laying down, stick the note to the center of his head. just above his eyes. 
He will have  a harder time swatting at this spot and will eventually poke his head under 
one wrist.  Perfect!  Be  ready to  reward him in the spot  where  his head  pokes  under his 
paw. 
3 Alternate between using the sticky note and just tapping his head in the spot where you 
normally stick the sticky note.  Use  "stay"  to get your dog to hold the position for a few 
seconds. 
4Try  it from a sitting position. Place the sticky note on the bridge of your dog's nose  and 
when he raises  his paw to swat at it,  reward him under his arm.  As you wean off the 
sticky note,  he may try to get away with  merely waving, without touching his face.  In 
this case, go back to using a sticky note.  Eventually, stand up while  giving the  cue  to 
encourage your dog's head higher.  Try it with your dog in different  positions:  sit,  down, 
or bow. 
WHAT TO EXPECT: This method of training is so natural that your dog should be 
sWiping the note right away. After about a month,  or 200 repetitions, your dog should have 
the  hang  of an eye  cover with the  aid  of the  sticky note.  It could take a lot longer,  however, 
until he  has it mastered without that aid. 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
MY  DOG SHAKES HIS HEAD INSTEAD  OF PAWING AT THE STICKY 
NOTE 
Use a stronger adhesive tape so your dog can't merely shake it off.  Cue him to 
shake hands  (page  22)  to give him the idea to use his paw.  Stick the note in 
different places:  above or below his eye  or on top of his head. 
MY  DOG JUST SITS THERE WITH THE PAPER STUCK TO HIS NOSE! 
Your dignified dog needs to be encouraged to attack the  object,  as he would a bug 
on his nose. Touch the paper to make him aware of it and use your voice to excite 
him. 
TIP! Take your dog on a trip or errand. It will be good for his social skills and he'll 
enjoy the  change of scenery. 
STEPS: 
1 Encourage your dog to swipe at a stcky  note on his face. 
2 While  laying down, your dog will Jke  his head under his paw. 
3 Just tap the  spot on his head instead of using a sticky note. 
4 Go back to using the sticky note, but this time in the  sitting position. 
Stand up to encourage your dog's head higher. 
Try  an eye  cover in a bow position.

HANP  SIGNAL 
Your dog waves his paw high in the air. 
1 With your dog sitting, face  him and have  him shake hands (page 22). 
2 Say  "shake, bye-bye"  and extend your hand a little higher than you normally would to 
shake hands.  Your dog won't be able to hold his paw that high, so his motion will look 
like he is pawing at your hand. 
3 Draw your hand slightly away from your dog, so he can just barely reach your fngers. 
4 Pull your hand back at the  last second so he is not  touching  it at  all,  but merely pawing 
the  air.  Be sure to praise him, so he understands that the  desired  behavior is the waving 
motion,  as opposed to  the  actual touch. 
WHAT TO EXPECT:  With a solid shake. your dog can transition to a wave within a few 
training sessions. 
PREREQUISITES 
Shake hands  (page 22) 
TROUBLESHOOTING 
AS I MOVE AWAY FROM MY DOG, HE KEEPS MOVING TOWARD ME, 
TRYING TO TOUCH MY HAND 
Stand a few feet away from your dog with your hand outstretched toward him as 
you cue him. At the last second, pull your hand away so that he is pawing the air. 
Reward this! 
MY  DOG STANDS UP 
Put him back in a sit before continuing to train.  He will have higher extension 
from a sitting position. 
BUILD  ON IT!  Sit alongside your dog as you both wave good-bye together. 
TIP! Sometimes, your dog offers an unexpected, but cute, behavior.  Don't miss that 
opportunity!  Reward  it and try  to elicit it again. 
STEPS: 
"Bye, bye!" 
1 Have your dog shake hands. 
2 Extend your hand higher than normal. 
3 With your hand farther away. your dog can just barely reach your fingers. 
4 Pull your hand back at the last second so your dog paws the  air. 
Transition to the hand signal. 
"Bye, bye!"

ABOUT  THE  PHOTOGRAPHER 
Born in Baltimore, Maryland.  Nick Saglimbeni moved to Los Angeles in  1997 to pursue 
cinematography at  the top-ranked  USC  School of Cinema. After shooting several 
commercials,  music videos,  and short films, Nick was recognized in 2003  by  the American 
Society of Cinema-tographers with a Heritage Award. That same year, after hearing 
countless  stories from frustrated actors and models who were  unable to find good 
photographers,  Nick  opened SlickforceStudio, a cutting-edge photo  studio  in downtown 
LA.  Clients immediately responded to the cinematic nature of Nick's work,  and the studio 
qUickly gained international recognition.  Nick's work has been featured in many  major 
magazines, and he continues to shoot for film and television. You can see more  of his work 
at www.slickforce.com.

extremely intelligent dog with a kind and gentle soul.  She will be missed by all those who 
knew and  loved  her, and  especially by her owner,  Claire.

This page was supposed to be called the  "conclusion." But this is not the conclusion  to your 
dog training at all,  but rather the first steps in a lifelong endeavor.  Now that you have some 
skills under your  belt  and ideas and gUidance for training, your  adventure is just  beginning! 
As you've read through the tricks in this book, you've probably noticed similarities in 
training techniques-give a cue, lure your dog into position, give the reward, up the ante. 
As you get ready to train new tricks, original tricks,  tricks that are unique to you and your 
dog, use the strategies you've learned to figure  out the methods. 
Test your training creativity by running down the list  to the left, and thinking about how 
you would  train these tricks. How would you get your dog to lick his lips  (number  17  in the 
list)? Why, you put peanut butter on his nose, of course!  How about io use a soft  mouth to 
carry an egg  (number  38)? Train with a stick wrapped in wire, which would hurt his teeth if 
he  bared down.  Cross your paws  (number 6)? Have your dog do a paw shake while in a 
down position.  Gradually move your hand to the side, until his shake  crosses over his other 
paw.  Sing  (number  35)? When does your dog normally howl? At a siren or other noise? 
Most dogs will sing to a harmonica if you hit the right note.  I'm sure you get the idea. 
Our dog's lives are far too short,  and the time we have to enjoy with them passes qUickly. 
Make the most of it!

1.	 Introduction
1.1	 Why Open a Pet Hotel?
Are you an energetic and caring “pet person”? When you visit friends or family, are their pets drawn to you when they sense your love for all creatures great and small? Perhaps you already share your home with a few animals, or have one special someone in your life — a noble, beautiful purebred, a four-legged bundle of fur and kisses, or maybe a silky, purring lap companion. If you love pets and interacting with them, and are looking for a fun and profitable way to make a career out of working with animals, becoming a pet hotel owner is fabulous way to make your dreams a reality.

1.1.1	 What Pet Hotels Are All About
Pet hotels are facilities that provide day and overnight care for dogs, cats and other pets while their owners are away from home. Typical cage kenneling may be offered by a local vet or groomer, but today’s discerning pet owners are usually looking for something better for their precious pet. Enter the pet hotel, a concept quickly gaining in popularity across North America. In the past, pet owners going away on vacation who had no one to check in on their pets at home had to bring them to a kennel where cages were small and cramped, nervous cats had to sit right next to big barking dogs, and human interaction ended for the night when the staff went home. But what used to be known simply as kennels have come a long way in recent years. Today’s pet hotels offer pets and their owners a completely different experience, with the chance to enjoy their “vacation” while the owners enjoy theirs. A pet hotel strives to create an environment for the pet that is as much like its home as possible. Instead of a cage or crate, pet hotel guests typically enjoy a private suite that offers play space, a bed, and a place to eat. In pet hotels, cats rest in spacious “kitty condos,” which feature places to climb to, a bed, toys, and ideally even some sunbeams to lounge in. Dogs enjoy large private runs or suites, as well as daily social time in a play group with other dogs. For these luxury services, the pet hotel rates are usually higher than a typical boarding kennel would charge, but most owners would agree the cost is worth the peace of mind. The hotel itself can range from a big room full of suites for animals of all kinds, to a “stay-away camp” or “pet resort” on a few acres of land, which offers daily activities and group play. Pet hotel owners typically spend their day:
•	Checking guests in and out of the hotel •	Supervising and scheduling staff •	Visiting, checking in on, and entertaining your pet guests

•	Taking reservations and assigning suites •	Helping staff with feeding and nap/bedtime routines •	Supervising groups of dogs playing together •	Taking dogs for a walk or to a nearby green space •	Keeping up with trends in the industry •	Marketing your pet hotel to new and existing clients

PetSmart, the pet supply and pet store chain, has made the concept of luxury pet boarding widely available under their trade name of PetsHotel, which you can check out at the link below. But rest assured that there is still plenty of room on the market for independently run pet hotels and resorts. •	PetSmart PetsHotel http://petshotel.petsmart.com/index.shtml Linda Zago, whose pet hotel, Muzo, opened in July of 2007, suggests that the traditional model of kennelling has seen its day. “A common misconception is that kennels are prisons, and that they are all the same. The biggest mistake I see others in this business make is not wanting to change the traditional way of conducting operations. People are becoming more and more emotionally involved with their pets, making them very demanding.” TIP:	 Pet hotels combine very well with dog daycares if you want to make full use of your space day and night. This book will provide guidelines for starting a pet hotel, but be aware that you can start a business that offers both these services under one roof. Section 2.3.1 has information about adding dog daycare services to your pet hotel.

1.1.2	 A Booming Industry
Lots of people share their lives with pets, and where there are pets, there is a need for pet hotels. According to the 2007-2008 National Pet Owners Survey, 63% of U.S. households own a pet, up from 56% 20 years ago. So in addition to revealing that 71.1 million homes in the

U.S. have pets in them, the survey also shows that pet ownership is on the rise. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics offers encouraging predictions for people who want to open pet hotels. They’ve identified animal care as a growth industry — in fact, they expect it to grow faster than the national average for all occupations through 2014. The BLS says:
“Pet owners — including a large number of baby boomers, whose disposable income is expected to increase as they age — are expected to increasingly take advantage of daily and overnight boarding services. As many pet owners increasingly consider their pet as part of the family, their demand for luxury animal services and willingness to spend greater amounts of money on their pet will continue to grow.”

In addition to more people owning pets, it turns out we’re also spending more on them annually too. The American Pet Products Manufacturers Association estimated Americans’ annual spending on their pets at $40.8 billion as of 2007. This impressive figure has more than doubled since 1994, when annual spending was estimated at $17 billion. “I opened the first Dogtopia in 2002, and the growth has been stellar. We definitely found a niche in people who love their dogs and want the best for them,” explains founder Amy Nichols, whose pet business offers overnight as well as daytime care for dogs. “The growth in the pet industry is unprecedented — I am still amazed by what people will spend on their pets! I truly feel that the sky is the limit, and we are only going to continue to see more growth in the coming years,” Nichols predicts. “Business has been better than I ever dreamed when we opened,” confirms Bobbi Heimbaugh, owner of Paws Inn, a 5000-square-foot pet hotel in Iowa. “I knew when I was writing my business plan that there was a great need for it, but I had no idea how great that need actually was. We just celebrated our one-year anniversary, and now have over 600 doggy clients.”

1.1.3	 Benefits of the Career
There are many great reasons why becoming a pet hotel owner is a dream career. Here’s an overview of the benefits you’ll enjoy in the dayand-night pet care industry.

Work with Animals
The obvious reward of working with beautiful and lovable animals has to come first on this list. Pets are fun, entertaining, and interesting creatures to work with. While many animal lovers are drawn to veterinary work, not all can continue when they realize how sad it can be to work with sick or injured animals all day. It’s not that the work of a vet or vet tech isn’t wonderful and needed, but it’s not for everyone, particularly those who are very emotional or sensitive. Opening a pet hotel is an alternative career path that still offers daily interaction with people and their pets, in an environment that you create and control.

Be Your Own Boss
When you start your pet hotel, you’ll determine your own hours, and set your own policies. You’ll also decide when you’re going to take those well-deserved days off. “I was in telecommunications prior to my venture into entrepreneurship,” explains Dogtopia’s Amy Nichols. “I enjoyed the challenge, but ultimately when I got where I was looking to go, the grass was not all that green. It was lucrative but not very fulfilling. I wanted to be able to be more dynamic and have more decisionmaking abilities. Starting your own business gives you all that and then some — often too many decisions!” she says with a smile.

Be Truly Appreciated
No more working for someone who doesn’t value or reward you for your many talents. More than once in this career you’ll hear clients tell you that they appreciate the services you offer. You will be trusted and appreciated by the pets you care for, and you will see firsthand the difference you make in their lives. Pet “parents” will be loyal and grateful when they find a pet hotel like yours.

  O  termo  cirurgia  tem  sido  definido  de  várias  maneiras,  porém  do  ponto  de  vista  da 
cirurgia  moderna,  uma  definição  simples  é  difícil.  Consiste  em  uma  disciplina  separada  da 
medicina, porém não pode ser isolada dessa e das ciências básicas, como a anatomia, fisiologia, 
microbiologia e patologia. 
  Entende-se  por  cirurgia  ao  uso  de  interferência  manipulatória  para  o  diagnóstico 
específico no tratamento de doenças, modificar a função fisiológica ou estrutura anatômica e para 
um propósito específico. 
2 2. . O OB BJ JE ET TI IV VO O 
1.  aumentar  o  valor  econômico  dos  pacientes,  através  de  cirurgias  como  a  castração  e  o 
descorne; 
2.  valorizar  os  animais  de  estimação,  por  meio  de  operações  como  onicectomia, 
ovariohisterectomia e orquiectomia; 
3.  diagnóstico  de  doenças  através  de  cirurgias  exploratórias  para  visualização  direta  de  um 
processo patológico ou da introdução de catéteres ou agulhas para coleta de amostras, injeção 
de  contrastes  e  drogas,  ou  para  medida  direta  de  parâmetros  fisiológicos  como  a  pressão 
sangüínea; 
4.  tratamento de doenças como a reparação de ossos fraturados (aplicação direta da cirurgia) ou 
como  numa  neurectomia  digital  posterior  no  eqüino,  para  aliviar  a  dor  secundária  a  um 
processo patológico (aplicação indireta da cirurgia); 
5.  corrigir  através  de  cirurgia  cosmética  ou  plástica  -  nem  sempre  necessária  e  não  obrigatória 
em alguns países, como o corte de orelha e amputação de cauda;

  A finalidade da cirurgia humana é salvar a vida dos pacientes, mesmo com mutilações. 
  A  finalidade  da  cirurgia  veterinária  nos  pequenos  animais  é  a  mesma,  pois  existe  o 
envolvimento afetivo. Nos grandes animais existem limitações de ordem econômica, sendo que o 
principal objetivo passa a ser a qualidade de produção e trabalho. 
  Existem outros fatores limitantes em medicina veterinária, como a pouca longevidade dos 
animais, os recursos diagnósticos e as criações extensivas.

  O período pré-operatório envolve desde as manobras gerais, como a preparação do local 
da  cirurgia,  esterilização  dos  instrumentos,  coleta  de  material  para  exames  laboratoriais,  banho 
do  paciente,  jejum,  preparação  do  campo  operatório,  aplicação  de  soro,  antibiótico  profilático, 
contenção do paciente, pré-anestesia, tricotomia, posicionamento na mesa e anti-sepsia. 
  O  período  trans-operatório  compreende  manobras  como  a  diérese,  hemostasia, 
procedimentos especiais e síntese. 
  O período pós-operatório, que passa pela remoção das suturas, inclui a limpeza da ferida, 
colocação  de  bandagens,  administração  de  medicamentos  e  procedimentos  de  monitoração 
sistêmica,  no  mínimo  diário.  O  período  do  pós-operatório  imediato  vai  até  a  recuperação  do

  Baseada no conceito histológico em que os tecidos vivos são formados por células unidas 
por tecido elástico fino e com fibrilas nervosas, capilares, vasos linfáticos e sangüíneos. 
  O  rompimento  destas  células  pelo  trauma  cirúrgico  propicia  a  liberação  de  enzimas  que 
retardam a cicatrização. Por este motivo deve-se minimizar o traumatismo cirúrgico. 
  A prevenção do trauma faz-se através de um bom planejamento da cirurgia, trabalho em 
conjunto, boa iluminação, controle da força, conhecimento da anatomia topográfica, controle dos 
movimentos  e  gestos,  busca  de  um  ponto  de  apoio  para  diminuir  o  tremor  e  da  diminuição  do 
tempo de cirurgia. 
  As regras básicas que norteiam a doutrina da técnica cirúrgica atraumática são: 
  cirurgião sem tensão; 
  movimentos mínimos e precisos; 
  dissecar somente o indispensável; 
  reduzir a exposição de tecidos ao mínimo; 
  manipulação suave; 
  uso de instrumentos e técnicas corretas; 
  uso de compressas embebidas em solução fisiológica morna.

  Dois fatores interrelacionados - trauma e infeção - são responsáveis pelo sucesso ou falha 
das  cirurgias.  Praticamente  o  objetivo  de  todas  as  intervenções,  seja  direta  ou  indiretamente  é 
limitar o trauma e diminuir o risco de infeção cirúrgica. 
  As grandes possibilidades da cirurgia moderna têm se desenvolvido paralelamente com o 
grande aumento das responsabilidades do cirurgião. Ele é o principal responsável pelo bem estar 
e saúde do paciente antes, durante e após a cirurgia. 
  Os  dois  maiores  fatores  que  contribuíram  para  o  desenvolvimento  da  cirurgia  moderna 
foram o descobrimento da anestesia e a aplicação dos princípios da anti-sepsia e da assepsia. 
2 2. . H HI IS ST TÓ ÓR RI IC CO O 
  Alguns grandes cientistas contribuíram para que isso acontecesse: 
 Louis Pasteur (1822 - 1895), com a descoberta do microscópio, pode estudar e 
identificar bactérias responsáveis pela putrefação, carbúnculo e raiva nos animais, 
proporcionando os fundamentos das técnicas da anti-sepsia. 
 Joseph  Lister  (1827  -  1912),  cirurgião  inglês,  descobriu  que  o  pus  não  se 
formava  em  feridas  cuja  contaminação  era  evitada.  Usou  ácido  carbólico  para 
lavar as feridas e evitar a contaminação, dando início à doutrina da anti-sepsia. 
 Ignácio  P.  Sammelweis  (1818  -  1865),  obstetra  austríaco,  reconheceu  a 
importância  da  lavagem  das  mãos  antes  das  manobras  obstétricas  como  método 
para diminuir a incidência da febre puerperal. 
 Oliver  Holmes  (1809  -  1894),  advogou  a  mudança  das  roupas  e  lavagem  das 
mãos após sair das salas de necropsia. 
 Ernest  Von  Bergmann  (1836  -  1907),  usou  cloreto  de  mercúrio  ao  invés  do 
ácido carbólico para anti-sepsia e em 1886 introduziu a esterilização a vapor. Este

método  foi  estudado  por  Merke  (1880)  em  Berlin  e  aperfeiçoado  por  Koch  em 
1881. 
 Robert Koch (1843 - 1910), bacteriologista alemão, demonstrou pela primeira 
vez  a  especificidade  de  diferentes  tipos  de  bactérias  para  produzir  infeções 
cirúrgicas. 
 William S. Halsted (1852  - 1922), entre outras técnicas cirúrgicas, introduziu 
o uso das luvas de borracha para praticar cirurgias. As primeiras luvas de borracha 
foram  feitas  pela  Goodyear  e  usadas  em  1891  para  prevenir  dermatite  em  uma

  Para  melhor  entendimento  dessa  doutrina,  torna-se  necessário  conceituar  os  seguintes 
termos: 
3.1 - Esterilização 
É  a  destruição  de  todos  os  germes,  patogênicos  ou  não.  Refere-se  a  objetos 
inanimados, como roupas, instrumentos, etc... 
3.2 - Desinfecção 
É a destruição de quase todos os germes patogênicos e não patogênicos e refere-se 
a objetos inanimados como instalação, pisos, blocos cirúrgicos, etc... 
3.3 - Anti-sepsia 
  É  a  manobra  que  impede  a  proliferação  de quase todos os microorganismos, seja 
inativando-as  (bacteriostáticos)  ou  destruindo-as  (bactericidas).  Refere-se  a 
procedimentos em tecidos vivos, como mucosa e pele do animal. 
3.4 - Assepsia 
É o conjunto de procedimentos que se empregam para evitar infecção dos tecidos 
durante as intervenções cirúrgicas, em locais não contaminados. 
É  um  termo  amplo  que  engloba  manobras  de  esterilização,  desinfecção  e  anti-
sepsia.

  A esterilização pode ser feita por métodos físicos e métodos químicos.

  Nos métodos químicos incluem-se os desinfetantes de 1
o
, 2
0
 e 3

 graus na forma líquida e 
gasosa. 
4.1 - Métodos físicos 
4.1.1   - Filtração: é a separação de material em partículas de líquidos ou gases e 
feita  através  de  filtros.  Nos  filtros  são  removidos  os  microorganismos  e 
outras  partículas  do  material  filtrado,  pois  as  partículas  maiores  ficam 
retidas  na  superfície  do  filtro.  Existem  filtros  de  membrana  e  de 
profundidade, com uma espessura de aproximadamente 150 . 
4.1.2   -  Radiação:  é  usada  naqueles  materiais  que  não  podem  ser  esterilizados 
pelo calor ou por íons químicos.  
TÉCNICA CIRÚRGICA                                                                                      Ney Pippi

Existem dois tipos de radiações aplicáveis, a eletromagnética e a de 
partículas.  Ambas  produzem  efeitos  líticos  pela  produção  de  ionização 
dentro  ou  próximo  ao  organismo.  Geralmente  é  chamada  de  esterilização 
fria, pois não ocorre elevação de temperatura. 
    4.1.3 - Energia Térmica: 
      a) Calor Seco: flambagem, forno de Pasteur e incineração. 
Flambagem:  pode  ser  usada  em  emergências  e  não  produz  uma 
esterilização eficiente, além de encurtar a vida útil do instrumental. 
Forno  de  Pasteur:  promove  uma  esterilização  boa,  sendo 
demorada  e  pode  ser  usada  a  180
0
C  por  30  minutos  ou  200
0
C  por  20 
minutos.  O  forno  deve  ser  aberto  quando  a  temperatura  estiver  inferior  a 
40
0
C. 
I ncineração: é um método efetivo de esterilização pelo calor seco, 
porém  é  altamente  destrutivo,  sendo  usado  mais  para  exterminação  de 
material contaminado e de carcaças. 
 
b) Calor Úmido: água em ebulição e autoclave 
Água  em  Ebulição:  em  condições  normais  não  deve  ser 
considerado um agente esterilizador e sim desinfetante. O tempo requerido 
para  esterilização  é  de  30  minutos  em  nível  do  mar.  Este  tempo  pode  ser 
reduzido  em  50%  pela  adição  de  hidróxido  de  sódio  (0,1g/100  ml)  ou 
carbonato de sódio (2g/10ml). 
Autoclave: baseia-se no princípio de que o vapor retido sob pressão 
alcança altas temperaturas sem entrar em ebulição (mecanismos da panela 
de  pressão).  Funciona  a  135
o
C  por  3  minutos,  125
o
C  por  10  minutos  ou 
120
o
 por 15 minutos. 
 
O material deve ser muito limpo e exposto ao vapor para assegurar um bom aquecimento. 
O  instrumental  deve  ser  enrolado  em  material  permeável  ao  calor  e  a  autoclave  deve  ser 
apropriadamente  manuseada.  Dentre  as  vantagens  tem-se  o  ciclo  rápido,  permitindo  vários 
processamentos por dia, menor dano ao instrumental e a menor exposição ao calor. A autoclave a 
vácuo funciona como a de vapor. 
4.2- Métodos químicos 
  O  termo  esterilização  química  implica  no  uso  de  líquidos  ou  gases  para  se  obter  a 
esterilização.  O  efeito  deste  tipo  de  esterilização  sobre  os  microorganismos  é  através  de 
mudanças na estrutura química na célula. Muitos desinfetantes podem esterilizar quando usados 
em condições apropriadas, mas poucos têm a qualificação de serem confiáveis. Dentre os agentes 
que promovem a esterilização gasosa tem-se o formaldeído e o óxido de etileno. 
  As  indicações  para  seu  uso  são  as  fumigações  de  grandes  espaços,  como  ambientes 
hospitalares  ou  barracas  e  a  esterilização  de  materiais  sensíveis  ao  calor  e  que  não  suportam 
muita umidade, como plásticos, instrumentos ópticos e borrachas. 
4.2.1.  Desinfetantes  de  l
o
  grau:  capazes  de  esterilização  são  o 
formaldeído,  glutaraldeído,  iodo  e  o  óxido  de  etileno,  cujo  mecanismo  de 
esterilização  é  o  de  alquilação  (átomos  de  hidrogênio  são  repostos  por  grupos  de 
hidróxido  etílico  bloqueando  assim  os  grupos  reativos  para  que  se  realizem  as 
reações metabólicas). O formaldeído (CH

O) é um sólido branco que sublima em 
temperatura ambiente. Em fumigações de salas ou outros espaços 0,5 a 1,0 ml de

formalina  por  30  cm³  de  espaço  a  ser  vaporizado.  A  temperatura  ambiente  deve 
ser ao redor de 20°C e a umidade relativa do ar de 100%. 
    As bactérias vegetativas são mortas em 2 horas. Os esporos necessitam 12 
horas  para  serem  mortos.  Após  a  esterilização  com  formaldeído,  a  aeração  é 
necessária. Os gases são muito irritantes e a alta umidade requerida é corrosiva. 
    O  óxido  de  etileno  é  o  agente  gasoso  mais  popular  para  esterilização 
existe,  por  ter  uma  dissipação  mais  rápida  que  o  formaldeído  sendo,  porém  mais 
inflamável  e  explosivo.  Difunde-se  e  penetra  rapidamente  no  material  a  ser 
esterilizado,  sendo  por  isto  indicado  para  esterilizar  objetos  longos  e  tubulares. 
Possui  propriedade  bactericida  em  todos  microorganismos  e  sal  ação  é  por 
alquilação.  Existem  equipamentos  disponíveis  para  este  tipo  de  esterilização, 
como a autoclave e outros portáteis (cilindro que pode ser lacrado). 
    4.2.2.  Desinfetantes  de  2
o
  grau:  desinfetantes  que  atuam  pela 
desnaturação das proteínas. São os compostos fenólicos, clorinas, álcool e iodo. 
    4.2.3. Desinfetantes de 3
o
 grau: desinfetantes que não têm poder virucida, 
esporocida  e  tuberculocida,  incluem  os  compostos  mercuriais  e  compostos  de 
amônio quaternário, cuja ação é mais bacteriostática.  
4.3 - Graus de desinfecção química 
    4.3.1.  Primeiro  grau  (alto):  usado  para  esterilizar  itens  críticos,  ou  seja, 
todo  material  usado  em  intervenções  cirúrgicas.  Os  desinfetantes  desta  categoria 
devem  ter  capacidade  de  destruir  formas  vegetativas,  esporos,  bacilo  da 
tuberculose e vírus. 
    4.3.2. Segundo grau (intermediário): destroem vírus e todas as bactérias, 
exceto  esporos.  Itens  semi-críticos,  usados  em  contato  com  mucosas,  devem  ser 
desinfetados  por  estes  agentes.  A  atividade  tuberculocida  e  virucida  é  requerida 
nos agentes desta categoria. 
    4.3.3.  Terceiro  grau  (baixo):  usado  em  itens  não  críticos,  como 
bebedouros,  e  outros  recipientes.  Os  desinfetantes  desta  categoria  possuem  a 
propriedade  de  destruir  formas  vegetativas  de  bactérias,  porém  não  possuem 
atividade virucida ou tuberculocida. 
5 5. . A AN NT TI I- -S SÉ ÉP PT TI IC CO OS S 
  Muitos  dos  desinfetantes  que  são  usados  em  objetos  inanimados  são  também  usados  na 
pele e em feridas. Quando são usadas com este propósito são chamados de anti-sépticos. Eles são 
usados para reduzir a flora bacteriana da pele dos braços e mãos da equipe cirúrgica e o campo 
operatório  do  paciente.  Este  é  o  ponto  fraco  da  técnica  cirúrgica  asséptica,  pois  é  impossível 
esterilizar a pele sem destruí-la. 
  Além  da  atividade  antimicrobiana,  os  anti-sépticos  devem  ser  atóxicos,  não  irritantes 
quando aplicados e devem reter suas propriedades “in vivo”. 
  Muitos  agentes    que  têm  propriedades  antimicrobianas  “in  vitro”  são  ineficazes  quando 
usadas como anti-sépticos, pois são inativados por materiais orgânicos.

6.1 - Pele 
  A  superfície  epidérmica  é  muito  irregular,  composta  de  placas  de  queratina  e 
células mortas, sendo que as bactérias estão presentes sobre e sob estas células mortas. 
TÉCNICA CIRÚRGICA                                                                                      Ney Pippi

  As bactérias presentes na pele são divididas em dois grupos: bactérias transitórias 
e residentes.  
As  bactérias  transitórias  são  as  adquiridas  do  meio  ambiente  pelo  contato  diário 
com material contaminado. São de vários tipos e número, aumentando quando protegidas 
por  dobras  de  pele  ou  outras  estruturas  anatômicas  como  a  cabeça,  unhas,  umbigo  e 
região perineal. 
  As bactérias residentes formam uma população estável que vive e se multiplica na 
pele.  Dentro  desta  categoria  estão  os  estafilococos  de  baixa  patogenicidade  e  outros 
agentes. O tamanho e o tipo variam muito entre indivíduos. 
6.2 – Membranas  mucosas 
  O  ambiente  morno  e  úmido  destas  áreas  é  ideal  para  crescimento  de 
microorganismos, mas normalmente as membranas mucosas formam uma barreira efetiva 
contra  a  invasão para tecidos mais profundos. É mais  fácil remover microorganismos de 
superfície  das  mucosas  do  que  da  pele.  Uma  lavagem  gentil  geralmente  remove  a 
contaminação  mais  grosseira,  sendo  complementada com uma lavagem com anti-séptico 
para remoção de bactérias residuais.

7.1 - Sabões 
    São anti-sépticos fracos e não são muito bons para pele. Seu valor está associado 
ao fato de serem agentes não irritantes, quanto usados com fricção mecânica. 
7.2. - Bifenol 
    Este grupo contém um grande número de compostos usados como anti-sépticos e 
desodorantes.  O  hexaclorofeno  é  muito  importante  em  cirurgia  por  seu  efeito  residual, 
porém é vendido somente por prescrição por ser carcinogênico. 
7.3 - Amônio quaternário 
    Tem como principal representante a Zefiran (cloreto de benzalconio), porém não é 
tão efetivo na pele e é inativado por sabão. 
7.4 - Álcool 
    O  álcool  etílico  é  o  mais  comum  dos  anti-sépticos  para  a  pele  e  geralmente 
superior aos outros álcoois para este fim. 
    O  álcool  isopropílico  é  levemente  superior,  porém  seu  efeito  de  solvente  de 
gorduras  causa  maior  secura  da  pele  que  o  álcool  etílico.  Na  concentração  de  70%  tem 
uma efetividade igual ao etílico de 92%. 
7.5 - Iodo 
    É  muito  popular  na  anti-sepsia,  por  ser  efetivo  e  barato.  Sua  ação  germicida  é 
devido ao elemento iodo, em ambas as formas, aquosa e alcoólica (tintura). 
    A tintura de iodo tem sido recomendada para aplicação na pele de pacientes antes 
das cirurgias.  A solução de iodo também tem sido recomendada como anti-séptico.

  Gema San Iodine - é um detergente cirúrgico a base de iodo. 
  Surgidine - pouco usado no Brasil. 
  Ioprep - anti-séptico pré-cirúrgico, possuindo 1% de iodo livre disponível. 
7.7 - Clorexidine 
    Compõe uma classe diferente de agentes antimicrobianos que atuam aumentando 
a permeabilidade da membrana celular, causando perda de conteúdo citoplasmático.  
    É  efetivo  contra  bactérias,  fungos,  e  vírus,  sendo  superior  ao  hexaclorofeno, 
povidine, iodine e amônio quaternário. 
    Suas formas comerciais são Nolvasan, Hibiclens e Hibitane.

  Entende-se por diérese a separação dos tecidos, realizada por meio de intervenções 
manuais.  Tem-se  diferentes  tipos  de  diérese,  de  acordo  com  o  tecido  a  ser  separado,  ou 
seja, diérese da pele, de aponeurose, de músculo e de órgãos específicos.

  A pele pode ser considerada um sistema, pois possui, além da epiderme e a derme, 
um  aporte  vascular  e  nervoso  próprios,  e  seus  anexos  como  as  glândulas  sebáceas  e 
sudoríparas e os folículos pilosos. Desempenha também funções altamente especializadas, 
como  parte  dos  mecanismos  de  defesa,  regulação  da  pressão  sangüínea,  receptores 
dolorosos  (nociceptores)  e  sensitivos,  além  de  servir  de  “membrana”  que  proporciona  a 
individualidade dos seres. 
  Instrumental  -  a  separação  da  pele  pode  ser  feita  com  o  bisturi,  tesoura  e  bisturi 
elétrico. Recentemente o raio laser tem sido usado para abordagens de tecidos e pode ser, 
de acordo com alguns autores, enquadrado como instrumento de diérese. 
  Técnica: desenvolve-se a partir de vários tempos:

  ligeira escarificação com a ponta do bisturi; 
  com o auxílio do azul de metileno; 
  com agulhas hipodérmicas; 
  compressão com fio e escarificação, em áreas arredondadas ou convexas.

2.2- Secção de pele 
    O  cirurgião  destro  fixa  e  distende  a  pele  com  a  mão  esquerda  (pode  ser 
auxiliado pelo assistente) e empunha o bisturi com a mão direita, fazendo com que 
a lâmina deslize com a superfície cortante em ângulo reto sôbre a pele. O cirurgião 
canhoto usa as posições inversas. 
    A fixação da pele pode ser feita com as mãos, pinças ou agulhas de injeção.
  Na  secção  da  pele  deve  ser  observado  o  sentido  da  incisão,  que  deve  ser 
realizada  na  direção  crânio  caudal,  quando  o  cirurgião  destro  tiver  a  cabeça  do 
paciente  colocada  do  seu  lado  esquerdo.  Deve  ser  também  no  sentido  distal-
proximal com relação ao cirurgião e de cima para baixo. 
2.3- Tipos de secção de pele 
a)  Magistral  -  a  incisão  é  feita  com  um  só  movimento  ou  traço,  sem  levantar  o 
bisturi,  movendo-se  o  pulso  ao  mesmo  tempo  que  se  traciona  o  braço.  O  bisturi 
deve ser empunhado como um lápis ou faca. 
b) Secção magistral breve - consta de uma incisão rápida, onde é feito somente o 
movimento de pulso - indicada para pequenas incisões (5 ou 6 centímetros). 
c)  Serrilhada  -  usada  quando  o  bisturi  não  tem  fio  e  os  movimentos  são  como 
quando se usa uma serra ou faca de pão. 
d) Punção  –  é  feita  uma  pequena  incisão,  introduzindo  o  bisturi  pela  ponta,  em 
uma posição quase que vertical. 
e)  Transfixação  -  o  bisturi  penetra  com  a  parte  cortante  voltada  para  cima  e 
secciona  desde  a  profundidade  para  a  superfície,  a  medida  que  o  vai  sendo 
removido. 
f)  Secção circular - aconselha-se marcar a linha de incisão, que pode ser feita em 
um ou dois tempos. 
g) Secção  com  bisturi  ampliada  com  tesoura  -  onde  a  epiderme  é  seccionada 
com  o  bisturi  e  a  derme  com  a  tesoura.  Não  é  muito  usada  em  Medicina 
Veterinária. 
h) Secção com tesoura - quando usada é devido à ausência do bisturi ou em casos 
de recortes em cirurgia reparadora. 
3 3. . D DE ES SP PR RE EG GA AM ME EN NT TO O C CU UT TÂ ÂN NE EO O 
  Usado quando é necessário desprender a pele do tecido subcutâneo, onde as bordas 
de  pele  são  pinçadas  e  o  tecido  subcutâneo  é  seccionado  com  bisturi  ou  afastado  com 
tesoura (introduzida fechada e aberta no interior dos tecidos). 
  Este despregamento pode ser em 3 planos:   - subdérmico 
              - subcutâneo 
              - supra-aponeurótico

  Quando o paciente é magro, o tecido subcutâneo é escasso, sendo seccionado pelo 
bisturi com a pele. Se o indivíduo for obeso, é necessário seccionar várias vezes antes de 
ser transposta esta camada de gordura. 
4.1- Métodos de diérese subcutânea

Secção magistral: com previa diérese de pele; 
Seção  por  planos:  onde  são  feitas  tantas  incisões  quantas  necessárias  para  se 
atingir o tecido aponeurótico; 
Seção com bisturi e tesoura: incisão com o bisturi, dissecação romba com tesoura 
(tesoura na posição vertical); 
Secção com tesoura: onde, com o auxílio de pinças, eleva-se o tecido subcutâneo 
e secciona-se.

  Geralmente  a  linha  de  secção  da  aponeurose  superficial  é  a  mesma  da  incisão 
cutânea. Esta secção é uma etapa importante da diérese, pois na reconstrução por planos, 
na  síntese,  é  a  aponeurose  que  fornece  o  suporte  necessário  para  uma  adequada  sutura 
muscular. 
6.1 - Exposição da aponeurose 
  Antes de ser incisada, a aponeurose deve ser preparada ou limpa (afastamento  do 
tecido subcutâneo ou adiposo do local onde será feita a incisão), por meio de movimentos 
laterais com a lâmina do bisturi. 
6.2 - Secção da aponeurose 
  O  sentido  da  incisão  pode  ser  distal-proximal,  proximal-distal,  ou  por  incisões 
divergentes, se feitas com o bisturi ou tesoura respectivamente. 
6.3 - Tipos de secção 
Com bisturi - da esquerda para a direita (pessoas destras); 
Com tesoura - mediante prévio orifício feito com o bisturi ou tesoura; 
Com tesoura - mediante prévia dissecação; 
Sobre tentacânula – com prévia introdução deste instrumento. 
6.4 - Desprendimento da aponeurose 
  Quando necessário, faz-se uma tração suave com uma pinça de tecido e separa-se o 
tecido com tesoura.

  Os músculos são estruturas importantes, pois são através deles que se tem acesso a 
estruturas  mais  profundas,  como  ocorre  na  maioria  das  intervenções.  Às  vezes  não  é 
necessário  incisar  um  músculo,  e  sim  dissecá-lo.  Uma  correta  dissecação  e  diérese 
muscular permite uma boa abordagem cirúrgica, assim como uma perfeita reconstrução da 
ferida cirúrgica, com o que se previne eventual deiscência. 
  Os músculos pacientes de dissecação ou diérese sofrem uma reação cicatricial que 
limita seu funcionamento em maior ou menor grau.

7.1- Instrumental 
  Para a diérese aguda, usar o bisturi e para a romba usar a tesoura ou as mãos ou os 
dedos. 
7.2- Técnica de dissecação 
  Dissecar um músculo significa desprendê-lo parcial ou totalmente dos tecidos que 
o  rodeiam  (aponeuroses  e  músculos  vizinhos),  respeitando  os  nervos  e  vasos.  Primeiro 
expõe-se a face superficial, após as laterais e por último a profunda. 
7.3- Técnica de diérese muscular 
Simples  -  Quando  todos  os  planos  são  incisados  na  mesma  direção  da 
incisão da pele. Usada no flanco de bovinos. 
 
 
Complexa  -  quando  os  planos  musculares  são  atravessados  no  sentido  de 
suas  fibras,  sem  se  levar  em  conta  a  direção  da  incisão  de  pele.  Usada  no 
flanco de eqüínos.

  Existem alguns métodos para segurar um  bisturi, dependendo muito onde e como 
vai ser usado: 
a)  Como  uma  faca,  onde  o  dedo  indicador  posiciona-se  sobre  a  porção  dorsal 
posterior da lâmina, com a finalidade de controlar a pressão dessa sobre o tecido a 
ser enfocado. Usar esta posição para as incisões de pele e de tecidos mais duros. 
 
b) Como  um  lápis,  podendo  dessa  maneira  ser  manipulado  pelos  dedos  sem 
movimentar  o  pulso.  Usado  para  dissecação  e  incisões  delicadas,  onde  não  há 
necessidade de pressão sobre o tecido a ser incisado. 
 
 
c)  Para  limpeza  ou  afastamento  do  tecido  gorduroso  ou  aponeurose,  ou  ainda 
dissecação sobre estruturas, o bisturi é manipulado em ângulo oblíquo em relação 
aos tecidos.

Tesouras  para  cortar  fios  cirúrgicos  -  geralmente  são  tesouras  retas  ponta 
reta romba, e devem ser usadas para fios que não arames ou metálicos. As tesouras 
para cortar fios metálicos são especiais e menores que as cirúrgicas. 
Para cortar fios cirúrgicos, abrem-se pouco as lâminas, que deslizam sobre 
as pontas a serem cortadas e viradas levemente antes das lâminas cortarem o fio. O 
tamanho do fio cortado vai depender do grau de rotação da tesoura. 
Tesouras  para  tecidos  devem  ser  usadas  sempre  que  se  possa  ver  o  tecido 
entre suas lâminas. 
Tesouras  para  dissecação  romba,  inserir  as  lâminas  fechadas  e  abri-las,

  Os  fios  são  geralmente  classificados  em  dois  grandes  grupos:  absorvíveis  e  não 
absorvíveis. 
  Fios  absorvíveis:  são  aqueles  que  sofrem  degradação  e  rapidamente  perdem 
sua tensão de estiramento em 60 dias. 
  Fios não absorvíveis: são aqueles que retêm a força de tensão por mais de 60 
dias. 
  Os  fios  ainda  podem  ser  classificados  como  naturais  e  sintéticos.  Dentro  dos 
materiais naturais absorvíveis tem-se o categute cirúrgico e o colágeno. Material sintético 
absorvível é o ácido poliglicólico (Dexon), poliglactina 910 (Vycril) e Maxon. 
  Nas fibras naturais não absorvíveis (incluindo os metais), tem-se a seda, algodão e 
o tântalo. 
  Materiais  sintéticos  não  absorvíveis  incluem  as  poliamidas  (náilon,  caprolactam 
polimerizado),  poliéster,  novafil,  plásticos  poliolefino  (polipropileno  epolietileno)  e 
polibutester.

5.1- Categute 
  O categute cirúrgico ainda é o fio mais usado em suturas até agora. 
  É  preparado  tanto  da  submucosa  do  intestino  delgado  de  ovinos  ou  da  camada 
serosa  do  intestino  delgado  de  bovinos.  Teve  seu  nome  originariamente  dito  por  ser 
espichado como uma corda, porém mais tarde foi mudado para gato jovem (do inglês “kit” 
e “cat”). 
  É um material capilar, multifilamentoso, composto de muitas tiras que são torcidas 
em máquinas, polidas de maneira a ter uma superfície regular e macia que parecem ser de 
fio  monofilamentoso.  É  tratado  com  formaldeído  e  esterilizado  por  radiação  ionizável. 
Não pode ser autoclavado, pois o calor desnatura as proteínas e causa perda de tensão. A 
absorção do categute após seu implante obedece a um mecanismo de duas partes: primeiro 
a  perda  da  tensão  de  estiramento  resulta  na  separação  molecular  por  ação  de  ácidos 
hidrolíticos  e  atividades  colagenolítica;  segundo,  a  digestão  e  absorção  são  feitos  por 
enzimas  proteolíticas  que  ocorre  tardiamente.  Devido  a  sua  composição  de  colágeno,  o 
categute  estimula  uma  significante  reação  tipo  corpo  estranho  nos  tecidos.  O  categute 
possui  uma grande variação na absorção e na perda da tensão superficial, o que o coloca 
em posição de inferioridade quando comparado com os fios sintéticos absorvíveis. 
  Uma absorção prematura acontece quando o categute é exposto às secreções ácidas 
(pepsina)  do  estômago,  ambiente  infectado,  ou  tecidos  muito  vascularizados.  Sua 
absorção  também  é  acelerada  em  pacientes  com  deficiência  protéica.  A  diferença  em 
diâmetro tem pouca influencia no tempo de absorção. 
  O  categute  médio  perde  ao  redor  de  33%  de  sua  tensão  original  após  7  dias  de 
implantado e cerca de 67% após 28 dias. 
  O categute cirúrgico está disponível na forma simples e cromada.  
  O  tratamento  com  sais  de  cromo  resulta  em  um  aumento  das  ligações 
intermoleculares,  tendo  como  resultado  o  aumento  da  tensão  superficial  e  a  resistência  a 
digestão, com decréscimo da reatividade tecidual. 
  A graduação do categute cromado é: 
cromado fraco (tipo B)  - perda da tensão ao redor de 10 dias; 
cromado médio (tipo C) - perda da tensão ao redor de 20 dias;

35 
cromado extra (tipo D) - perda da tensão ao redor de 40 dias. 
  O tipo médio é mais usado em Medicina Veterinária. 
  Comercialmente  é  oferecido nos diâmetros de 7-0 (mais fino) a 4 (mais grosso) e 
vem veiculado em álcool. 
Vantagens - muito bom manuseio, porém quando molhado, escorrega e enfraquece. 
Desvantagens  -  reação  inflamatória  que  provoca  ocasionando  a  irregularidade  na 
absorção. 
5.2- Colágeno 
  O colágeno é composto de material monofilamentoso e foi introduzido em 
1964.  É  feito  de  tendão  flexor  de  bovino,  tratado  com  formaldeído  ou  sais  de 
cromo, ou ambos. 
  Sua  natureza  não  asséptica  e  simplicidade  no  processamento  são  algumas 
vantagens, se comparado ao categute cirúrgico. 
  As  suturas  de  colágeno  são  feitas  atualmente  em  diâmetros  finos  e  são 
usadas quase que exclusivamente em cirurgia oftálmica. 
6 6- - F FI IO OS S D DE E S SU UT TU UR RA A A AB BS SO OR RV VÍ ÍV VE EI IS S D DE E O OR RI IG GE EM M S SI IN NT TÉ ÉT TI IC CA A 
  Esses  tipos  de  suturas  foram  introduzidos  para  reduzir  a  variação  na  absorção  e 
conseqüente perda de tensão superficial associada aos produtos naturais. 
6.1- Ácido poliglicólico (pga) - dexon 
É  um  polímero  multifilamentoso  do  ácido  glicólico  (ácido  hidroxiacético) 
que  foi  descrito  pela  primeira  vez  em  1970.  Seu  nome  comercial  é  Dexon,  nos 
tamanhos 7-0 a 3. 
O método de absorção de Dexon difere do categute. O Dexon é absorvido 
por  hidrólise  não  por  fagocitose,  possivelmente  através  de  esterases.  Existe  a 
hipótese  suspeita  que  os  produtos  de  degradação  do  PGA  são  potentes  agentes 
antibacterianos.  A  absorção  está  associada  com  uma  grande  redução  do  processo 
inflamatório se comparado com o categute. 
    A absorção completa ocorre usualmente em 100 a 120 dias. 
A  hidrólise  do  PGA  se  processa  mais  rápida  em  presença  de  ambiente 
alcalino.  O  Dexon  é  relativamente  forte  e  similar  a  poliglactina  910  e  ao  náilon 
monofilamentoso.  Tem  maior  tensão  de  estiramento  que  o  categute,  seda  e 
algodão. 
A perda da tensão é ao redor de 37% nos primeiros 7 dias após o implante e 
80% em dois dias. Nenhuma tensão está presente aos 28 dias. Devido a sua rápida 
perda  da  tensão  de  estiramento,  o  PGA  é  inferior  aos  materiais  não  absorvíveis 
Calibre de fios

36 
quando  usados em tecidos com cicatrização vagarosa como ligamentos, tendões e 
cápsulas articulares. 
Deve-se  considerar  que  o  Dexon  tem  uma  tensão  de  estiramento  superior 
ao categute durante a fase mais crítica da reparação das feridas. 
O Dexon pode ser usado em grande variedade de procedimentos cirúrgicos  
é bem tolerado não só em feridas limpas mas também em situações de infecção. 
As  desvantagens  do  PGA  incluem  a  tendência  de  cortar  os  tecidos, 
principalmente os friáveis, menor segurança nos nós que o categute. 
  A  fricção  pode  ser  reduzida,  umedecendo  o  fio  antes  do  uso.  A  segurança 
dos nós pode ser aumentada apertando individualmente cada nó. 
6.2- Poliglactina 910 - vicryl 
É  uma  fibra  sintética,  trançada,  composta  de  ácido  glicólico  e  láctico,  em 
uma proporção de 9:1. Esta sutura é trançada para melhorar o manuseio. Seu nome 
comercial é Vicryl. 
    O Vicryl é mais hidrofóbico e mais resistente à hidrólise que o Dexon. 
  Esta  sutura  é  esterilizada  pelo  óxido  de  etileno  e  disponível  coberta  e 
descoberta.  A  cobertura  é  feita  com  uma  mistura  de  esterato  de  cálcio  e  um 
copolímero dos ácidos lactivo e glicolido numa proporção de 65:35. 
O mecanismo de absorção é o mesmo do Dexon (hidrólise), e ocorre entre 
60 e 90 dias após o implante. É mais forte que o PGA em todo tempo do implante, 
principalmente  de  0  a  35  dias.  Esta  sutura  perde  50%  de  sua  tensão  depois  de  14 
dias e 80% após 21 dias. 
Sua  absorção  não  depende  do  diâmetro  da  sutura.  É  mais  forte  que  o 
categute, e é bem tolerado em muitas condições diferentes em feridas. 
Não  promove  nenhuma  manifestação  vascular  aguda  após  o  implante.  As 
reações celulares são predominantemente mononucleares e na vizinhança à área do 
implante. 
6.3- Polidiaxonona (pds) 
Esta sutura sintética monofilamentosa é um polímero da paradioxanona.  É 
esterilizada pelo óxido de etileno, possui grande flexibilidade, maior que o Dexon, 
Vicryl ou polipropileno. 
Sua  degradação  é através da hidrólise, que ocorre em velocidade regular e 
de uma maneira previsível nos tecidos. A perda da tensão de estiramento é menor 
que  do  Dexon  ou  do  Vycril.  Perde  26%  de  sua  tensão  após  duas  semanas,  42% 
após 4 semanas e 86% após 8 semanas. 
A absorção é mais lenta que o Dexon e o Vicryl. Existe ainda evidência aos 
91  dias  e  fica  totalmente  absorvida  em  182  dias  após  o  implante.  Os  produtos  de 
degradação são excretados primariamente pela urina. 
O PDS II é um produto novo que possui todas as características do “velho” 
PDS exceto que o tempo de retenção da tensão do estiramento foi aumentado. Os 
macrófagos e os fibroblastos são as células mais observadas na absorção. 
6.4- Poligliconato - maxon 
Esse  é  um  fio  de  sutura  recente,  produzido  a  partir  de  um  copolimero  do 
carbonato de glicolideo e trimetilene (GTMC). Seu nome comercial é Maxon. Esta

37 
sutura foi feita para ter o desempenho previsível de uma sutura sintética absorvível 
“in vivo” com as características de manuseio de uma sutura monofilamentosa. 
O  Maxon  tem  uma  tensão  de  estiramento  inicial  superior  a  do  Dexon, 
Vicryl e polidiaxanona. 
É  degradado  por  hidrólise.  Retém  a  tensão  de  estiramento  em  81%  ao  14 
dias, 59% em 28 dias e 30% em 42 dias. 
 
De  uma  maneira  geral,  a  meia  vida  da  tensão  (tempo  em  que  a  tensão 
diminui em 50%) das suturas sintéticas absorvíveis é: 
Dexon - 2 semanas 
Vicryl - 2 semanas 
Maxon - 3 semanas 
Polidioxanona - 6 semanas.

  De origem natural:  
seda 
algodão 
metais 
7.1- Seda 
A seda é obtida da larva do bicho da seda. Está disponível na forma torcida 
ou trançada. Pode ser tratada por imersão em óleo vegetal, cera ou silicone, a fim 
de  diminuir  a  capilaridade.  Apesar  de  ser  classificada  como  uma  sutura  não 
absorvível, ela pode ser absorvida a longo prazo. A seda perde 30% de sua tensão 
de  estiramento  em  duas  semanas,  50%  em  um  ano  e  praticamente  toda  tensão  ao 
redor de dois anos. 
Vantagens: barata, excelente manuseio, e boa segurança nos nós. 
Desvantagens:  maior  reação  tecidual  que  outros  materiais  não  absorvíveis.  Pode 
servir  de  “nidus”  no  sistema  urinário,  ou  promover  úlceras  quando  na  luz  de 
órgãos do sistema gastrintestinal. 
A  cera  ou  o  silicone  diminuem  a  segurança  dos  nós,  e  ela  fica  mais  fraca 
quando molhada. É recomendada para unir tecidos em presença da contaminação. 
7.2- Algodão 
O  algodão  possui  fibras  naturalmente torcidas. Foi introduzido no final da 
década de 1930. 
A  principal  propriedade  é  de  aumentar  sua  tensão  de  estiramento  quando 
molhado.  Outras    vantagens  incluem  uma  melhor  segurança  nos  nós  que  a  seda, 
perda lenta da tensão de estiramento (50% em 6 meses e 70% em dois anos). 
Desvantagens:  provoca  uma  reação  tecidual  semelhante  à  da  seda,  potencializa 
infecções, é muito capilar e seu manuseio não é muito bom. 
7.3- Suturas metálicas 
Aço Inoxidável 
Tem  sido  usado  por  séculos.  É  atualmente  a  única  sutura  metálica 
com  alguma  aceitação.  O  aço  inoxidável  disponível  é  do  tipo  autêntico

38 
contendo  ferro,  cromo,  níquel  e  molibdênio.  Está  disponível  nas  formas 
monofilamentosa ou torcida. 
Vantagens:  não  promove  reação  inflamatória  nos  tecidos,  possui 
maior  tensão  de  estiramento  de  todos  os  materiais  quando  implantado  nos 
tecidos,  possui  a  maior  segurança  nos  nós  de  todos  os  materiais,  pode  ser 
autoclavado, e é recomendado para tecidos com cicatrização lenta. 
A forma monofilamentosa pode ser usada em feridas contaminadas 
e infectadas. 
Desvantagens:  tendência  a  cortar  os  tecidos,  manuseio  pobre 
(principalmente  para  atar  os  nós),  quebra  quando  torcido  muitas  vezes  no 
mesmo  ponto  e  promove  necrose  tecidual  pelo  movimento  dos  tecidos 
contra as pontas não flexíveis. 
 
Outras Suturas Metálicas 
O  tântalo,  o  alumínio  e  a  prata  têm  sido  usados  como  material  de 
sutura, porém sem grande aceitação em cirurgia. O tântalo por ser um metal 
puro, tem sido usado como sutura e como malha para reparação de hérnias. 
      Atualmente, o alumínio, prata e ouro são usados para próteses.

8.1- Poliamidas 
    Náilon e caprolactam polimerizável, poliéster, polibutester. 
 
Náilon 
O  náilon  é  um  termoplástico  que  contém  aminas  e  é  derivado  do 
ácido  adipico.  Encontra-se  disponível  na  forma  de  sutura  mono  e 
multifilamentosa.  Após  sua  implantação,  perde  ao  redor  de  30%  de  sua 
tensão  de  estiramento  em  dois  anos  (o  monofilamentoso).  O  náilon 
multifilamentoso perde toda sua tensão ao redor de 6 meses. A perda desta 
tensão está associada a degradação química do náilon, e há suspeita que os 
produtos de degradação são agentes antibacterianos potentes. 
Vantagens:  é  biologicamente  inerte  não  capilar  na  forma 
monofilamentosa  e  possui  uma  tensão  de  estiramento  similar  a  do 
polipropileno. 
Possui  grande  aplicação  como  material  de  sutura.  A  incidência  de 
infecção  em  tecidos  contaminados  contendo  náilon  monofilamentoso  é 
mais  baixa  do  que  qualquer  outro  material  de  sutura  não  absorvível,  com 
exceção do prolipropileno. Possui mínima diferença microscópica quanto a 
reação  tecidual  se  comparado  ao  aço  inoxidável.  Pode  ser  usado  em 
qualquer  tecido,  porém  não  é  recomendado  para  cavidade  serosa  ou 
sinovial, devido a irritação pela fricção de suas pontas. 
Desvantagens:  pobre  manuseio  e  pouca  segurança  nos  nós.  Possui 
“memória” que é a tendência de reverter a sua configuração original. 
A  segurança  dos  nós  pode  ser  melhorada,  dando-se  4  ou  5  nós,  o 
que prolonga o tempo de realização da sutura.

Caprolactam 
É uma sutura de poliamida multifilamentosa, torcida, da família do 
náilon.  Foi  introduzida  em  Veterinária  ao  redor  de  1940  e  está  disponível 
somente  em  diâmetro  grande,  podendo  ser  esterilizado  por  autoclave.  A 
esterilização química não é suficiente. 
Quando  comparado  ao  náilon,  o  caprolactam  tem  uma  tensão  de 
estiramento  maior,  porém  quando  molhado  perde  ao  redor  de  20%  da 
tensão. 
Promove  mais  reação  inflamatória  quando  usado  em  suturas  de 
pele, que a de um grampo de aço inoxidável. 
 
Poliéster 
É  uma  sutura  multifilamentosa,  disponível  em  forma  simples  e 
coberta,  com  polibutilato,  teflon  e  silicone.  Foi  introduzida  no  final  da 
década de 50. 
Vantagens:  é  muito  forte  -  a  sutura  não  metálica  mais  forte  que 
existe.  As  de  pequeno  diâmetro  promovem  grande  tensão  de  estiramento 
inicial,  com  pequena  perda  após  a  implantação.  Oferece  um  bom  suporte 
para tecidos de lenta cicatrização. 
Desvantagens:  manuseio  limitado,  grande  coeficiente  de  fricção          
(a cobertura geralmente diminui este coeficiente), pobre segurança dos nós 
(recomenda-se  5  nós  apertados),  é  a  mais  reativa  das  suturas  sintéticas 
(reação  comparável  à  do  categute).  Seu  uso  em  feridas  contaminadas  tem 
sido associada com infecção local persistente e reação tecidual exagerada. 
 
Poliolefina 
Este  material  induz  pequena  reação  nos  tecidos  e  é  hidrofóbica. 
Seus dois representantes disponíveis são o polipropileno e o polietileno. 
 
a) Polipropileno 
  Sutura  introduzida  em  1961  e  é  um  polímero  do  propileno, 
um derivado do gás propano. Disponível na cor azul e natural.  
Vantagens:  grande  segurança  nos  nós  (melhor  do  que 
qualquer  outro  material  monofilamentoso,  não  sintético  não 
metálico),  retém  sua  tensão  de  estiramento  após  a  implantação  nos 
tecidos,  não  é  enfraquecido  pelas  enzimas  teciduais  e  é  por  isso 
usado em sutura cardiovascular. 
Devido  a  sua  grande  flexibilidade,  é  recomendado  para  uso 
em  tecidos  que  tenham  capacidade  de  elongação,  como  pele  e 
músculo cardíaco. 
Possui também o menor efeito potencial de transformar uma 
ferida  contaminada  em    infectada.  (grande  resistência  à  infecção 
bacteriana). 
Desvantagens: o fio torna-se escorregadio.

b) Polietileno 
É  uma  sutura  monofilamentosa  com  excelente  tensão  de 
estiramento,  porém  com  muito  pouca  tensão  nos  nós.  Pode  ser 
autoclavado sem perda considerável de tensão. 
O  polietileno  é  semelhante  ao  polipropileno  com  reação  a 
mínima  reatividade  tecidual  e  sua  resistência  a  contaminação 
bacteriana. 
        A maior desvantagem é pouca segurança dos nós. 
 
 
8.1.5- Polibutester 
É  o  único  copolímero  que  é  flexível.  É  monofilamentoso  e 
possui  o  nome  comercial  de  Novafil.  Seu  manuseio  é  considerado 
melhor  que  o  náilon  e  polipropileno,  enquanto  sua  tensão  e 
segurança dos nós são semelhantes. 
 
  Quando  tantos  tipos  de  suturas  estão  disponíveis,  a  seleção  apropriada  pode  ser 
difícil. 
  O  material  de  sutura  deve  ser  escolhido  na  base  de  suas  propriedades  biológicas 
conhecidas e da situação clínica presente no momento. 
  Deve-se  considerar  também  que  determinado  material  é  superior  a  outros  em 
diferentes tipos e ambientes de feridas. 
 
  Princípios a serem observados na escolha de um material de sutura: 
  as suturas devem ser tão ou mais fortes do que os tecidos normais através dos 
quais são colocadas; 
  a pele e a fáscia são os tecidos mais fortes, sendo que o estômago, intestino e 
bexiga urinária são os mais fracos; 
  as suturas não são necessárias após a ferida ter cicatrizado; 
  as  feridas  viscerais  cicatrizam  rapidamente,  mantendo  a  tensão  entre  14  e  21 
dias, sendo que as suturas absorvíveis são mais adequadas para estes tecidos. 
  a  fáscia  e  a  pele  cicatrizam  com  mais  vagar,  sendo  as  suturas não absorvíveis 
as mais indicadas; 
  suturas  monofilamentosas  suportam  mais  contaminação  do  que  as  suturas 
multifilamentosas; 
  suturas sintéticas são superiores às suturas naturais; 
  ácido poliglicólico, poliglactina 910, polidioxanona, náilon monofilamentoso e 
polipropileno  têm  a  menor  incidência  de  infecção  quando  usado  em  tecidos 
contaminados. 
  as condições mecânicas das suturas devem ser similares a dos tecidos a serem 
unidos.

  A seleção da sutura apropriada envolve a escolha do tipo e tamanho certos. 
  As  suturas  são  medidas  em  sistema  métrico  ou  USP.  O  menor  tamanho  é  10-0

Método Alternativo - colocação de luvas com o auxílio de assistente: 
Após um membro da equipe cirúrgica estar com avental e luvas, é geralmente mais 
rápido  ajudar  os  outros  membros  a  calçarem  as  luvas.  O  assistente  pega  a  luva  direita  e 
insere 4 dedos de ambas as mãos debaixo do punho. Uma mão deve estar com o polegar 
de  um  lado  e  o  dedo  mínimo  do  outro,  com  a  palma  da  mão  virada  em  direção a pessoa 
que  está  calçando  a  luva.  O  assistente  segura  os  punhos  abertos,  a  uma  altura  média.  O 
cirurgião insere suas mãos na luva, tendo o cuidado de não tocar nas mãos do assistente a 
segurar a luva aberta.

  A  preparação  cirúrgica  ideal  deve  iniciar  um  dia  antes  da  cirurgia,  devendo  o 
animal  ser  banhado  (pequenos  animais),  escovado  e  devendo-se  efetuar  a  tricotomia  do 
campo operatório. 
  Campo  operatório  é  a  região  do  corpo  onde  vai  se  praticar  a  cirurgia.  No  campo 
operatório está contido o ponto de eleição, que é onde se fará a incisão. 
  No  dia  da  cirurgia,  após  o  animal  ser  pré-anestesiado,  ou  anestesiado,  o  local  da 
cirurgia é preparado. Se os pelos não foram  removidos previamente deve ser feito agora, 
usando uma máquina elétrica ou um aparelho de barbear. Os pelos removidos devem ser 
aspirados  ou  lavados.  Se  foi  usada  a  máquina  elétrica,  a  região  onde  será  feita  a  cirurgia 
deve ser barbeada com navalha. 
  O  animal  deve  ser  removido  para  a  sala  de  cirurgia,  onde  a  anti-sepsia  final  do 
campo  operatório  é  feita.  Uma  maneira  fácil  de  remover  os  pelos  ainda  existentes  no 
campo operatório é com o uso de esparadrapo. 
  Lavar  o  campo  operatório  com  água  e  sabão,  a  fim  de  remover  a  contaminação 
mais grosseira, até a pele parecer limpa; 
  Lavar  o  campo  operatório  3  vezes  com  sabão  cirúrgico,  usando  esponjas 
esterilizadas da seguinte maneira: 
  iniciar  a  lavagem  do  centro  do  campo,  onde  a  incisão  será  feita, em direção a 
periferia, nunca retornando a área central com a mesma esponja. 
  remover  o  sabão  com  uma  esponja  de  gaze  esterilizada,  seca,  também  do 
centro  para  a  periferia.  Esta  manobra  permite  deixar  uma  película  de  anti-
séptico na pele, que inibirá o crescimento bacteriano; 
  após,  usar  uma  lavagem  com  álcool,  iodo  e  álcool,  deixando-o  secar 
naturalmente, antes ser iniciada a colocação dos panos de campo. 
  Estas  manobras  devem  ser  feitas  de  maneira  gentil,  pois a hiperemia conseqüente 
de  fricção  exagerada  só  servirá  para  aumentar  a  hemorragia  na  pele  e  tecido  subcutâneo 
(variação entre espécies).

Possui um nó inicial, o fio não é cortado, estendendo-se do ponto de origem após 
várias passagens pelos tecidos, onde o fio é cortado após o nó final. 
De acordo com a aparência de suas bordas, as suturas podem ser classificadas em:  
Aposição: as bordas se encostam, no mesmo plano; 
Eversão: maior contato das bordas, que se voltam para fora, formando uma crista 
evertida; 
Inversão: a borda das feridas volta-se para o interior, causando uma invaginação. 
  Sobreposição: uma borda sobre a outra. 
 
Nas suturas interrompidas - cada nó é uma entidade separada - e o rompimento de 
um ponto não envolve a estrutura dos outros. O rompimento de uma sutura contínua leva 
a  destruição  de  toda  a  linha  de  sutura.  São  fáceis  de  serem  colocadas  e  possuem  a 
capacidade de ajustar-se a tensão em cada sutura, de acordo com a tensão nas margens. As 
desvantagens  incluem  o  tempo  maior  de  atarem  os  nós,  aumento  de  volume  de  material 
deixado nas feridas ou de material sepultado. 
As  suturas  contínuas  usam  menos  material,  o  que  minimiza  a  quantidade  de 
material  de  sutura  nos  nós  e  diminui  o  tempo  de  cirurgia.  As  suturas  contínuas  também 
fazem um melhor selamento ao ar e água. 
As  desvantagens  incluem  um  menor  controle  da  tensão  e  a  possibilidade  de 
rompimento.  
A  habilidade  de  uma  sutura  inverter  ou  everter  as  bordas  pode  não  ser  indicada, 
dependendo  da  região  anatômica.  A  inversão  pode  ser  desejável  no  fechamento  de  uma 
víscera oca, porém, não é aconselhável para o fechamento da pele.

Após  o  fechamento  de  uma  ferida,  as  bordas  tornam-se  enfraquecidas  pela 
colagenólise  e  o  suporte  das  suturas  está  enfraquecido.  As  suturas  colocadas  a  uma 
distância  de  mais  de  0,5  cm  das  margens  da  ferida,  aparentemente  não  são  afetadas  pela 
colagenólise. 
A  inflamação  também contribui para diminuir a tensão, é aconselhável colocar as 
suturas  mais  de  0,5  cm  afastadas  das  bordas  em  feridas  muito  traumatizadas.  A  tensão 
máxima  junto  aos  tecidos  é  também  obtida  quando  as  suturas  são  colocadas  a  uma 
distância de 0,5 cm uma das outras. Quando colocadas mais próximas que 0,5 cm, causam 
retardamento  da  cicatrização  devido a reação tecidual  e comprometimento da circulação 
sangüínea nas bordas da ferida. 
Uma boa regra a seguir, é colocar o número de suturas suficiente para dar uma boa 
captação das bordas.

A escolha do tipo de sutura é muito importante.  
Devido  a  forma  helicoidal,  as  suturas  contínuas  têm  uma  tendência  de  reduzir  a 
microcirculação das bordas das feridas. Este fato prolonga a fase destrutiva da cicatrização 
aumentando  a  formação  de  edema.  Um  ganho  mais  rápido  em  força  de  tensão  é  obtido 
com  as  suturas  simples interrompidas. Estatisticamente, as suturas simples interrompidas 
são mais fortes que as contínuas. 
       De maneira geral, as suturas interrompidas são preferidas quando se quer mais tensão, 
mobilidade dos tecidos e distensibilidade. 
 
4.1 - Suturas interrompidas 
1 – Sutura Interrompida Simples 
É a mais usada de todas as suturas e também a mais versátil. Quando colocada de 
maneira apropriada, mantém uma boa aposição, tem ação independente das outras na linha 
de  sutura  e  permite  mobilidade  tecidual  entre  as  suturas.  A  técnica  é  fácil  e  rápida.  A 
sutura  é  colocada  direcionando  a  agulha  através  do  tecido  a  mais  de  0,5  cm  da  borda 
incisada.  A  sutura  é  inserida  perpendicularmente  através  do tecido de um lado, passando 
através de igual quantidade de tecido no lado oposto e o nó é amarrado. Os nós devem ser 
colocados fora da linha de incisão. 
As  pontas  dos  fios  devem  ser  deixadas  longas  (0,5  a  1,0  cm),  ou  curtas  se  o  nó 
ficar  escondido.  O  próximo  ponto  interrompido  deve  ser  colocado  a  uma  distância  igual 
ao  tamanho  do  ponto  anterior  (ex:  0,5  +  0,5  cm  =  1  cm  de  distância).  O  sentido  da 
colocação  dos  pontos  deve  ser  da  direita  para  a  esquerda  em  incisões  horizontais,  se 
destro,  ou da esquerda para a direita, se canhoto. Se a incisão for vertical, usualmente se 
inicia a sutura da porção distal para a proximal da incisão. 
Esta é uma sutura de aposição, porém, se tiver pressão em demasia, poderá causar 
inversão indesejável, complicando a cicatrização. 
A  colocação  apropriada  dos  pontos  mais  uma  tração  moderada  nos  nós,  permite 
um  resultado  bem  satisfatório.  Quando  internos,  os  nós  podem  ser  palpáveis  por  algum 
tempo.  
Usada em suturas internas (vísceras) e externas (pele).

2 - Sutura Horizontal em “U”, de Wolff  
 
Ë  uma  sutura  que  promove  uma  leve  eversão  se  colocada  de  maneira  apropriada. 
Ela  forma  um  quadrado  perfeito,  com  ambas  extremidades  de  sutura  saindo  pelo  mesmo 
lado ou borda da ferida.  
Está indicada para suturar feridas sob tensão moderada. 
Vantagens: 
-  uso de menor quantidade de material de sutura; 
-  é de execução rápida; 
-  pode  ser  usada  como  sutura  de  tensão  quando  colocada  longe  das  bordas  da 
pele;                                       
-  pode ser usada para reduzir espaço morto. 
Desvantagens: 
-  dificuldade relativa quando aplicada na pele; 
-  formação de cicatriz excessiva devido a eversão das bordas; 
-  tendência  a  reduzir  o  suprimento  sangüíneo  das  bordas  da  ferida,  quando  so 
pontos são apertados demais (em função do formato geométrico). 
3 - Sutura Vertical em “U”, de Donatti 
 
Promove  uma  aposição  completa    e  precisa  das  bordas,  com  leve  eversão 
após a confecção dos nós. A primeira passagem da agulha é feita a uma distância  
maior do que 0,5 cm da borda e a Segunda passa de 2 ou 3 mm da borda. 
Vantagens: 
-  mínima alteração do suprimento sangüíneo, se colocado distante da borda;

-  pode  ser  usada  como  sutura  de  tensão  como  ajuda  a  uma  primeira  linha  de

4 - Sutura em “X”ou Cruzado ( Sultan ) 
 
É uma sutura de aposição, sendo uma modificação do “U” horizontal. 
A agulha penetra de um lado da incisão e passa perpendicularmente através 
da  mesma,  e  uma  segunda  passagem  é  feita  através  dos  tecidos,  paralela  e  de  5  a 
10 mm da primeira passagem. 
Vantagens: 
-  não promove alteração do suprimento sangüíneo, mesmo sob tensão; 
-  previne a eversão dos tecidos.

5 - Longe-perto-perto-longe 
 
É uma combinação de sutura com sutura de tensão. Faz um movimento de espiral. 
Sua  principal  indicação  é  quando  a  pele  requer  tensão  moderada  para  aposição.  O 
componente longe atua como redutor de tensão, ao passo que o perto faz aposição. 
A tração excessiva dos fios deve ser evitada, para prevenir a inversão da incisão. A 
força  de  tensão  obtida  com  esta  sutura  é  maior  do  que  a  obtida  com  sutura  interrompida 
simples.

4.2 - Suturas contínuas 
    As suturas contínuas não têm os fios cortados após a aplicação dos nós. 
 
Sutura contínua simples ou sutura de Kurschner 
Consiste  em  usar  uma  série  de  pontos  interrompidos  com  nós  no 
início  e  no  final  da  sutura.  A  agulha  é  introduzida  através  dos  tecidos, 
perpendicularmente  à  linha  de incisão. A sutura é reintroduzida na mesma 
direção  que  a  anterior.  No  final  da  sutura,  as  pontas  do  fio  são  amarradas 
com, no mínimo quatro camadas de nós (ou seja, duas de cirurgião). Desta 
maneira podem ser executadas com maior facilidade e rapidez. 
São  indicadas  para  o  fechamento  de  tecido  subcutâneo  e  fáscia  desde  que 
não  haja  planos  de  tensão.  Os  nós  são  geralmente  escondidos  (ou 
sepultados). São também usadas em tecidos que requeiram mínima força de 
segurança, porém com aposição máxima.

2 - Sutura Festonada, Retrógrada, Ancorada de Ford ou de Reverdin 
É  uma  modificação  da  sutura  contínua  simples.  A  cada  passagem 
através dos tecidos, o fio é unido ao ponto passado anteriormente.  
A  vantagem  desta  sutura  é  a  grande  estabilidade  na  eventualidade  de 
falha  de  um  nó  ou  de  uma  porção  de  linha  de  sutura.  Quando  isto  acontece, 
necessariamente  não  resulta  em  perda  de  toda  a  sutura.  Uma  grande 
estabilidade  é  obtida  devido  aos  tecidos  apresentarem  menor  tendência  a 
movimentarem-se. 
A  desvantagem  é  a  maior  quantidade  de  material  usado,  mais 
demorada,  e  pode  causar  necrose  na  pele  quando  usada  com  muita  tensão 
(muito apertadas). 
 
 
3 - Sutura de colchoeiro ou “U” contínua 
Pode ser usada na pele quando houver indicação para sutura contínua e um 
certo grau de eversão. 
A sutura inicia como um ponto isolado simples e avança aproximadamente 
1  a  2  cm,  e  uma  segunda  passagem  é  feita  através  dos  tecidos  perpendiculares  à 
incisão.  Após  a  saída  dos  tecidos,  a  agulha  avança  de  1  a  2  cm  e  é  inserida 
perpendicularmente  à  linha  de  incisão  na  direção  contra-lateral.  A  rapidez  no 
fechamento é a principal vantagem desta sutura.

4 - Sutura intradérmica ou subcutânea 
As  suturas  intradérmicas  têm  sido  incorretamente  chamadas  de 
subcuticulares.  Como  diz  o  nome,  sutura  intradérmica  são  colocadas  sob  a 
derme no tecido subcutâneo.  
As  suturas  intradérmicas  e  subcutâneas  são  usadas  mais 
freqüentemente na forma contínua. A sutura inicia escondendo o nó no interior 
dos  tecidos,  seguindo  em  formato  de  zig-zag,  com  a  agulha  colocada 
perpendicularmente à incisão, porém, avançando paralela à incisão.  
Fios  de  nº  3-0  ou  4-0  podem  ser  usados,  e  ao  término,  o  nó  é 
novamente sepultado. 
 
5 - Suturas de tensão 
São  usadas  quando  existe  muita  tensão  na  linha  de  sutura  e  for 
necessária alguma força para o fechamento da ferida. 
Infelizmente  isso  resulta  em  esquemia  local,  corte  das  bordas  e 
deiscência  das  feridas.  Nesses  casos,  o  uso  de  suturas  de  tensão  é  altamente 
benéfico.  Elas  são  colocadas  longe  das  bordas  da  pele,  de  maneira  a  não 
comprometer  o  suprimento  sangüíneo.  As  bordas  da  pele  são  suturadas  por 
meio de pontos interrompidos simples.  
Como  suporte  adicional  a  estas  suturas  de  tensão,  podem  ser  usados  botões, 
tubos de borracha, plástico ou silicone colocados nas suturas antes dos nós. 
A  sutura  de  Donatti  ou  “U”  vertical  promove  bom  suporte  aos  tecidos,  com 
mínima redução do suprimento sangüíneo.

7 – Sutura de Schmieden – aposição sero-mucosa - contaminantes 
São  muito  usadas  em  anastomose  intestinal,  quando  somente  uma  camada  de 
sutura  é  desejável.  O  ponto  é  introduzido  como  uma  sutura  simples  interrompida, 
passando  da  serosa  através  da  muscular  e  mucosa  ao  lume  do  órgão.  A  sutura  volta  do 
lume através da mucosa, à muscular antes de cruzar a incisão. A agulha é reintroduzida na 
muscular  no  lado  oposto  e  continua  através  da  mucosa  do  lume.  É  então  reintroduzida

são apertados de maneira que a sutura penetre nos tecidos.

8 – Sutura de Lembert não contaminante 
É uma sutura invaginante, do tipo contínuo vertical, sendo indicada para o 
fechamento  de  vísceras  ocas.  A  sutura  é aplicada do lado de fora do lume, com a 
agulha  passando  pela  serosa,  muscular  até  a  submucosa,  retornando  a  muscular  e 
serosa para fora da víscera no mesmo lado. A agulha é então passada pela incisão 
ao  lado  oposto  e  introduzida  na  superfície  serosa  adjacente  à  incisão.  É  passada 
através da serosa, muscular e submucosa e daí à serosa distal.  
O  fio  inicial  e  o  final  são  atados.  Um  dos  fios  é  cortado  curto  e  a  agulha 
avança  com  o  outro  em  forma  contínua  vertical  ao  redor  da  víscera.  Este  mesmo 
tipo de sutura pode ser feito como sutura interrompida.  
Uma  sutura de Lembert  com somente duas passagens paralelas e reversas 
no tecido (“U” interrompido  invertido), é chamada de sutura de Halsted.  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 - Sutura de Conell e Cushing não contaminante 
A  sutura  de  Connell  penetra  o  lumen  da  víscera,  porém,  a  Cushing  passa 
somente ao nível da submucosa (a camada mais resistente nas vísceras ocas). São 
suturas contínuas invaginantes, de forma horizontal.  
Iniciam  com  uma  sutura  “U”,  vertical  invertida,  e  do  ponto  de  saída  da 
agulha  inicia  a  sutura  que  avança  paralela  à  linha  de  incisão  e  é  introduzida  na 
serosa,  passando  através  da  muscular,  submucosa  (Cushing)  e  mucosa  (Connell) 
no lume. Do lumen ou da submucosa a agulha avança para frente paralela à incisão 
e retorna à serosa através da muscular, no mesmo lado da incisão. Uma vez fora da 
víscera,  a  agulha  e  o  fio  são  passados  pela  incisão  e  introduzidos  no  ponto  que 
corresponde à saída do fio no lado oposto. A agulha é reinserida através da serosa, 
muscular  submucosa  (Cushing)  e  mucosa  (Connell),  avança  paralelamente  à 
incisão e sai ao exterior novamente.

A  sutura  deve  ser  tracionada  de  tempos  em  tempos  para  favorecer  a

Dog Walker 
(Passeador de cães)  
O que é um Dog Walker Canis Care? 
Com o crescimento da população canina nas 
famílias brasileiras, há uma busca por serviços que 
auxiliem na criação de nossos bichinhos: são pet 
shops, veterinários, adestradores, padarias 
especializadas e a última geração de profissionais 
ligada aos cães: os passeadores ou Dog 
Walkers.  
Dog Walker Canis Care é um profissional com 
conhecimentos específicos em comportamento 
animal, particularidades sobre raças, fisiologia, 
cinologia e biologia, preparado para exercer a 
atividade de passeio recreativo e educacional para 
cães. 
 
  
A prática de contratar um profissional para passear com cães é tradicional em grandes metrópoles 
européias e americanas. Atualmente esse tipo de serviço é muito procurado           no 
Brasil.                                                                                                                      
 
Segundo o conceituado dicionário Houaiss, passear consiste em “ir ou conduzir (alguém           ou um 
animal) a algum lugar, com o fito de entreter ou exercitar; percorrer em passeio”. 
  
Como se pode perceber, o conceito de passear é muito mais abrangente do que  
simplesmente caminhar ou andar com o cão. E é isso o que um Dog Walker Canis Care oferece. Ele 
conduz o cão a locais agradáveis, onde possa interagir com o meio, através  
de brincadeiras e atividades físicas previamente elaboradas e dirigidas a ele. 
  
Serviço 
 
O serviço de passeios e condicionamento físico para cães de todas as raças e  
portes desponta como a solução para proprietários que, por motivos diversos,  
não possuem disponibilidade para exercitar regularmente seus animais de  
estimação, todavia se preocupam e procuram um meio de satisfazer a  
necessidade por atividades físicas e entretenimento que nossos melhores  
amigos requerem. 
 
Muitas pessoas criam seus cães em apartamentos e os passeios convencionais  
(volta ao quarteirão), por vezes não são suficientes para uma melhor qualidade de  
vida e saúde. Os passeios compostos de exercícios e brincadeiras garantem saúde 
e bem-estar. O contato social e com a natureza é muito importante para uma vida  
saudável e feliz de  qualquer animal. 
  
Por que passear? 
  
Passeios periódicos evitam uma série de problemas comportamentais, como roer  
móveis, sapatos, urinar em lugares inadequados e até agressividade para com o  
dono,  além de gerar bem-estar físico e psíquico. Deixá-los presos durante todo o  
dia pode acarretar problemas de saúde, os quais, por causa do sedentarismo,  
assim como nos seres humanos, ocasionam obesidade, problemas nas articulações  
e doenças cardíacas. Ao se restringir a atividade física, diminui-se a liberação de  
endorfina (hormônio relacionado à sensação de prazer), desta forma têm-se mais  
chances do cão tornar-se agressivo. 
 
Alguns cães são muitos apegados aos seus donos e podem desenvolver a  
"ansiedade de separação". São cães que, quando deixados sozinhos, adquirem um  
conjunto de comportamentos indesejáveis que, se mal interpretados por seus donos,  
darão a impressão de  de serem rancorosos, chateados e raivosos. 
 
Ao incluir o passeio recreativo-educacional na rotina do cão, ele se tornará mais  
confiante, tranqüilo e sociável. O passeio traz para o cão, assim como o exercício  
físico traz para as pessoas, uma sensação de bem-estar. No passeio, além de  
muito exercício físico, obtém-se contato com odores, sons e estímulos visuais  
diversos. 
  
Vantagens para seu melhor amigo: 
  
 
- Evita distúrbios de comportamento;  
- Diminui a ansiedade;  
- Previne a obesidade;  
- Melhora a relação animal/proprietário;  
- Aumenta a qualidade e perspectiva de vida do animal;  
- Melhora a socialização com outros animais;  
- Previne as "fobias" caninas como medo de trânsito, 
aglomerações e agressividade; 
- Diminui latidos indesejáveis causados por ansiedade e 
agitação;  
- Gera qualidade de vida para o animal.  
  
Como funciona? 
  
1º  passo – Agende uma visita: 
Este procedimento é muito importante, pois estaremos conhecendo você e o seu  
cãozinho e apresentando a metodologia de trabalho que envolve a Dogwalker Canis Care,  
para que você tenha maior segurança em deixar o seu amigo conosco. Será preenchido um cadastro 
com informações sobre a rotina, saúde e temperamento do cão. Junto a  
este será anexado um pequeno dossiê sobre as particularidades e necessidades da raça. Assim 
você terá um serviço personalizado de acordo com as suas necessidades e de  
seu cão. 
  
2º  passo – Período de adaptação: 
De acordo com o pacote adquirido haverá um período de adaptação, estabelecido entre o 
passeador e o proprietário conforme as necessidades do animal. Este período de 
adaptação inclui tempo de passeio, modo de passeio (individual ou em grupo) e  
ambientação.  
  
Os Passeios 
  
Os passeios são feitos de 2 a 5 vezes por semana, um período por dia, com duração de 
60 minutos. Os locais dos passeios deverão ser próximos à residência do animal, de   
preferência praças ou parques bem arborizados e em horários cuja incidência do sol é  
amena. O cão beberá água durante o passeio (fazendo uso do petdrink), brincará (fazendo 
uso de bolinhas e brinquedos especialmente elaborados para o mercado PET), e, em           
caso de evacuações, as fezes serão devidamente recolhidas. O cão será escovado e terá      
as patas limpas antes de ser entregue. Nos casos de indisponibilidade climática, feriados  
ou qualquer outra eventualidade, será feita a transferência do passeio para outro dia de  
acordo com a contratação do pacote. 
 
Prezamos as seguintes condições: 
   Vacinas em dia: Raiva, V8, tosse dos canis e vacina de giárdia; 
   Controle de pulgas e carrapatos; 
   Vermifugação de 3 em 3 meses; 
   Fêmeas não podem estar no cio (recomendável); 
  Não apresentar histórico de ataques (a pessoas ou outros animais). 
Material utilizado nos passeios: 
   Petdrink (recipiente para água); 
   Brinquedos (especializados para uso Pet); 
   Petiscos (de acordo com a dieta do cão); 
   Lenços umedecidos (para higienização das patas após o passeio); 
   Escova (para escovação dos pelos após o passeio);

     positive reinforcement, negative    environmental manipulation is easily accomplished, even by inexperienced

                                            Behavior modification involves the implementation of learning principles to
                                         change a behavior. Most behavior modification programs rely heavily on posi-
                                         tive reinforcement and on techniques that involve operant and classical condi-

If your dog barks and lunges at distractions or just drags you on walks, one helpful 
strategy is to perform fun exercises that help your dog focus on you. These 
exercises work best if you adopt quick, precise treat delivery and movement speed 
as well as posture and arm positions that make your signals clear.  
The following is a set of patterns for combining simple exercises:

Foreword

‘Let food be thy medicine’
Hippocrates (460-377 BC)

ince its establishment in 1968 by the veterinarian Jean Cathary, true to its
values of ‘Knowledge and Respect, Royal Canin has shared a common goal
with the veterinary community: improving the health and the longevity of
dogs and cats worldwide.

S

The Royal Canin Center for Research and Development has developed innovative nutritional programs dedicated exclusively to veterinarians, based on a twopronged preventive and curative approach.
With this expanded approach to health, Royal Canin has built the foundations
of a solid partnership with veterinarians. The aim is to contribute to the development of their activities rather than trying to eclipse them in favor of other
players in the nutrition market.
In the pursuit of this shared goal – improving the health of dogs and cats – the number one priority is to enhance the status of the veterinarian profession by:
1. sharing scientific knowledge acquired through practical experience
2. bringing innovation firmly anchored in scientific fact and characterized by measured clinical efficacy
3. creating specific and unique tools and services
Essentially, strengthening the veterinarian’s advisory role in nutrition through the quality and exclusivity of products and
giving a new meaning to the prescription of food through a variety of services offered to veterinarians.
The field of nutrition prescribed by the veterinarian to support the treatment – known as clinical nutrition – or to help
prevent disease is the common ground on which the veterinarian profession and Royal Canin meet every day.
Our ambition with this encyclopedia was to draw together the latest advancements in Canine Clinical Nutrition in a single
publication, from the perspective of clinicians and nutritionists – something that has never before been done.
This new publication is another in the long list of communication tools produced by Royal Canin for veterinarians around
the globe. A list that includes the encyclopedias of dogs and of cats, Focus magazine and the special editions of Focus, as
well as the Scientific Meetings.
More than ever, this Encyclopedia of Canine Clinical Nutrition, produced in association with eminent experts from the world
of veterinary medicine, has been driven by the desire to share the knowledge that Royal Canin has acquired since its establishment.
Nutrition always has an impact on the clinical expression of some pathologies and to achieve its clinical and educational
objectives this Encyclopedia offers a panorama that is both broad and deep, brought to life in full-color illustrations.
Produced under the supervision of the Royal Canin Center for Research and Development, this Encyclopedia of Canine
Clinical Nutrition was conceived in the spirit of collaboration with our scientific partners.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to all those whose high-quality and precise work has enabled the production of
this Encyclopedia.

anine obesity is a condition that leads to serious alterations in
various bodily functions and limits the longevity of the animal.
It is the most common nutrition-related canine disease in
industrial countries, but its treatment is effective. The prevention
of obesity demands nutritional discipline throughout the life of
the animal and specifically at certain key times when the risk
of becoming overweight is increased. The treatment of canine
obesity is complicated by various problems, including a lack of
awareness among owners, who often fail to recognize or minimize
their animal’s obesity. Without the total cooperation of owners,
it will be impossible to obtain weight loss in the dog.
The veterinarian will therefore first have to convince
the owner before implementing weight loss protocols
and obese animal care.

Obesity

1 - Canine obesity

While various stages or degrees of weight gain can be distinguished in dogs, in this summary we use the term “obesity” to qualify any pathological weight gain. We strive to define obesity, to explain its pathogenesis and related problems, its evaluation, the various
types of diet and the practical treatment of this disease.

1 - Canine obesity
Obesity is a “pathological condition characterized by excessive fat deposition leading to
modifications to various bodily functions.” The World Health Organization (WHO,
1997) goes even further, defining human obesity as “excessive fat leading to harmful
consequences for health.” Although this definition appears fairly brutal, it can certainly be extrapolated to companion animals. At a quantitative level, obesity is described
as being 15% overweight as compared to optimal weight. This somewhat reduced
approach is no longer used as such; it has been replaced by body mass indices, which
determine an optimal weight range for men and women of a given size. No such tool
exists for dogs. A “mathematical” definition of obesity is of little use (Markwell & Butterwick, 1994) as it requires knowledge of the healthy weight, which, even for purebreed dogs is not always easy to determine. The ideal situation is to know the weight of
the adult dog before it became obese. This body weight is used as a benchmark in both
the initial and follow-up evaluations of the animal. In some cases, the optimal body
weight is unknown as the animal has always been overweight, even during the growth
phase.

Definition

Body condition scores are practical, specific tools
that have been developed for veterinarians (see
below). A dog is obese when its body condition
score is more than 3 on a 5-grade scale.

Obesity

In the most recent studies, the frequency of obesity in dogs presented at consultation varies from
24% to 44% depending on the author (Table 1), the epidemiological study location and the predefined criteria (Mason, 1970; Meyer et al, 1978; Edney & Smith, 1986; Armstrong & Lund, 1996;
Robertson, 2003).
These data do not always reflect the local situation. Some studies continue to serve as a reference
despite being over 30 years old, while others have been conducted in a limited number of veterinary clinics and do not necessarily reflect differences between countries. Nevertheless, all studies
conducted in veterinary consulting rooms in industrialized countries and large cities show a prevalence of obese dogs of at least 20%. A telephone survey conducted among 400 veterinarians in
four European countries (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom) in May 2000 showed that these veterinarians estimate the proportion of obese dogs (where obese is associated with
the necessity of implementing a low calorie diet) to be 20% (Royal Canin, 2000).
In conclusion, the epidemiological data does not prove that the frequency of obesity has been
increasing for 10 years, but obesity is still a major medical problem in the canine population.

• Breed
Breed is an obesity risk factor in the canine species but the predisposed breeds vary depending on
the author and the study. For example, in the United Kingdom the Labrador Retriever, the Cairn
Terrier, the Collie, the Basset Hound, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, the Cocker Spaniel, the
longhaired Dachshund and the Beagle were predisposed and often cited in the 1980s (Edney &
Smith, 1986).
These breeds were very popular in the United Kingdom when the study was conducted. The breeds
that suffer may vary depending on the country and certain other factors. Krook et al (1960) report
that the breeds predisposed to obesity in Sweden were the Rottweiler, the Saint Bernard, the Collie, the Newfoundland, the Scottish terrier and the Chow Chow. Conversely, some breeds – sighthounds and sheepdogs – appear to be more resistant. In a study conducted by Meyer et al (1978)
in Germany, German Shepherds, Poodles and Boxers were frequently obese. It is therefore neces-

sary to qualify this idea of breed predisposition, even though practitioners do
state that they encounter more obese Labrador Retrievers than obese sighthounds. Obesity also appears to be a problem in other breeds (Table 3). The
type of selection may influence the physical condition (and the weight) of
dogs, for example, by substituting beauty or size criteria for working aptitude.
Breed predispositions are partly related to genetic factors, more specifically in
the fat mass/lean mass ratio that determines the maintenance energy requirement (Figure 1).

© Renner

Conversely, the German Shepherd, the Greyhound, the Yorkshire Terrier,
and the Doberman are among the breeds least predisposed to obesity.

The Bernese Mountain Dog is one of the giant breeds
predisposed to developing obesity.

Not all breeds are the same when it comes to nutritional risk
during growth. The energy excess predisposes small-breed dogs
to obesity, whereas the major risk among large breeds is osteoarticular complaints (Grandjean & Paragon, 1996). The association of articular problems and obesity is frequent at the end of
the growth phase of large breeds.

The purpose of a complex system of genetically determined factors is to maintain balance between dietary intake and energy
expenditure. These regulatory mechanisms are particularly
well adapted to helping wild species survive in times of famine. Nevertheless, when food is abundant, these factors do not
appear to maintain a balance between intake and expenditure
in domesticated animals in a confined environment, which has
led to an increase in the obese population. Whatever the case
may be, some individuals become obese while others living in
the same conditions maintain their ideal weight. So it is not
easy to distinguish between environmental factors in a wide
sense and genetic predisposition (Johnson, 2000).

• Genetic factors

The Collie is one of the medium breeds most at risk from obesity.
The Labrador Retriever is one of the large breeds most at risk from obesity.

The frequency of obesity increases with the age of the dog
(Robertson, 2003) and the age of the owner (Edney & Smith,
1986). It is found in only 6% of puppies age 9-12 months, but
in 40% of adult individuals (Glickman et al, 1995). The avera-

Genetic factors leading to obesity in dogs are still poorly understood. It is however, undeniable that these factors play a role
since obesity is particularly common in selected breeds of dogs
and in certain lines. The polygenic nature of obesity is undisputed (Schalling et al, 1999).

The Cairn Terrier and the King Charles Spaniel are among the small dogs predisposed
to developing obesity.

ge age of diagnosis varies from 5 to 8 years. Less than 20% of dogs age 4 years
and younger are obese, although that rises to over 50% in the 7-8-year category and to almost 70% for the 9-years-and-older category (Meyer et al, 1978)
(Table 4). In very old dogs there is a contradiction between the figures cited
by Mason (1970) and more recent data that shows that the frequency of obesity declines in old dogs age over 12 years (Armstrong & Lund, 1996).

© Doxicat

Obese bitches between 9 and 12 months are 1.5 times more likely to become
obese adults than lean bitches during growth (Glickman et al, 1995). By way
of comparison, in humans, 80% of obese adolescents become obese adults and
they are also fatter than those adults that become obese without having being
overweight during growth (Abraham & Nordseick, 1960). These data are
confirmed by epidemiological studies (Eriksson et al, 2003).

An overweight puppy is predisposed
to obesity in adulthood.

• Sex
The various data presented in Table 5 show that females are more predisposed to obesity than
males. In certain studies, females represent more than 60% of obese dogs (Krook et al, 1960; Jerico & Scheffer, 2002). Furthermore, Glickman et al (1995) have observed an obesity percentage of
40% in a study of 289 adult dogs.

1 - Canine obesity

Gonadectomy increases the frequency of obesity in males and especially female dogs (Anderson, 1973; Edney, 1974; Karczewski et al, 1987; Miyake et al,
1988; Robertson, 2003). Edney and Smith (1986) have observed that neutered bitches were twice as likely to be obese compared with intact bitches. A
more recent study shows that this is also true for male dogs. The frequency of
obesity is 32% and 15% in neutered and unneutered animals, respectively,
males and females together (Robertson, 2003). The sexual hormones are not
prime regulators of metabolism, but they nevertheless have a direct impact on
body weight at the level of the central nervous system, or indirectly by modifying cellular metabolism. Moreover, estrogens exercise an inhibitor effect on
feeding. Dietary consumption thus varies in the female’s sexual cycle. It is
minimal during estrus, increases during metestrus and is maximal during anestrus (Houpt et al, 1979).
The influence of premature neutering on the incidence of obesity is not well
known. An American epidemiological study reports that the frequency of obesity is lower in a population of dogs neutered before 5.5 months than in animals neutered between 5.5 and 12 months. The authors also report an overall
incidence of obesity of 27% in the neutered population (Spain et al, 2004).

• Neutering

Various studies show that females are more predisposed
to obesity than males.

ESTIMATION OF THE SCALE OF NEUTERING
IN THE CANINE POPULATION
IN THE UNITED STATES
(From Mahlow, 1999)

While it is difficult to clarify the link between neutering and obesity due to
its multifactorial nature, several explanations may be considered. The first

stated above and the inhibitor effect of estrogens on food consumption. It is

(Jeusette et al, 2004a). This level of energy restriction appears to be high, but
one of the explanations advanced is that the Beagle is particularly predisposed to obesity. Neutering also leads to a reduction in spontaneous activity,
especially among males. This last point is difficult to quantify in the breeding kennel.
The weight gain after neutering may accordingly be prevented with strict dietary measures and
regular exercise. In a study on German Shepherds trained on an obstacle course and used as patrol
dogs, no difference in body weight was apparent between neutered and unneutered bitches,
although they all received the same quantity of food (Le Roux, 1983). This fact demonstrates that
the maintenance of regular exercise after neutering can prevent weight gain.
The scale of neutering in the canine population may explain the increase in the frequency of
obesity since the first epidemiological studies were reported in 1960. Moreover, as the practice of
neutering becomes more and more widespread, we must expect an increase in the frequency of
obesity in the coming years, particularly in those countries that have yet to be affected by obesity.

• Contraceptive treatments
Contraceptive treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate led to a significant weight gain in 17.4%
of the bitches treated during a clinical trial. The authors reported bulimia and obesity in some animals (Picavet & Le Bobinnec, 1994). The increase in weight following this contraceptive treatment
is well documented in the bitch (Harel et al, 1996).

• Obesity and endocrine diseases
Obesity may be associated with certain endocrine diseases, such as diabetes mellitus (Krook et al,
1960; Mattheeuws et al, 1984a; Wolfscheimer, 1990; Ford et al, 1993; Hoenig, 2002) and hypothyroidism (Kaelin et al, 1986; Forbes & White, 1987; Roche et al, 1991; Ford et al, 1993; Panciera,
1994, 2001; Dixon et al, 1999). According to the authors, at least 40% of bitches suffering from
these conditions are obese. Obesity may also be secondary to hyperadrenocorticism. In a clinical
study, five dogs presented fat deposits typical of obesity and different from a pendulous abdomen
(Spearman & Little, 1978).

• Obesity secondary to medication
Some medications may lead to hyperphagia and weight gain, particularly antiepileptics and glucocorticoids.

• Sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise
Lack of exercise is a primary factor in the development of obesity: the prevalence of obesity
declines in proportion to the duration of daily exercise. It is not possible to establish whether
obesity is responsible for restricting exercise or whether the lack of exercise constitutes one of the
factors responsible for obesity (Robertson, 2003). The duration of daily exercise is a more precise
criteria than the type of habitat when evaluating energy expenditure.
Generally speaking, there are more obese animals among dogs living in an apartment than
among dogs living outdoors (31% versus 23%) (Robertson, 2003). Nevertheless, it would be a
mistake to believe that access to an open play space systematically increases energy expenditure.
Some animals that live in a confined environment walk for several hours a week, while others
that have access to a garden are content with a few minutes a day.

1 - Canine obesity

• Type of food
The following dietary habits have been clearly identified to contribute to obesity:
dietary intake that does not take account of the energy requirements (“the dog eats
everything it’s given”) and supplements in the form of treats or snacks not accounted for in the energy intake. Highly palatable food high in easily assimilated fats
and carbohydrates also predispose a dog to obesity. An undeniable risk factor is ad
libitum feeding leading to overconsumption of energy.
© Doxicat/Hermeline

Food can be highly palatable due to the presence of aromas or large quantities of fat.
Foods with the highest fat content are also those with the highest energy concentration.
Although it tolerates and utilizes fats as sources of energy, the dog is also able to immediately store them in the form of abdominal fats.
Altering the nutrient composition of a diet by an 8% increase in fat, without modifying the
total energy intake resulted in a significant increase in the deposition of abdominal fat without
modifying body weight in a group of bitches (Kim et al, 2003). In humans the fat intake is the
main determination in the development of obesity (Garaulet et al, 2001). In dogs, highly digestible food – low in dietary fiber and with a very high energy concentration – may also be responsible for weight gain. Various treats, leftovers and nutritional supplements are additional risk factors (Kienzle et al, 1998; Robertson, 2003).

Dachshund
Many small dogs spend the majority of their time
in the home. In Asia, 65% of small dogs have a
100% indoor lifestyle: these dogs do not go outside
and use a litter tray in the same way as a cat does.

There is disagreement about the influence of home-prepared diets on the development
of canine obesity (Lewis, 1978). The underlying idea is that the dogs that receive homeprepared rations will most often be compensated with treats and will receive
larger quantities of food. This can only be defended in countries where dogs continue
to be fed in the traditional way, with home-prepared rations or leftovers. In North
America, 95% of animals are given commercial food and yet canine obesity is at least
as widespread as in some European countries (Lund et al, 1999).

© Diez

An epidemiological study has not shown the particular influence of a type of food (wet
versus dry) on the frequency of obesity (Roberson, 2003).
Contrary to some preconceived ideas, dividing the daily diet into several meals does
not lead to an increase in the frequency of obesity. In epidemiological studies obese
dogs are generally fed once a day (Kienzle et al, 1998; Robertson, 2003). It is clearly
important not to confuse the division of the appropriate daily ration with the multiplication of the additional treats.

Female Auvergne Pointing Dog
Hypothyroidism is often associated
with obesity.

• Social aspect of the food

Among the sociological factors, a study conducted in Germany (Kienzle et al, 1998)
reported that the relationship between the human and the obese dog is characterized
by excessive anthropomorphical behavior. For example, owners of obese animals talk
to their dog more, allow their dog to lie on their bed, are not concerned about zoonoses and consider exercise, work and the protector function of their dog to be of minor
importance. So it is unsurprising that obese animals are given meals or treats more
often than animals of normal body weight. This study confirms that the owners are
often obese (54% versus 28% of owners of dogs of normal weight), as stated above
(Mason, 1970; Kronfeld, 1988) and fairly inactive. The owners of obese animals translate every appeal by the animal as being an appeal for food. These owners clearly have
little concern for balancing the diet.

The place of food in the relationship between the human and the dog plays a major
role in the development of obesity.

Ad libitum feeding must be advised against as most
dogs are unable to regulate their food consumption.

Obesity

Some of these aspects are very familiar to practitioners (Kienzle et al, 1998).
The data presented above may appear to be fairly discouraging at first glance and they do not clearly differentiate the simple correlation (between the weight of the owner and the weight of the
dog) and the causes of obesity. They are however, very useful for developing methods of preventing and treating canine obesity. They help focus attention on environmental factors in the wider
sense, at first glance external to the animal itself but of primary importance to the health of the
animal.
The owners of obese dogs may also interpret bulimia as a sign of good health (Kronfeld, 1988) and
excess weight as a sign of beauty in some breeds. Some owners also make the mistake of using
foods as a palliative treatment to prevent unmonitored animals from becoming bored or destroying
things. Lastly, for a dog living in a family environment, receiving food from children (as a reward
or in a game) can become a bad habit. Multiple pet households may pose problems with respect
to individual food consumption. Nevertheless, contrary to a predetermined idea, the frequency of
obesity is greater in households with only one dog (Kienzle et al, 1998; Robertson, 2003).
In conclusion, it appears that the energy requirements of dogs are often incorrectly estimated
and accordingly, in many situations energy intake can be excessive. It is up to the clinician to
determine whether the obesity is primary or secondary so as to establish the subsequent treatment.

Pathology associated with obesity
Until the end of the 1980s there was little clinical data on the conditions associated with obesity in dogs. Some epidemiological studies conducted on humans have been extrapolated to the
dog. However, the simple extrapolation of human data on diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc. to
dogs is not satisfactory. It is necessary to study clinical data on obese dogs. A survey is given in

> Reduction in longevity

It has been clearly shown that obesity leads to a reduction in the longevity of dogs. Kealy et al
(2002) followed a group of 48 Labradors, half of which received limited quantities of food throughout their life. From the start a group of dogs were fed ad libitum with a growth food and a second
group received 75% of the energy intake of the first group. The body weight of all the animals in
the ad libitum group as well as the group that received a lower energy intake, increased until age
3 years and 4 months, reaching the average values 35 kg and 27 kg respectively. At this point two
dietary modifications were introduced: a food with a lower energy concentration was
given to all dogs and the intake of the ad libitum group was restricted (provision of a
set quantity of food), while the second group continued to receive 25% less energy.

At age 12 years the average energy intake of the control group dogs and the dogs receiving 75% of intake were 1745 kcal and 1352 kcal (around 127 kcal/kg and 115 kcal/kg
of body weight (BW) 0.75) respectively. The dogs of the second group weighed on average 26% less than those of the control group. The dietary restriction helped prolong
longevity to 13 years rather than 11.2 years in the control group. The energy restriction helped slow down the development of chronic diseases and more specifically
arthrosis. Furthermore, different metabolic parameters (insulin, glucose, blood lipids)
were also favorably influenced in the dogs receiving 25% less energy. The above study
is extremely important in terms of its contribution to science: it confirms an undeniable
relationship between energy intake and longevity in dogs. It constitutes an argument
against ad libitum feeding and provides valuable data showing the consequences of obesity for the development of osteoarticular diseases.

The modification of the experimental protocol induced a reduction in the body weight
of all dogs, which was subsequently stabilized. At 5 years of age, the average difference between the two groups of dogs was 10 kg. At 8 years of age, the body index was
6.8/9 for the dogs eating the most food and 4.5/9 for the control group dogs (1: cachexia;
9 : massively obesity).

The food consumption of large-breed
puppies must be monitored from
a very early age.

Obesity

The positive effect of energy restriction on life expectancy has also been observed in humans.
Individuals presenting with an average body mass index live longer than overweight individuals
(Manson et al, 1987).
> Osteoarticular conditions

Obesity predisposes dogs of all ages to osteoarticular pathology (Figure 2 and Chapter 11). Obesity associated with over-consumption of food in large-breed puppies
during the growth phase leads to the development of various orthopedic complaints
or exaccerbated hip dysplasia (Kealy et al, 1992). The symptoms of osteoarticular
disease associated with obesity are generally observed after 6 months of age. In
many cases, the lesions are irreversible.
In the above study of Kealy et al, the radiological signs of osteoarthritis of the coxofemoral joint have been studied in Labradors from 4 months of age. They gradually became more common in the Labradors fed ad libitum compared with the dogs
whose energy consumption was limited (52% versus 13% at 5 years of age). In the
Labradors 8 years and over, the most common chronic disease was articular arthrosis affecting several joints (shoulder, elbow, hip, knee), with 90% of the Labradors
afflicted (Kealy et al, 1997, 2000, 2002). The study reported that the arthrosis was
more severe in the group initially fed ad libitum.

Other orthopedic conditions are common in obese dogs (Janicki & Sendecka, 1991).
Torn cruciate ligaments and fractures of the humeral condyle were the subject of a
wide epidemiological study on 854 Cocker Spaniels. The dogs afflicted with one of
two orthopedic complaints presented a body weight greater than that of the healthy population. Interestingly, the reverse was true of those dogs with disc disease
(Brown et al, 1996).
Hip dysplasia
Major dysplasic lesions at left with subluxation
and arthrosis. Obesity is a cause or an aggravator
of hip dysplasia. Energy restriction helps slow down
the appearance and development of the different
forms of osteoarthritis.

The dogs suffering from osteoarticular diseases are caught in a vicious circle: the
animal tends to reduce its activity, which leads to overfeeding and overweight if
the energy intake is not adjusted. Furthermore, the observation of an articular
condition (a torn cruciate ligament, for example) is certainly a major indication of
the need to reduce the dog’s weight, but it may also frustrate this process by making
exercise impossible.

Obesity

1 - Canine obesity

> Intolerance to effort and cardiorespiratory complaints

The principal symptoms associated with obesity are intolerance to effort (De Rick & De Schepper,
1980) and respiratory problems (Ettinger, 1983). There is also a link between the frequency of tracheal collapse and obesity, although the correlation with other factors, such as breed, is greater
(O'Brien et al, 1966; White & Williams, 1994).
A field study has shown that when weight loss is achieved, the owner inevitably observes a change in the dog’s behavior, whereby the dog is more alert and playful (unpublished Royal Canin data
2001, obtained on 13 dogs suffering from obesity for over a year and followed for at least 10
months).
The weight increase in the dog is accompanied by an increase in heart rhythm, ventricle volume,
blood pressure and plasma volume (Rocchini et al, 1987; Mizelle et al, 1994; Massabuau et al, 1997).
The correlation between obesity and hypertension is however, controversial. There was a link between age and the increase in arterial blood pressure in dogs, but not between obesity and hypertension (Bodey & Michell, 1996). Dogs have however been used in experiments to study the pathogenesis of hypertension induced by the increase in body weight and the associated insulin resistance (Verwaerde et al, 1997; Truett et al, 1998).
The frequency of cardiovascular diseases increases with obesity. Some clinical studies report
diseases including thrombosis of the portal vein (Van Winkle & Bruce, 1993), hypoxia of the myocardium (Baba & Arakana, 1984) and valvular endocarditis (Valtonen & Oksanen, 1972; Edney
& Smith, 1986).

The cardiovascular effects described above are also significant for nephrologists (Alonso-Galicia et al, 1995; Joles, 1998). Can hypertension lead to modifications in renal
function over time? A clinical study has shown that in dogs overfed for six
months with a diet rich in animal fat, weight gain (58% heavier than the
control group dogs) was accompanied by an increase in the weight of the
kidneys (31% heavier), an increase in arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow and various renal histological lesions.
The authors concluded that the lesions and the anomalies observed could be more severe in the case of prolonged obesity (Henegar et al, 2001). This study also suggested that the negative effects
may be due not only to the influence of dietary fats but also to the
composition of the fat.

Diabetic dogs may present with hyperphagia leading to weight gain at an early stage.
The correlations between obesity and glucose metabolism are complex, but it is clear
that obesity leads to profound changes in the metabolism of glucose and the secretion
of insulin (Mattheeuws et al, 1984a, b). It has been shown that the secretion of insulin, insulinemia and glucose intolerance increase proportionally to the degree of obesity. These changes are caused by a state of insulin resistance, one of the elements of
which is chronic inflammation (Festa et al, 2001). The model of the dog overfed with
a diet rich in fats has also been widely used to study the syndrome of insulin resistance.
Indeed, when the dog’s obesity is induced by feeding ad libitum with a diet rich in fats,
insulin resistance will gradually develop in relation to an increase in adiposity (Rocchini et al, 1987; Bailhache et al, 2003a; Kim et al, 2003) and an increase in the production of adipocyte cytokines (Gayet et al, 2002, 2003b, 2004a, b; Jeusette et al,
2004b).

> Diabetes mellitus

It has not been clearly established that obesity is a
risk factor in the development of diabetes mellitus
in dogs. Nevertheless, the current increase in the
incidence of diabetes mellitus in dogs could lead
to that supposition (Hoenig, 2002).

Obesity

> Reduction in immunity

Obese animals or animals fed a diet with a high fat content are less resistant to infection than animals fed a balanced diet (Newberne, 1966, 1973; Williams & Newberne, 1971; Fiser et al, 1972).
> Hyperlipidemia and dyslipidemia

According to Joshua (1970), fatty infiltration of the liver can be observed in obese dogs. An epidemiological study also shows that obesity increases the risk of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis
(Hess et al, 1999). Some results show profound disruptions to lipid metabolism. Obese dogs present with increased lipid plasma concentrations – cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids –
without exceeding the reference values for these parameters (Chikamune et al 1995; Bailhache et
al, 2003b; Diez et al, 2004). An increase in the contents of non-esterified fatty acids and lipoprotein modifications (increase in triglycerides in the VLDL and HDL, reduction in HDL cholesterol and increase in VLDL cholesterol) (Bailhache et al, 2003a, b) have also been observed. The
consequences of these well-known modifications in humans must however, still be evaluated in
dogs.
> Incontinence and urinary calculi

The hypothesis that there is a correlation between obesity and some forms of urinary incontinence, primarily in neutered bitches, has been suggested, but remains controversial (Gregory,
1994). Some bitches become incontinent after becoming obese and weight loss helps solve the
problem. In some cases, incontinence will be observed again in bitches that have regained weight
after losing it. One hypothesis that has been advanced is that the presence of retroperitoneal fat
can exercise mechanical effects on the bitch’s urinary system (Holt, 1987). The fact that neutered females are twice as likely to be obese compared with intact females must also be taken into
account. This could explain the correlation between urinary incontinence and neutering. The
debate is far from over.
Overweight dogs will also be more likely to develop urinary calcium oxalate calculi (Lekcharoensuk et al, 2000).
> Reproduction problems

The correlation between obesity and reproductive problems is not clear, although it is accepted
that excess fat may lead to dystocia (Edney & Smith, 1986; Sonnenschein et al, 1991; Glickman et
al, 1995).
> Cancers

The correlation between obesity and some cancers (breast, uterus, colon and prostate) is well established in humans (National Institute of Health, 1998). Conversely, the lack of clinical data means
such a link cannot be made in dogs with respect to anything but mammary tumors.
The first data were published in 1991. According to Sonnenschein et al, obesity or the consumption of a diet high in fat one year prior to the diagnosis does not increase the risk of mammary
cancer in adult bitches, neutered or intact. These results have been contradicted by Perez Alenza et al (1998, 2000).
On the other hand, the risk in neutered females was reduced in individuals that were slim between 9 and 12 months (Sonnenschein et al, 1991) and increased in females at the age of one year
(Perez Alenza, 1998, 2000). On the whole, the authors conclude that the condition of obesity in
juvenile animals certainly plays a role in the predisposition to mammary tumors in adulthood.
A retrospective study has not confirmed these results (Philibert et al, 2003). First of all, it was not
possible to analyze the effect of early onset obesity on the development of mammary tumors. Neither did the authors report any correlation between obesity and the development of tumors, or
16

Obesity

between obesity and the period of survival (10 months for obese bitches versus 14 months for
others).
> Dermatological disease

The many reviews that deal with canine obesity often mention that skin problems are more common in obese dogs than in healthy dogs. Paradoxically, to our knowledge there have been few studies to demonstrate this fact. In a clinical study on 29 dogs suffering from dermatitis due to Malassezia pachydermatis, obesity was identified as a significant risk factor for the development of this
dermatitis (Pak-Son et al, 1999).
According to Edney & Smith (1986), the correlation between skin problems and obesity is not
clear.
> Exploratory techniques

It is more difficult to use some exploratory techniques on obese dogs than on healthy dogs: auscultation, palpation or radiography are complicated by the excess subcutaneous or abdominal fat
(Joshua, 1970).
> Surgical inconvenience

The risks associated with anesthesia are greater in obese dogs, but vary depending on the type of
anesthetic used. The major risks are overdosing and lengthening of the period of recovery due to
the storage of lipid soluble anesthetics in body fat. The other risks are associated with concurrent
diseases that are common in obese patients, including circulatory, respiratory and hepatic problems (Clutton, 1988). In a controlled study on the surgical times in bitches undergoing ovariectomy, the surgical time was significantly – on average 30% – longer among obese bitches (Van
Goethem et al, 2003).
In obese humans the surgical risk is increased due to various anomalies such as disruptions of the
respiratory system, (reduction in respiratory capacity, hypoventilation), circulatory system (hypertension and cardiomegaly) or other functions (difficulties inserting tubes or maintaining water
balance). Post-surgical complications are also more common in obese patients (Fisher et al, 1975).

Obesity

> Modifications in thyroid function

Thyroid function has been explored in obese dogs in comparison
to a group of healthy dogs and in the course of a weight loss protocol. The concentrations of some thyroid hormones were higher
in obese dogs, and they decline during the weight loss protocol.
The authors concluded that obesity and the restriction of energy
alter thyroid function but that these modifications should not alter
the interpretation of clinical trials (Daminet et al, 2003).

REVERSIBILITY OF PROBLEMS
• Intolerance to effort, inactivity, orthopedic and respiratory problems
reported by owners are generally attenuated or may even disappear
completely after weight loss (Gentry, 1993; Diez et al, 2002, 2004).
• The same is true for some heart rhythm problems (Baba & Arakana,
1984).

Pathophysiology of obesity

• Urinary incontinence may also be reduced or disappear completely
after a diet (Holt, 1987).

In simple terms, obesity is the consequence of energy imbalance
where intake exceeds expenditure for a variable period of time,
which leads to a positive balance. There are a huge number of factors that can cause this situation and the interaction between
these factors rather than the action of any one of them is felt to
be responsible for obesity.

• Recent studies have shown the reversibility of the main metabolic
complaints, particularly insulin resistance and disruptions to lipid
metabolism (Gayet et al, 2003a, 2004a, b; Jeusette et al, 2004b).

> Energy balance

• The principles of energy balance
The fundamental principal of energy balance is:
Modifications of reserves = energy intake – energy expenditure
A positive energy balance is the consequence of energy intake exceeding expenditure, and conversely, the balance is negative when expenditure exceeds intake. In normal conditions the energy
balance oscillates meal after meal, day after day, week after week, without changing body weight
and energy reserves in the long term. Many physiological mechanisms play a role in adapting intake to expenditure and expenditure to intake so as to maintain a stable body weight in the long
term. If the energy balance is positive, expenditure increases (pointless cycles, uncoupling proteins, etc) and conversely, when the balance is negative, the body tends to reduce its expenditure (which contributes to the resistance to weight loss).

• Energy intake
The total energy intake provides all the food ingested, digested and metabolized by the body. Table
7 shows the energy intake via different nutrients that provide energy. The coefficients used are
derived from Atwater’s and involve some risk of error, since they take account of only average
digestibility. Fat provide more energy per unit of weight than digestible carbohydrate or protein.
In carnivores, dietary fiber is not very digestible and energy contribution is negligible. It should

• Energy expenditure
The second element in the equation is energy expenditure, which is split into three
parts:
- Basal metabolic rate (BMR)
- Postprandial thermogenesis (production of heat subsequent to the meal)
- Physical activity

1 - Canine obesity

however be noted that an energy value of 1-2 kcal/g is attributed to digestible fiber
in humans. In dogs, some soluble fiber is completely digested (Diez et al, 1998) and
acetate can contribute to 8% energy metabolism in the dog (Pouteau et al, 1998).

The most commonly used equation to calculate
the theoretical maintenance energy requirement is:
132 kcal per kg of metabolic weight (MW)*
* Where MW = (body weight) 0.73
This exponent is often rounded up to 0.75 to facilitate
calculations, but the original value is 0.73.

In sedentary human adults, basal metabolic rate, postprandial thermogenesis and
physical activity represent 60%, 10% and 30% of energy expenditure respectively
(WHO, 1997). The contribution of each of these factors varies significantly however, depending
on the regularity and intensity of the physical activity, which is the key variable in expenditure.
Basal metabolic rate appears, on the other hand, to be a stable individual factor, that has a major
impact on the amount of muscle mass of the organism (90-95% of energy expenditure of basal
metabolism versus 5-10% for fat mass).
In dogs, the basal metabolic rate also represents 55-70% of the total expenditure (NRC, 2006),
but differences have been observed between breeds. By way of example, the Labrador has a lower
basal metabolism rate than the Great Dane or the Spaniel. The basal metabolism rate declines
with age in dogs (Speakman et al, 2003). It is recommended to reduce the energy intake by 1015% from age 7, while adjusting the diet depending on the physical condition of the individual.
On the other hand, a low calorie diet is not always justified for all old dogs.
The necessary balance between intake and expenditure is the crux of the problem in dogs in general and in obese dogs in particular. The difficulties of estimating energy expenditure (requirements)
are multiple.

Breed can have a strong influence
on energy requirement, even between
two dogs of similar weight in similar
environmental conditions. When it comes
to theoretical rationing (NRC 1974),
it is wise to reduce the Newfoundland’s
ration by around 10%. The ration
of a Great Dane on the other hand must
often be increased by 40% to maintain
the dog’s weight.

First of all, the great diversity of the canine species: body weight varies between the extremes of
1 kg and over 100 kg. It is also easy to understand the difficulty of estimating the energy requirement of all the dogs with a simple equation. The average equation is 132 kcal/kg BW 0.75 (NRC,
1974). An initial approach proposed was to group breeds on the basis of their weight and size:
small, medium, large and giant.
Dogs of comparable weight and size in the same category may present very different energy requirements. The differences may be due to the thickness of the skin, the body composition (lean
mass/fat mass ratio) or to the type of selection used (originally a working dog, then selected on
beauty criteria and having the function of a companion animal). The body composition is extremely important: the dogs that present a great muscle mass expend more energy and are less susceptible to obesity than fat dogs.

© Royal Canin/Renner

Besides breed, individual factors, both genetic and otherwise, also generate great diversity in energy requirements. In dogs of the same breed of comparable weight, the males are generally a little
less fat than the females and so their expenditure is greater (on the order of 10%) however, this
is a controversial point (Kienzle & Rainbird, 1991).
As observed above, neutering will reduce expenditure (to the order of 20-30%) (Figure 3). Aging
of the animal is an example of a physiological condition that may reduce energy expenditure by
reducing the basal metabolic rate. Moreover, body composition changes during aging. The fat mass
tends to increase at the expense of the muscle mass.

Obesity

Energy expenditure associated with physical activity has not been quantified in dogs. From a practical perspective, it is not possible to say how many kilocalories correspond to an hour’s walking,
hunting or racing.

Four neutered Beagle bitches age 2 years received a standard maintenance food.
A 30% reduction in energy intake was necessary to maintain their body weight constant
for 26 weeks. After 26 weeks on a controlled diet the food was given ad libitum, leading
to an overconsumption of energy and a weight increase of 22% above their initial weight
(16.7 kg versus 13.7 kg). (There was no control group)

In a neutral thermal environment, the energy expenditure associated with the thermoregulation
of dogs living indoors is low. The seasonal effect is accordingly negligible. On the other hand, to
maintain thermoregulation the energy expenditure of dogs kept in an outdoor kennel increases
when the ambient temperature falls. In the literature however, the quantification of supplementary energy expenditure is controversial. In the German Shepherd for example, a variation of 1°C
is accompanied by a variation in the energy requirement of the order of 1% (Manner, 1991). Other
data show an increase from 2.3 up to 3.8% per degree below the thermal neutrality zone (NRC,
2006).
To conclude, the estimation of the energy requirement is not easy in dogs. While there is a large
quantity of data, the data is fragmented and it is difficult to generalize. In practical terms, monitoring weight and knowing what the dog needs to consume to maintain a constant weight are the
most important pieces of energy-requirement-based information for any given individual.
> The physiological regulation of body weight

In their original habitat, wild canids are generally active and in an environment with abundant
food it is extremely rare for adult animals to be obese. The biological mechanisms regulating body
weight are present throughout the animal kingdom and appear to be fairly efficient in combating
underconsumption.

20

Obesity

1 - Canine obesity

In domesticated animals, the environmental pressure makes the mechanisms likely to manage
overconsumption more useful. The hormonal regulators of appetite, food consumption and energy expenditure are becoming more and more well-known, particularly leptin, ghrelin and adiponectin.
Leptin is a cytokine produced and secreted by the fat cells. It acts as an energy balance modulator signal, both centrally (on the hypothalamus) and peripherally (liver, pancreas, etc). Leptin
accordingly appears to play a key role in the regulation of food consumption. At the time of its
discovery leptin was presented as a miracle treatment for obesity as leptin injections in obese and
healthy mice induced significant body weight loss without any apparent side effects. Nevertheless, it has been shown that obese humans and dogs (Ishioka et al, 2002; Gayet et al, 2003a; Jeusette et al, 2003, 2004b) do not suffer from leptin deficiency. On the contrary, in these two species, leptin is produced in proportion to the quantity of fat cells such that the rates of plasma leptin are higher in obese individuals than in healthy individuals. Leptin increases energy expenditure in healthy individuals but in obese individuals the situation is less clear due to a resistance
phenomenon.
On the other hand, it appears that insulin and many other mediators also play a role in regulating leptin (Lonnqvist et al, 1999). Clinical studies conducted on humans tend to show that the
blood concentration of leptin is dependent on the secretion of insulin, the composition of the
food and exercise (Koutsari et al, 2003). From a practical perspective, the main point to remember with respect to obesity is that leptin reduces the appetite. Leptinemia increases in dogs during
periods of weight gain (Gayet et al, 2003a, 2004b; Jeusette et al, 2004b).
Ghrelin (GH releasing hormone) has been identified by Kojima et al (1999). It stimulates the
secretion of growth hormone (GH) and increases food ingestion in humans and rodents. We have
observed that the plasma concentration of ghrelin is lower in obese dogs than it is in healthy animals (Jeusette et al, 2003, 2004b).

• Leptin is a protein that increases energy
expenditure in healthy individuals.
• Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone principally
secreted by the stomach and the duodenum.
• Adiponectin acts in synergy with leptin.
It is secreted by adipose tissue.

Adiponectin is a cytokine secreted exclusively by the adipose tissue. It affects carbohydrate
homeostasis, sensitivity to insulin and probably energy homeostasis. It will act in synergy with leptin (Yamauchi et al, 2001). Its expression is reduced in obese and diabetic mice (Hu et al, 1996).
It is also reduced by half in obese dogs compared with healthy dogs (Gayet et al, 2004b).
Additional regulatory factors include TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor). This cytokine was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory molecule that participates in anorexia and cancer cachexia. It
has been found in particularly high quantities in the adipose tissue of obese animals and patients.
The expression and the concentrations of TNF-α are positively correlated to the degree of obesity and the resistance to insulin (Hotamisligil et al, 1995) as shown in dogs (Gayet et al, 2004a).
Besides the mechanisms mentioned above, the activity of uncoupling proteins (UCP) deserves
emphasis. These proteins belong to a family of transporters in the internal membrane of the mitochondria, which uncouple the respiration of ATP synthesis by dispersing the mitochondrial proton gradient. The activity of these proteins varies according to thermoregulation and postprandial thermogenesis. The expression of UCP-1 is greatly reduced in the adipose tissue of obese,
insulin-resistant dogs (Leray et al, 2003).
To conclude, it appears that many factors involved in the development of obesity in humans
and rodents have also been identified in dogs, whether they are factors limiting appetite or factors increasing expenditure.

Obesity

> The dynamics of weight gain

© Faculty of veterinarian of Liège

Despite these regulator mechanisms, a positive energy balance can induce weight gain
if it continues for a long enough period of time. There is controversy as to the period
of imbalance (energy intake greater than expenditure). In humans the perceived hypothesis is that obesity is established slowly, following a prolonged imbalance (several
years) that does not have to be sizeable. Clinicians distinguish three phases:
- A pre-obesity static phase during which the individual’s energy intake is increased
but its weight remains the same
From a certain phase of obesity the food
consumption may decline without the dog
losing weight, because the basal metabolic
rate is relatively low.

- A dynamic phase, during which the individual gains weight, primarily increasing its
fat mass but also its non-fat mass, if only by a low increase in the blood volume

- A static phase during which the balance between intake and expenditure is reestablished due to the reduction in food consumption. In this phase, the weight is
extremely high, but the basal metabolic rate is relatively low. In this new state of balance obesity
is usually considered to be morbid (WHO, 1997).

These data can almost be extrapolated to companion dogs, after a few adjustments. With respect
to the period of imbalance, the data must be adapted to the life expectancy of the dog and practical observations must be taken into account. Weight gain can occur rapidly, in a few weeks or
months. Rapid weight gain may occur in the weeks following the neutering of bitches. Ad libitum
feeding during growth may induce major weight gain in puppies aged 8 months.
The pre-obesity phase has not been described in dogs. The dynamic and static phases on the other
hand have been well documented (Figure 4). The dynamic phase may be linear or segmented.
Weight is stabilized during the static phase; appetite may be normal or diminished. This explains
why it is common to see obese dogs in the clinic that “do not eat a lot.” What is clear is that the
energy intake was greater than the dog’s needs at a given moment in its life – sometimes several
years earlier. But once these animals have been stabilized, their energy requirements are low and
physical activity is often very limited, the more so at this stage.
> Quality of dietary intake

Various studies conducted on humans and laboratory animals show that dietary factors, particularly energy intake and fat content, are directly correlated to obesity.

1 - Canine obesity

• Energy intake and macro-nutrients
For dogs, the calculation of the energy provided by a food is based on its chemical composition.
Fats are the nutrients that contain the most energy. The over-consumption of fatty food is accordingly an essential factor in the genesis of obesity. Fat is added to food to both increase palatability and the energy density of the diet.
In terms of metabolizable energy, the protein and carbohydrate intake is equal. When the net
energy intake is calculated however, the utilization of proteins for energy is lower (Table 7) (Rubner, 1902). This is one of the reasons, other than the specific effect of some amino acids (lysine,
phenylalanine, leucine), for proteins having more of a satisfying effect than carbohydrates. The
carnivorous nature of dogs may explain to some degree the resistance of wild canids to obesity.
Digestible carbohydrates clearly provide the same quantity of energy, but they induce different
metabolic effects, particularly on the secretion of insulin. This point is addressed in more detail
below.
From a theoretical perspective, it can be accepted that the mathematical adaptation of energy
intake to energy expenditure suffices to prevent canine obesity. But this will be disregarded in some
cases, because it is based on ‘metabolizable energy.’ The simple modification of the food’s chemical composition – without modifying the total energy intake – can lead to changes to the body
composition and the basal metabolic rate. This point has been proven in dogs and is well established in human nutrition (Bouché et al, 2002).

Diagnosis and evaluation of obesity
One of the major tasks facing the clinician is to evaluate how obese the animal is as in many cases
the optimal body weight is unknown. In human medicine, it is easy to calculate an optimal weight
range based on size, using the BMI (body mass index), which is the ratio of height to weight. In
human medicine, doctors have a BMI reference table they can consult. These tables are not available for domesticated carnivores. Various attempts at morphometric measurement have proved
inconclusive due to the great diversity of canines breeds. Other less standardized tools have accordingly been proposed for veterinary medicine.
> Body weight

The simplest method is the body weight reference. It is easy to weigh a dog, but weight
alone is not enough to evaluate obesity. Without an indication of the dog’s ideal weight
this data is of little use. While it is easy to use breed standards as a reference for purebred dogs, this method is not completely satisfactory, because the animal’s body weight
can vary quite significantly depending on its stature (Table 8).
When visiting the veterinarian it is important that the dog is weighed and its medical
file is updated accordingly. The ideal weight must be identified or estimated to ascertain an obese animal’s diet. This is the most important factor in formulating a diet that
will enable the dog to lose weight.
> Morphometric measures

The combination of data on stature and on body weight introduces the concept of morphometric techniques to evaluate body composition. Morphometry measures the outer
form, evaluates certain body regions and how their dimensions change and shows their
relationship to modifications in body composition. The morphometric techniques used
on dogs are body condition scoring and techniques that combine diverse body parameter measurements (length and circumference of various parts of the body).

A massive deposit of adipose tissue on the spinal
column and the base of the tail are among
the criteria used to identify obesity.

The body index is a semi-quantitative subjective evaluation method combining the evaluation of visible characteristics and palpation of certain
regions of the body. This evaluation is conducted in accordance with simple
criteria: the size and location of major adipose deposits, the visible and invisible skeletal structure, and the silhouette of the animal.

© I. Jeusette

Several types of index have been proposed:
- 3 grades: 1 = slim, 2 = optimal, 3 = excessive
- 5 grades: 1 = gaunt, 2 = slim, 3 = optimal, 4 = overweight, 5 = obese (Edney
& Smith, 1986) (Table 9)
- and even 9 grades: 1-4 = emaciated to slim; 5 = optimal; 6-9 increasingly
overweight (Laflamme, 1993; Laflamme et al, 1994a).

© I. Jeusette

The animals presenting an average index corresponding to an optimal
weight have a fat mass of around 13%. When a 9-grade body index is used,
every grade in the index represents a 9%-increase in fat mass (Mawby et al,
2000). As a consequence, an animal presenting a body index of 9, which
corresponds to the qualification ‘morbid obesity,’ has a fatty mass of over
40%. The advantage of these index systems is that they can be easily applied
by the clinician and that they do not apply exclusively to the diagnosis of
obesity but also to its active prevention. It is easy to weigh the animal during
a routine consultation and find the value in the index.

The transition from a 5grade scale to a 9-grade
scale is easily accomplished
by applying intermediate
graduations in the 5-grade
scale. Here, the body index
of this Beagle bitch can
be 4.5/5 or 8/9.

Each half-grade above grade 3 represents an increase in weight of 10%.
So a dog graded 4.5 presents 30% overweight.

1 - Canine obesity

Obesity

The measures of the various circumferences – thoracic and pelvic for example – and their use in
the equation systems do not enable any appreciation of the fat mass due to morphological differences between individuals. They are however a good way of monitoring the weight loss in a given
dog. The various body measures do require experience from the practitioner, as well as the cooperation of the animal (Burkholder, 2000).
> Ultrasound measurements

Ultrasound has been used to measure the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer in dogs (Anderson & Corbin, 1982; Morooka et al, 2001). Combining this technology with others may be a good
way to localize the main fat deposits and understand the mechanisms that drive the development
of obesity (Morooka et al, 2001). Furthermore, this technology is relatively simple and non-invasive; it is useful in the clinic provided good equipment is available. Its field of application is narrow however – it can only be used to evaluate subcutaneous fat. Several body regions have been
tested, including the middle of the lumbar region and the L6 and L7 lumber or S1 sacral apophyses. The problem is reproductibility: it is necessary to shave the hair, standardize the animal’s
position and the pressure of the sound probe, and use objective benchmarks. The use of ultrasound
in two dimensions helps improve the technique and obtain more precise figures (Morooka et al,
2001).
> DEXA

The use of DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) (Munday et al, 1994) is a way of differentiating between the nature and the quantity of each tissue in the parts of the organism
subjected to examination and to monitor the development of the dog’s body composition during
the period of weight loss. This examination requires that the animal is anesthetized for the procedure. The results relate to the bone mineral mass, adipose tissue and lean mass of the organism
(Figure 5).

Body water is primarily stored in lean tissue; as a consequence, it is an indirect measure of lean mass. The quantity of total body water can be estimated by establishing
the dilution of deuterium oxide (D2O) or of water enriched with O18. The fat mass
and its percentage can be calculated on the basis of the difference. Deuterium and
O18 are two excellent non-radioactive and non-toxic tracers at low doses. This
method requires a blood sample before the subcutaneous injection of the tracer and
a second blood sample four or five hours post injection. It can be used in practice to
estimate the percentage of fat tissue in obese dogs, provided there is access to mass
spectrometry. This non-invasive method has been validated in dogs (Pouteau et al.
1998; Son et al, 1998).

The weight loss is spread between 87% fat mass (7.7 kg in all) and 13%
lean mass (1.12 kg in all). Final fat mass is still high (35%), but compatible
with the breed of the dog.

> Bioelectric impedance

In humans, the measurement of bioelectric impedance is a fast and simple non-invasive method
for studying the body composition that is both portable and reproducible. The method has been
tested on cats and dogs (Elliott et al, 2002a, 2002b).
These three methods – which have only recently been used on carnivores – produce well correlated results (Son et al, 1998). They are certainly more applicable to research settings than
to clinical situations, but nevertheless, they do open interesting perspectives for comparing the
efficacy of different low energy foods available in the marketplace (Diez et al, 2002).

2 - Treatments for obese animals
Pharmacological treatments
A large pharmacological arsenal has been developed to treat human obesity. It should be noted
that some of these pharmaceuticals have been developed for dogs. Some studies have been conducted with these agents to reduce the body weight of obese dogs (Bomson & Parker, 1975). These
trials have not been successful.
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) administered at a large dose (60 mg/kg of body weight /day)
reduces the deposition of fatty tissue and has been used as an agent to facilitate weight loss, in
combination with a low-energy diet in obese dogs (MacEwen & Kurzman, 1991; Kurzman et al,
1998). DHEA also exhibits hypolipemic and hypoglycemic properties. Its mechanism of action
has yet to be fully clarified. Due to the many uncertainties as to the various effects of this hormonal precursor, its utilization in dogs can not be recommended at this time.
Injections of human recombinant leptin have also been used in dogs. The administration of leptin to healthy or obese dogs induced a significant loss of weight proportional to the duration and
the dose used. Weight loss is nevertheless greater in healthy dogs. The dogs start to gain weight a
week after the end of the treatment, gradually returning to their initial weight. The weight loss is
essentially due to a reduction in body fat mass. In a study comparing the effects of leptin administration in obese males and females, a similar loss of weight was observed in the two groups at
doses of 0.5 mg/kg BW/d and 5.0 mg/kg BW/d (Lebel et al, 1999). This type of specific trial does
not argue in favor of the use of leptin in obese dogs, especially due to the lack of long-term data
and the presence of the rebound effect after the end of the treatment.
Whatever place pharmacological treatment will have in the future, it should not be forgotten that
in a global approach (behavioral and dietary) of obese dogs, medication should never be used as
it does not change the owner’s behavior.

Surgical treatments
In human medicine various surgical interventions help limit food consumption. These techniques
are not used on animals at this time.

Approach of the owner
The psychological approach of the owner is essential. The objective is to motivate the owner by
explaining the causes and the damage caused by obesity as well as the advantages of having a healthy animal. Clear explanations, regular checkups and the establishment of a weight curve are steps
that will contribute to successful treatment (Lewis et al, 1987; Norris & Beaver, 1993). No diet is
possible without the cooperation of the owner.

27

2 - Treatments for obese animals

Obesity

Clinical trials conducted on obese dogs provide various findings. The first is that in a weight loss
program initiated by the owner, over 50% of those owners did not return for checkup visits. It
must therefore be concluded that over 50% of dog owners abandon the diet in the month following the first visit (Remillard, 2000). In another study, 75% of dogs registered stopped losing weight
(Gentry, 1993). These details will be addressed from a more practical perspective under Clinical
Food.

Nutritional treatment
Two techniques can be used to reduce the dog’s weight. Fasting is applicable and effective provided the animal does not present with a concomitant pathology like hepatic insufficiency or diabetes mellitus. It is necessary to hospitalize the animal and to give it daily mineral and vitamin
supplements. Many authors have shown that the dog can easily bear complete nutritional privation (De Bruijne & Lubberink, 1977; Brady & Armstrong, 1977), but according to Abel et al (1979)
prolonged fasting past 36 days can lead to heart lesions. Furthermore, this method is not to be
recommended for ethical reasons and because it does not bind the owner to long-term dietary
modifications.
The restriction of energy intake is accordingly the only truly valid option. The dietary balance must be established with the owner. In the absence of precise information on the quantities of
food ingested, it should be possible to estimate the total daily energy typically consumed by the
animal. A very strict protocol must then be established with the owner’s full cooperation.
> Level of energy restriction

The choice of the ration’s energy level depends on several criteria, including the degree of weight
excess, the animal’s sex and the projected duration of the diet. The first step consists of defining
the ideal weight; the second is setting the energy restriction level. The diet is generally calculated to provide 40% – a very severe restriction – (Markwell et al, 1990) to 60% (Edney, 1974) or
75% (Dzanis, 2000) of the energy needed to maintain the optimal weight. Table 10 provides an

overview of the various clinical and experimental trials. Theoretically, the higher the energy restriction, the shorter the restriction period needed.
The practitioner may be tempted to opt for very severe energy restriction to limit the duration of
the diet. This is not recommended. Too severe a restriction may lead to a significant feeling of
hunger in the animal, generating an augmentation of activity after meals (Crowell-Davis et al,
1995b) and consequently the dissatisfaction of the owner and a lack of cooperation with respect
to following a strict diet. The diet runs the risk of being abandoned after a few weeks or even a
few days. Additionally, the loss of muscle mass can also be exaggerated by a sudden loss of weight,
as has been shown in humans (Pasanisi et al, 2001). In experimental conditions, the rebound effect
(weight gain after the end of the diet) is so much more intense and fast when the energy restriction is severe (Laflamme & Kuhlman, 1995). The explanation advanced for the severity of the
rebound effect is that the dogs present a reduction of metabolic activity associated with an increase in energy efficiency during the diet. The more severe the energy restriction, the less the physical activity is of the dog (Crowell-Davis et al, 1995a). This reduction in activity constitutes a
second risk factor for muscle mass loss.
Lastly, the long-term modification of the owner’s behavior is more desirable than a rapid change.
As a consequence, a very severe energy restriction is not recommended for all animals, but should
be reserved for the most severe cases of obesity, when the weight gain is more than 40% and there
is a medical indication for rapid loss, such as serious respiratory, cardiac or orthopedic problems.
The same applies if the animal has to undergo anesthesia in the short or medium term.
Various experimental and clinical trials show that a reasonable objective is to maintain a loss of
1-2% of the initial (obese) weight per week, or 4-8% per month. There is a wide consensus on
this degree of weight loss. Table 11 proposes various degrees of energy restriction based on several parameters: body weight excess, sex and desired weight loss period.

To initiate weight loss without imposing too severe a restriction immediately, the recommended initial energy allocation is:
- 65% (or 85 kcal/kg IBW0.75) of the maintenance energy requirement for a male, falling to 55% (or 75 kcal/kg IBW0.75) if the dog is neutered.
- 60 % (or 80 kcal/kg IBW0.75) of the maintenance energy requirement for a female, falling to 50% (or 65 kcal/kg IBW0.75) if the bitch is
neutered.
These options can be subsequently revised depending on the period of weight loss.

Obesity

> Differences between males and females

© I. Jeusette

A study conducted on Beagles showed that it was more difficult to induce and maintain the weight loss in obese females – neutered or unneutered – than in neutered
males. The initial degree of obesity was comparable, as was the weekly loss of weight.

For weight loss of 1.5% per week, at least
3.5-4 months are needed to change
a body score from 7/9 to 5/9
(or from 4/5 to 3/5).

In the course of time, the adjustments to the quantities were more severe for the
females compared with the male dogs. For female dogs, an energy intake limited to
54% of the calculated maintenance energy need based on the ideal weight did not
lead to the attainment of the target weight. The 60% level used at this time appears
to be inappropriate for females. The development of body composition was not affected by sex (Diez et al, 2002). The maintenance food of obese dogs needs to be examined to understand this difference between the sexes. At comparable weight, obese
bitches consume an average 15% less energy than males by unit of ideal metabolic
weight and their lean mass is generally inferior. It is therefore illogical to apply the
same weight-loss protocol to individuals of different sexes (Jeusette et al, 2004c).

> Modification of the food

It is totally contraindicated to achieve energy restriction by simply reducing the quantity of the
food typically consumed. This will lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients and will have little
probability of success. An animal that is denied food may develop unpleasant behavior: nervousness, theft of food and sometimes even aggression (Branam, 1988). These behaviors discourage
the owner and the diet will be highly unlikely to succeed. Crowell-Davis et al (1995a) relate the
effects of the restriction on the behavior of a group of dogs in the kennel: during the first few days
of calorie restriction the animals showed a greater propensity to chew objects, heightened aggression among some subjects and an increase in the frequency of barking. The selection of a food
specially adapted for weight loss is therefore imperative if deficiencies are to be avoided and the
dog is to receive sufficient food, while simultaneously limiting energy intake.
> Low-calorie foods

There are various ways to reduce the concentration or energy density of commercial dog food.
The simplest way of effectively reducing the energy concentration of a commercial food is to reduce the fat content and increase the dietary fiber content. These two major changes are indeed
essential, but all nutrients (amino acids, fatty acids, minerals and vitamins) must be given due
consideration in the formulation of a food, as described in more detail below.
In addition, it should be noted that the production of extruded dry food containing large quantities of air will help increase the volume of the ration. This method mainly has a psychological
impact on the owner and less on the dog, since the weight of the daily ration is reduced. The
change in the size, texture and shape of the kibble may be a way to increase the ingestion time
and satiating power. In the case of wet food, very high hydration (over 80% water) also helps
maintain a relatively large volume. Nevertheless, the impact on satiation is dubious, as the water
– or the liquid fraction of the food – is evacuated from the stomach in 20-30 minutes depending
on the size of the particles. The addition of viscous dietary fiber that binds water does on the other
hand slow down gastric emptying (Russell & Bass, 1985).

• The essential nutrient content of low-calorie foods is extremely important. A
more or less severe restriction imposed on an animal must never be accompanied by any deficiencies of proteins, essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, minerals, vitamins or trace elements.

30

Obesity

2 - Treatments for obese animals

• The protein concentration of low-calorie foods must be greater than those of
maintenance foods to provide the essential amino acids. Figure 6 illustrates the necessity of increasing the protein content in the food to avoid the energy restriction causing a protein deficiency.
The same reasoning is valid for all essential nutrients. High-protein diets have been used successfully for several years in humans and have demonstrated many benefits.

To provide the animal with the same daily
quantity of proteins (in the example,
50 g), the crude protein concentrations
of the low-energy food must be increased to
83 g, 100 g or 125 g per 1000 kilocalories
respectively, depending on whether 60%,
50% or 40% of energy is provided to
maintain the ideal weight.

Energy allocation based on the maintenance energy requirement (MER)

- Positive effect on body composition by maintaining lean tissue mass. High-protein diets minimize muscle wasting and facilitate the loss of fat (Durrant et al, 1980; Piatti et al, 1994).These
effects have also been observed in dogs as part of a low-calorie diet. Three similar diets differing
in protein concentration (20%, 30% and 39% of energy intake) were fed to 42 obese dogs. The
diet with the highest protein content led to increased loss of fat mass and minimized the loss of
lean tissue (Hannah, 1999). These results have been confirmed in another trial comparing two
low-energy diets. The high-protein diet contained 157 g of protein/1000 kcal or 47.5% of dry matter (Diez et al, 2002).
- Lower yield in terms of net energy intake for proteins compared with carbohydrates. At the
same weight, digestible carbohydrates and proteins provide comparable levels of metabolizable
energy, but proteins provide lower net energy levels (Rubner, 1902). This means that the use of
proteins costs the organism energy. The energy expended is accordingly not stored in the form of
fat, which is advantageous for obese individuals.
- Satietogenic power of proteins (Louis-Sylvestre, 2002): the increase in the prevalence of obesity has fueled interest in foods with a strong satiating power. The results of many studies conducted on humans have shown that the absorption following the consumption of high-protein foods
was lower than after consumption of foods with a high carbohydrate or fat content. The amino
acids from the digestion of proteins are absorbed slowly and the main path of their metabolism is
gluconeogenesis. Therefore, proteins are sources of glucose that induce little insulin secretion and
they slow down the appearance of hypoglycemia, which contributes to the feeling of hunger. The
speed of digestion varies from one protein to the other and amino acids induce the secretion of
insulin to varying degrees, so the satietogenic power may also differ from one protein to another.
This certainly merits studies specific to the dog.

Obesity

- Beneficial effect on palatability. This property is particularly significant when using low-calorie
foods.
- Improved conservation of weight loss after the diet. This effect has been shown in humans
(Westerterp- Plantenga et al, 2004).
The quality of the protein is also important. It is necessary to increase the protein content of the
ration when significant quantities of mixed dietary fiber (association of soluble and insoluble fiber)
are added, due to the reduction in the digestibility of the dry matter (DM) (including the protein)
caused by some fiber.

• The fat content of low-calorie foods is generally reduced to less than 25% of energy
intake. Nevertheless, a minimal fat concentration is necessary to ensure the intake of essential
fatty acids and the transport of fat soluble vitamins. The most recent recommendations are at least
5.5% of DM (for a food containing 4000 kcal/kg of DM, or 14 g/1000 kcal). Low-calorie commercial foods never contain less than 5% of fat. In addition, the choice of fat sources of different origins (vegetable oil, linseed oil or fish oil) ensures the intake of essential long-chain fatty acids.
• The use of dietary fiber has fueled a wide debate in both human and animal nutrition. The incorporation of fiber is not universal rather it is one of many approaches (Diez &
Nguyen, 2003). Fiber can be advantageous for the nutritional management of obesity in dogs.

Dietary fibers, in purified form
or in high-fiber food like vegetables or
whole-grain cereals, have a universally
acknowledged satietogenic effect
in humans, but they may lead
to gastro-intestinal problems, such
as flatulence and diarrhea.

- Fiber is generally a dilution element and allows a reduction in the energy density of a food. A
standard dry maintenance food has an energy concentration of 3500- 4000 kcal per kg of DM,
but several authors (Lewis, 1978; Hand, 1988) advocate a low energy concentration. It is however difficult to formulate a food with an energy concentration lower than 2800 kcal/kg of DM.
- Soluble fiber slows down gastric emptying and induces slower absorption of nutrients in dogs
(Russel & Bass, 1985).
- Insoluble fiber acts as a bulking agent, increasing the volume of the food and accelerating dietary transit (Burrows et al, 1982; Fahey et al, 1990).

- Fiber leads to a feeling of satiation: a diet containing
at least 20% total dietary fiber (Total Dietary Fiber
(TDF); Prosky et al, 1994) reduces the voluntary
energy intake in dogs (Jewell et al, 2000).

- Fiber increases the quantity of feces and the frequency of defecation (a general effect of dietary
fiber)
- Fiber causes a reduction in the digestibility of certain
nutrients like proteins and minerals, which demand
their incorporation in greater quantities
- Fiber adversely affects palatability (Meyer et al,
1978), which can be easily corrected by the addition
of palatability factors
- Fiber may lead to gastro-intestinal problems, such as
flatulence and diarrhea.

> Fiber and chemical analysis

The preferred method for measuring any dietary
fiber (soluble and insoluble) is to measure the
enzymes in the total dietary fiber. This is the only
way to acquire significant nutritional information.
The difference between crude fiber and total dietary fiber is much greater than in food containing
more mixed fiber or soluble fiber content. Table 12
for example shows that in the case of cereals, the
ratio of the two values is 1 to 4. At the extreme, a
food containing significant quantities of soluble
(non-cellulose) fiber will have negligible crude cellulose content.

From a legal perspective, the fiber content shown
on pet food labels is crude cellulose (also known as
crude fiber). This fiber content arises from an analytical method that does not fully reflect the actual
fiber content of the food. A chemical analysis of the
crude cellulose only measures part of the insoluble
fiber, primarily the cellulose and some hemicelluloses (Figures 7A & B). Yet other types of fiber are
also used by the pet food industry including soluble
fiber (psyllium, guar gum), and mixed fiber (mixtures of soluble and insoluble fibers).

2 - Treatments for obese animals

Obesity

> Fiber and satiety

In obese humans undergoing low-calorie diets the ingestion of a daily supplement of insoluble fiber
(Ryttig et al, 1989; Astrup et al, 1990), soluble fiber (Krotkiewski, 1984; Di Lorenzo et al, 1988) or
mixed fiber (Burley et al, 1993) induces better satiety or reduces the feeling of hunger.
It is much more difficult to evaluate the feeling of satiety in dogs than it is in humans. Various
indirect methods are used to evaluate satiety, by measuring ingestion or the speed of gastric emptying. In the case of the latter, it is postulated that the distention of the stomach inhibits the physiological mechanisms leading to ingestion and as a consequence acts as a signal of satiety (Jewell
et al, 1996, 2000). However, the methodology for measuring gastric emptying in dogs has not been
widely standardized. The repeated measurements in the hours following the meal necessitate
manipulation of the animal that may slow down gastric emptying.
Butterwick et al (1994) reported that the addition of insoluble fiber in moderate concentrations
did not have any affect on ingestion in dogs. A group of dogs presenting 15% overweight were
given a food rich in various types of dietary fiber (from 6.6% TDF for the control group to 15.6%
TDF of DM). The quantities of food were calculated to cover 40% of the energy requirements for
maintaining optimal weight, which corresponds to severe energy restriction. Three hours after the
main meal, a highly palatable second meal (wet food) was made available to the animals for 15
minutes; consumption was then measured. The trial was conducted twice in a 12-day period. The
quantities consumed during the second meal were comparable for the different groups (Butterwick
et al, 1994). It is nevertheless difficult to draw any conclusion from these results as the control
diet contained 6.7% TDF and the effect of the severe energy restriction had to dominate with respect to the dietary fiber. Lastly, it must be noted that most of the dogs are unable to control their
consumption when they are given a highly palatable food.
> Fiber and its effect on weight and body composition

Energy restriction associated with the provision of a high-fiber, low-fat diet (23% and 9% DM respectively) leads to a greater reduction in body fat mass and blood cholesterol concentrations, in
comparison to a high-fat, low-fiber diet (Wolfsheimer et al, 1994a). The reduction in body weight
and blood pressure are also greater in the case of the former, although the differences are not significant (Borne et al, 1996). The two diets provide 35% of metabolizable energy in the form of protein, which is around 10% higher than a maintenance diet. The use of DEXA has made it possible to collect evidence of modifications in body composition following low-calorie diets,
although the weight losses are statistically comparable. Nevertheless, conclusions should be carefully considered because the effects of the two parameters (fat content and fiber content) are
confounding in this study. Furthermore, low-fat diets that are not supplemented with fiber produce the same effects in rats (Boozer et al, 1993).
In humans, spontaneous loss of body weight (Krotkiewski, 1984) and body fat (Raben et al, 1995)
has also been reported following the ingestion of soluble or insoluble fiber in obese and non-obese
patients. Furthermore, the addition of a supplement of insoluble (Solum et al, 1987; Ryttig et al,
1989) or mixed fiber (Godi et al, 1992) produces a greater reduction in weight in obese patients
subjected to moderate energy restriction (1200 kcal/day), compared with a control diet.
The results of the studies reported above suggest that dietary fiber plays a beneficial role in the
weight loss of obese patients. The effects of fiber are summarized in Tables 13A &B.
> Carbohydrates

The content and quality of the digestible carbohydrates – primarily starch – of low-calorie diets
has also been the subject of some studies. In human food, the concept of the glycemic index (GI)
was developed by Jenkins et al (1981) as a means of predicting the glycemic response following

34

Obesity

2 - Treatments for obese animals

the ingestion of food containing established quantities of carbohydrates. The GI of a food is defined as the ratio (in %) of the glycemic response following the ingestion of a 50 g portion of digestible carbohydrates to the response after ingestion by the same individual of a 50 g portion of starch in the form of white bread.

2 - Treatments for obese animals

Obesity

The GI is a concept utilized in the dietetic treatment of diabetic patients and in some diets (including the Montignac diet) that confirms the utility of sources of non-refined cereals or dietary fiber
(Wolever & Jenkins, 1986). The GI is controversial however, because individual responses can be
variable and the development of glycemia after a complete meal is different from the changes induced by the absorption of a single type of carbohydrate (Jenkins et al, 1988). Nevertheless, it would
appear that the consumption of non-refined cereals plays a part in the prevention of human obesity, especially by acting on the hormonal regulators of obesity (Koh-Banerjee & Rimm, 2003).
The application of this concept in diets for diabetic or obese dogs is fairly logical. The principle
is to use sources of starch that stimulate the production of insulin only to a limited degree. This
limits the storage of energy in the form of triglycerides in the adipocytes. The complete food that
limits glucose production does not stimulate the production of insulin – a lipotrope hormone – as
much. From a practical perspective, white rice is not recommended as a main cereal in low-calorie foods, whereas barley and corn constitute the best sources of energy (Sunvold & Bouchard,1998)
(Figure 8).
> Minerals, vitamins and trace elements

The mineral, vitamin and trace element concentrations of low-calorie foods must be higher than
those in maintenance foods, similar to protein. Restricting energy intake and the quantities given
must not lead to deficiencies of these essential nutrients.
> Special and nutraceutical ingredients

Several special ingredients (food additives or other nutritional supplements) are added to low-calorie foods to induce certain benefits. They are principally various sources of dietary fiber, antioxi-

chromium to foods is not permitted in Europe. A non-exhaustive list of these products and the
benefits identified are presented in Table 14.

Obesity

L-carnitine is not synthesized in muscle but provided by the
blood following hepatic or renal synthesis or via the intestinal
absorption of the L-carnitine present in food. The main dietary sources are red meat, fish and dairy products, whereas white
meat is less rich in L-carnitine and vegetables do not contain
any L-carnitine. L-carnitine is not considered to be an essential nutrient, because it is synthesized by the organism. L-carnitine deficiency is responsible for dilated cardiomyopathies in
a small population of dogs. Several studies on monogastric animals have suggested that the provision in the diet of L-carnitine improves nitrogenous retention and modifies the body
composition in favor of muscle mass. This effect has been
shown in growing dogs (Gross & Zicker, 2000).

2 - Treatments for obese animals

L-carnitine is an amino acid synthesized de novo in the liver
and the kidney from lysine and methionine and in the presence of ascorbate. L-carnitine is an agent that facilitates the transportation of long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria where
they are subjected to β-oxidation (Figure 9). Adequate levels
of L-carnitine are therefore needed in muscle to produce energy from fatty acids.

Because muscle mass requires more resting energy than fat mass, augmentation of muscle mass may
prevent obesity. The incorporation of L-carnitine into low-calorie diets for obese dogs is recommended to modify body composition (Allen, 1998; Sunvold et al, 1998; Caroll & Côté, 2001). The
addition of L-carnitine to a low-calorie diet increases the weight loss in obese dogs and stimulates
the maintenance of muscle mass (Sunvold et al, 1998). In this trial, no significant differences were
noted between the two supplemental levels (50 and 100 mg/kg of food).

Obesity

The incorporation of L-carnitine is recommended
for obese dogs fed a low-calorie diet to prevent
the rebound effect. In home-prepared rations
the choice of ingredients naturally rich in
L-carnitine is recommended.

Conjugated fatty acids derived from conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) have been widely studied in animals due to their various beneficial properties, with effects on neoplasias, atherosclerosis, obesity, the immune function and diabetes mellitus. CLAs are naturally found in ingredients that come from animals, such as dairy products, meats and
fats. They are synthesized in the rumen by certain microorganisms and by some animal
enzymes. The two isomers identified as being biologically active are 9-cis, 11-trans and
10-trans, 12-cis (Figure 10). Some specific CLA isomers prevent the development of
obesity in mice and pigs. Nevertheless, the properties of CLAs to modulate obesity in
humans and monogastric animals remains a subject of controversy, as clinical trials have
produced contradictory results (Azain, 2003). It has however been shown that the 10trans, 12-cis isomer prevents the accumulation of triglycerides in human pre-fat cell cultures. This antiadipogenic action is partly due to an effect on the regulation of the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids in the fat cells (Brown & McIntosh, 2003).
In humans, the effect found is a reduction of fat mass. The work also supports the fact
that the CLAs do not help reduce the body weight of obese patients but do increase
the lean mass at the expense of the fat mass (Kamphuis et al, 2003). The doses used in
the clinical trials on humans were of the order of 1.4-6.8 g of CLA per day (Blankson et
al, 2000; Kamphuis et al, 2003).

The isomers (10-trans, 12-cis) and (9-cis, 11-trans) of linoleic acid are the main components

a methyl radical.

In dogs, the addition of CLA (0.6% DM) in a low-calorie high protein diet (55% DM) has helped
limit the augmentation of the plasma nitrogen concentration typically observed when this type of
diet is used (Bierer & Bui, 2003). A second study shows a positive effect of CLAs on body composition and the ingestion of food in dogs fed ad libitum. Lastly, an in vitro fermentation trial shows
that CLAs are produced in very low quantities by the intestinal bacteria in dogs. The authors therefore recommend the addition of CLA to low calorie diets (Fukoda et al, 2002).

Garcinia Cambogia extract is used to limit lipogenesis in humans (Cha et al, 2003; Hayamizu et
al, 2003). The active ingredients are hydroxycitrates or AHA (alpha hydroxycitric acid), commonly known as “fruit acids.” The expected benefits include inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis and a reduction of energy ingestion (Westerterp- Plantenga & Kovacs, 2002). The mechanisms of action have not been clearly established.
> Low-calorie home-prepared diets

Obese dogs can be fed home-prepared diets. However, the conditions described above must
be respected. Lean ingredients should be selected (lean meat), high-fiber sources of starch
(complete cereals), vegetables, dietary fiber supplements in purified form (bran, soy fiber) and
the diet must be carefully formulated to ensure it is complete and balanced. Compared with a
maintenance diet the protein-calorie ratio will be higher as will the micronutrient concentration
and the dietary fiber percentage. Nevertheless, this last point may pose problems if the animal
sorts and leaves the vegetables needed to provide fiber. This can be avoided by using complete
starchy food (bread, rice or pasta). The intake of crude fiber of the ration may then be raised to
4-5% DM. By using dietary fiber supplements it is possible to increase the concentration to 7-10%
DM.

Garcinia Cambodgia
The sole source of alpha hydroxycitric
acid (AHA) in a concentrated form is
found in certain plants, such as the fruit
of Garcinia Cambogia, which comes
from Southeast Asia.

3 - Clinical food
A consultation with owners of obese dogs requires the veterinarian’s time. It is important to
respect the various steps described above and especially to convince the owner. Such a consultation is of no use if the owner does not want it or if those involved do not have the time. This
problem needs at least 30 minutes of everyone’s time.

Approach of the owner
Most owners of obese dogs do not on their own accord schedule an appointment to explore solutions to the problem of obesity in their pet. On the contrary, they are generally unable to evaluate their animal’s weight condition (Singh et al, 2002). That means that it is up to the veterinarian
to identify the problem, convince owners of its seriousness and motivate them to implement a dietary change. Owners also have to be warned that the diet will not be easy and will be spread over
a long period.
Two types of approach are envisaged in terms of communication, positive messages that explain all
the advantages of slimming for the dog’s health (e.g. greater alertness, etc) and negative messages
explaining all the adverse effects of obesity and associated diseases. It is advisable to adapt the
approach to suit the owner of the animal. It is not always necessary to put forward a large number
of arguments. Select the arguments that are most likely to appeal to the owner, such as longevity,
quality of life and the owner’s responsibility to keep the animal in a healthy condition. It is necessary to present precise arguments, directly linked to the problems presented by the animal and to
focus on the improvement or eradication of the disease to motivate the owner. The owner will also
feel that the problem is being taken seriously if the veterinarian or other clinic staff are available
during the period of dietary therapy.

MOTIVING A CHANGE
(G. Muller)

Malarewicz wrote “every request for change is accompanied
by a request not to change...” (Malarewicz & Reynaud, 1996).
With respect to our problem, this could be expressed as “I would like my dog to
lose weight but I don’t want to change its food” or “my dog is too fat but I love
giving him treats and seeing him eat them with pleasure.”
Every veterinarian knows that simply prescribing a diet will not be enough to
obtain weight loss in the dog. The difficulty lies in motivating owners to keep to
the diet and to help them remain strong when their dog begs for a treat.
Prochaska & DiClemente (1984) have created a model for motivating change,
divided into various steps. This model is well suited to guiding your prescription
(Figure 11).
• Step one: Absence of awareness
In this pre-contemplation phase the veterinarian must state the facts of the case:
“Your dog is overweight because…” or “Your dog has put on weight since the last
visit.” This step lasts until an owner is able to say that the dog is too fat..
• Step two: Contemplation
The owner has become aware of the problem and the veterinarian must invite her
or him to contemplate change and the reasons for it. Owners have to be helped if
they are not to revert to step one. They have to be shown that the situation is
abnormal and that change is needed.
• Step three: Awareness of the problem and the necessity of change
The owner has to be shown how the change can be achieved. Clearly, as
mentioned above, it is important to monitor that the situation does not go
backwards. The benefit of the diet is always situated in the future, while the
pleasure of the treat is immediate.

> Anamnesis and dietary history

The discussion must focus on several general points, not
the least the dog’s environment and specifically the way
it is fed. While it is not always possible to calculate the
energy ingested by the obese animal, a discussion with
the owner will be a source of direct and indirect information and input for the formulation of solutions that
avoid pitfalls. The following information may prove useful:
- Regular food: brand, type, energy value
- Daily quantity
- Feeding method: ad libitum versus limited quantity
- Identification of the person who feeds the dog and other
people involved
- Distribution of treats, leftovers, etc.
- Number of animals in the home and the obese animal’s
potential access to food.
In the case of extremely obese animals it is essential to
ensure that the quantities of energy given as part of a diet
are lower than those typically consumed by the dog. In
the extreme obesity phase energy expenditure can be
very low.
> Clinical examination and
determination of weight loss

The aim of the clinical examination, and where necessary various supplementary tests, is to check that the state
of obesity is not secondary to an endocrine disease. The

determine the best energy allocation (Table 11). The
length of the diet can be calculated on the basis of this
data. Bearing in mind this is a consultation by a general
practitioner these parameters may appear to be fairly technical, but it must not be forgotten that
the interviewee is the owner of the animal and clear, data-based messages (“Your dog must lose x
kg in y months”) are much more persuasive than a vague approach (“Your dog is too fat. We are
going to put him on a diet”).

> Selection of food

English Bulldog
A discussion with the owner
will be enough to identify the dog’s
bad eating habits.

Commercial foods for treating obesity in domesticated carnivores must have a low energy density. In fact, it is a legal requirement (Diez et al, 1995), albeit a fairly vague one. The various types
of low-calorie food are presented above. Whatever the type of product selected, it must be complete, balanced and palatable. A lack of palatability may actually cause the dog to refuse the food,
which is not the desired goal. Traditional means can be used to increase the palatability of food,
such as adding water or introducing a period of transition.
> Rationing and spreading

The selection of the level of restriction and the type of food depends to a large degree, on the initial situation. The aim is to obtain a sustainable modification in the food to obtain a sustainable
reduction in body weight in the long term. In humans, the practice of highly restrictive diets that
40

Obesity

3 - Clinical food

permit rapid and easy weight loss is advised against. This method does not produce better results
and fuels relapse and the rebound effect. The vicious circle of major restriction and compensatory hyperphagia provokes incessant weight fluctuations and in the long term aggravates the situation.
In the case of dogs the problems are not the same at all, because in principle the diet is controlled after weight loss has been achieved. That means that a severe restriction is not necessary if
the dog is moderately obese and does not present clinical signs, and if weight loss is not considered necessary due to the appearance of a pre-diabetic state. A moderate restriction and a relatively slow loss of weight can certainly be contemplated in these cases. On the other hand, a much
more radical approach will be necessary when the dog presents for example, severely obese and
with a torn cruciate ligament, especially if the surgeon refuses to intervene before the dog has lost
a significant amount of weight. Such a pathological history makes the owner highly vigilant with
respect to the risk of relapse. In this case, his motivation is high enough to allow a severe restriction.

Obesity

The principles of rationing and the way the consultation of the obese dog is conducted as shown
in Tables 15 and 16 are inspired by the recommendations of several authors (Andersen & Lewis,
1980; Lewis et al, 1987; Parkin, 1993; Laflamme & Kuhlman, 1993b; Laflamme et al, 1994b; Wolfsheimer, 1994b; Diez et al, 2002). The daily energy allocation is calculated on the basis of the initial obesity: 50-85 kcal /kg BW 0.75 is ideal and varies depending on the sex and the desired speed
of weight loss (Table 11). Such rationing leads to a weight reduction. If the weight of the animal
does not fall, the intake will have to be reduced again after verifying that the owner is not giving
the dog extra food or treats (Markwell et al, 1990). The aim is to induce a weekly loss of 1-2% of
the initial weight. Spreading the daily ration over three or four (and at least two) meals will increase
postprandial thermogenesis (Leblanc & Diamond, 1985).

TABLE 15 - EXAMPLE OF HOW TO DETERMINE THE QUANTITIES OF LOW-CALORIE FOOD TO BE GIVEN

Step 1

Determining the optimal weight and the excess weight

Neutered bitch of undetermined breed, body weight: 19 kg
Estimated ideal weight: 15 kg
Excess weight: (19/15) = 27%

Step 2

Selecting the daily energy allocation
(Table 11)

Excess weight less than 30%:
- 80 kcal/kg ideal BW 0.75, for a loss of 6% of initial weight per month
- 75 kcal/kg ideal BW 0.75, for a loss of 7.5% of initial weight per month

Step 3

Calculating the daily energy allocation

Energy allocation = 80 x 150.75 = 610 kcal for a loss of 6%
of initial weight per month

Step 4

Determining the daily quantity of food
(energy concentration: 3275 kcal /kg)

Daily quantity: 610/3275 = 0.185 kg,
spread over two or three meals

Step 5

Estimating the length of the diet based on
a loss of 6% per month

Initial weight: 19 kg, quantity to be lost: 4 kg
Length of the diet: 4 /(19 x 0.06) = 3.5 months

CAUSES OF THE REBOUND EFFECT
> Behavioral support

Dietary habits must be changed to produce weight loss in the dog and then stabilize the weight.
Giving leftovers and treats may lead the dog to beg (Norris & Beaver, 1993). The dog should be
fed only in its bowl and should be kept at a distance when the humans in the household are
eating, especially if they are used to giving the dog food at these times. Bad habits can be replaced with new rituals.
> Monitoring the dog during the diet

• Scheduling checkups
It is reasonable to ask the owner of an obese animal to bring the dog for a checkup every month
to evaluate the speed of weight loss, conduct a clinical examination and adjust the energy quantities and so the food given if necessary. The dog must be weighed once a week, however, at the
same time and with the same scales, if at all possible.

• Establishing a weight loss curve
A weight loss curve enables visualization of the development of the dog’s weight and is a motivating factor for the owner. During the first visit, it is advisable to establish an individual weight
loss curve showing the initial weight and the curves for 1% and 2% of initial weight loss per week.
There are computer programs for quickly visualizing projected weight loss. The owner’s reference
is to keep the dog’s weight between the two curves. The prognosis depends almost exclusively on
the owner’s motivation (Markwell & Butterwick, 1994).
In practice, the initial weight loss target is rarely achieved: the actual loss is generally lower than
1-2% of initial weight per week. In two control studies the weekly losses were 0.78% and 0.86%
respectively. In a third study on 9 obese dogs the rate of loss varied between 0.8% and 3.1% (average: 1.9%) per week for a length varying from 4 to 38 weeks (average: 18). All the dogs achieved the target weight established at the start (Diez et al, 2002).

• Absence of awareness that the maintenance
of ideal weight is a long-term target
• Absence of long-term changes in dietary habits
and the return to a certain laxness, due to either
ignorance or ease. The owner starts to give
the dog treats and leftovers or stops weighing
the daily quantities.
• Absence of exercise: reduction in walks,
reduction in available space after moving house,
etc.
• Changes to the environmental conditions that
favor a constant weight: the dog is put in a
vacation kennel (absence of the owner), arrival
of another animal in the home, absence of
control of those that feed the animal (children,
neighbors, friends, staff, etc.)
• Changes to the food initiated by the owner
or the veterinarian: switch to a higher-energy
food without adjusting quantities
• Changes in the dog’s living or health
conditions: appearance of anxiety, aging or
disease.

The list above is not exhaustive. It
would appear that maintaining the ideal
weight is a target that necessitates the
active involvement of the dog’s owners.

4 - Post-diet monitoring

Obesity

There are many reasons that may explain these differences and they all deserve attention. The
first is clearly the owner’s lack of motivation when at home: giving the dog quantities in excess of
the amounts agreed, as well as treats and leftovers. The complete lack of control with respect to
total food ingestion is another problem: knowledge of the energy value of a staple is often poor.
The lack of exercise is also to blame. Lastly, not adjusting the ration during the diet is a major factor for failure.

Physical exercise
The aim of physical exercise is to increase energy expenditure and prevent the loss of muscle mass
and bone mass. The effect of weight loss associated with physical exercise generally improves the
animal’s endurance; these are the positives for owners. There are pathological conditions, however, including an osteoarticular complaint or a torn cruciate ligament, that make exercise impossible, at least for a certain period of time.

4 - Post-diet monitoring

© M. Weber

Once weight loss has been achieved, it is vital to monitor the dog’s weight regularly and provide
the owner with advice on the selection of a maintenance food and the quantity of rations. In dogs,
ideally checkups should be scheduled every month until the dog’s weight has stabilized over a period of three to four visits; fluctuations in weight must be limited to around 5% (Burkholder & Bauer,
1998).

There have not been any studies
published on the long-term development
of body weight of companion dogs that
have followed a low-calorie diet.

Generally speaking, at the end of the diet a gradual dietary transition is preferred, in terms of both
quantities and type of food. The veterinarian has two options:
-Continuing with the same (low-calorie) type of food and gradually increasing the quantities to
maintain the weight.
- Selecting a food with a little higher energy density while maintaining the same quantity as
at the end of the diet. This will increase the energy intake. So if the energy density of a lowcalorie food is 2800 kcal/kg for example, the same quantity of food with an energy density of
3200 kcal/kg will automatically lead to increased daily energy intake of 14%. This is a relatively simple option; it consists in changing the food without changing the quantities. It will be
appropriate for the transition of a food that is a little energy-denser, but it is not recommended
if the food selected is much richer in energy.
A rebound effect is generally observed in dogs in the absence of strict measures (Kimura et al, 1991;
Laflamme & Kuhlman, 1995). There are no precise figures relating to the scale of this rebound
effect. In humans, long-term studies appear to show that the weight put back on in the twelve
months following the end of the diet is between around 33% and 50% of the weight lost during
a low-calorie diet. It is therefore advisable to consider obesity as a chronic disease that requires
permanent monitoring (Wadden, 1993).
From a practical perspective, the quantity of energy needed to maintain a constant weight must
be known and, all things being equal (the dog’s activity level and lifestyle, etc.), it must be adjusted when the food is changed. It is important to warn owners not to change the food without verifying the energy intake. This point is particularly important, because obese dogs are often older
individuals and as a consequence it is highly likely that their food has been changed to respond
to different physiological (aging) or pathological conditions. Lastly, it should be noted that there
is a flagrant lack of data on weight monitoring after a diet.
After making huge efforts to achieve the targets set at the start of the process, at the end of the
diet owners may lapse into old habits, in spite of their contentment at how their dog looks.

5 - Prevention of obesity

5 - Prevention of obesity
The best treatment for obesity is prevention
Knowledge of the epidemiology of obesity is a prerequisite for active lifelong preventative tools.
Prevention is either passive or active.
Passive prevention consists in collecting as much data as possible throughout the animal’s life and
using the data to the fullest extent. In day-to-day veterinary medicine all dogs must be weighed
and the data carefully noted in the patient’s file and ‘passport.’ Passive prevention also involves
the use of body condition scoring.
Active prevention goes further. It consists in taking responsibility for the dog’s food and its energy ration, and continuing to monitor its diet throughout its life.

Conclusion
As we have progressed through this chapter, we have seen that canine obesity is a major pathology that affects approximately 25% of the dog population. Bearing in mind the knowledge we
have today, it is unacceptable to ignore a disease that has so many harmful consequences for the
animal’s health and that reduces its life expectancy. When prevention proves ineffective the veterinarian must develop a systematic approach that takes account of diet, from a quality and quantity perspective, and the other environmental factors. All told, the owner’s perception of the message will determine the success of the nutritional treatment and the subsequent maintenance of
the body weight.

BEHAVIORS OR TOOLS CAN BE DEVELOPED BY VETERINARIANS
TO ENCOURAGE OWNERS TO PREVENT OBESITY

For puppy owners highlight which breeds that are predisposed to obesity, provide information on the
expected adult weight, encourage the graphing of weight growth curves, discourage bad habits, emphasize
the harmful effects of obesity and provide comprehensive and personalized information on food.
Generally speaking, provide precise information about food for dogs. Recommend quantities and types
of food, behaviors to avoid, highlight every change in body weight, even minor, and establish a link
with dietary habits in the home.
Limit the energy intake of animals immediately after neutering.
Encourage regular exercise and if possible, quantify it (minimum x hours per week).
Organize a multidisciplinary consultation for obese dogs together with an endocrinologist and a behaviorist.
Organize a dog health consultation in the form of an annual checkup and show an interest in monitoring
the dog’s weight and diet.
Provide a platform scale in the waiting room or a special room for example so that owners are encouraged
to weigh their animals regularly.
Provide information on canine obesity in layperson’s terms with posters in the waiting room, information
sheets, ‘before’ and ‘after’ photos, etc.
Involve all staff in the veterinary clinic in the fight against obesity and encourage original initiatives,
such as obesity awareness-raising days.

Questions and answers

Obesity

Owners’ questions

Q

A

What should I do if my dog refuses
to eat its diet food?

In any event, the food must be weighed and given in several small meals at fixed intervals.
There is no use reducing the time of presentation and increasing the number of meals. Giving
the dog 30 minutes to eat its food three or four times per day is a more effective way of stimulating ingestion than filling the bowl and letting to dog decide when it eats. Mixing the food
with warm water may also increase palatability.
Never eat in the presence of your dog; have it leave the room when you eat or prepare the
family meal. You could give the dog part of its daily ration in the form of kibbles as a reward.

What should I do if my dog is
hungry and keeps begging for food?

Instead of giving your dog food, take it for a walk, give it a stroke or lavish it with attention in
some other way. There are behaviorists who recommend some original techniques, including
keeping a container on the table for the food that you want to give your dog, be it snacks or
leftovers. The aim is to stop the dog begging; behavior that is strengthened periodically when
the owner gives the dog food extras. The container is then emptied into the dog’s bowl at the
dog’s own meal time. In most cases, the container will remain empty after a few meals.

What should I do if I have two or
more animals in my home?

There must be a strict separation at mealtimes. A cat’s food can be placed somewhere high up,
out of reach of an obese dog. The bowls must never be exchanged. If two animals have different needs they will obviously have to be fed differently, from the perspective of both quality
and quantity. This aspect must be explained at the first consultation.

What should I do if it is impossible
for me to feed my dog at least three
times a day?

It is important to spread the ration throughout the day in order to increase the loss of energy.
The daily ration must be spread over at least two meals.

Could a restrictive diet make my dog
aggressive?

Never. Aggression due to energy restriction is a sign of a serious problem in the relationship
between the owner and the dog.

Is it okay to give my dog just a few
small treats?

No, it is totally inadvisable to give the dog treats. A low-calorie diet entails not only a drastic
reduction in dietary intake but also a long-term change in habits to avoid a rebound effect. As
a consequence, this type of behavior should be cut out. It is possible to reserve a portion of the
weighed kibbles of the daily ration to give to the dog after exercises or at other times when
treats are customarily given. But the owner must never be given the idea that after the diet it
will be okay to revert to the old situation that made the dog obese in the first place. The veterinarian must be very clear on this matter before taking on the obese dog.

46

Obesity

Q

A

If the weight loss is negligible or
non-existent after a few weeks
of the diet what should I do?

Verify that the animal has been weighed on an empty stomach using the same scales as were
used at the start of the diet. Check that the dog is not suffering from an endocrine disease or
undergoing a course of medication that is slowing weight loss. Verify that the quantities of food
given correspond to the quantities recommended and that they are weighed carefully. If in
doubt, compare the dietetic food purchased with the length of the diet. Verify that the daily
energy allocation is not greater than the pre-diet intake. If in doubt, calculate the energy allocation again (Table 10). If the owner appears to be telling the truth and the intake is correct,
a 10% reduction in quantities is advisable.

If the weight loss is greater than
2% of initial weight in the first
week should I increase the quantity of food given?

No. During the first few weeks of the diet the weight loss may be greater than foreseen. Ideally, it should not exceed 3% of initial weight. But after this somewhat abrupt start a slowing
down and eventual stabilization of the weight loss is generally observed. It has also been shown
that the initial quantities often have to be restricted at the end of the diet for dogs that are
very overweight. That is why it is sometimes advisable to wait a few weeks before increasing
the quantities. On the other hand, owners appear to be very satisfied when the dog loses a lot
of weight at the start of the diet. This could have an encouraging effect, but the reverse may
also be true. An often observed reaction is a flagging of discipline, resulting in an attenuation
of the weight loss. One way of preventing this is to check the dog frequently at the start of the
diet to ensure that the diet is being followed.

Key points
to remember:

When estimating the energy need of a dog
in good physical condition
There are many equations that
attempt to describe the determination of energy need as a function of
weight. In the canine species, the
body weight range is so wide that
the maintenance energy requirement (MER) cannot be directly
expressed as a function of body
weight (BW): a 50-kg dog clearly

consumes less than two 25-kg dogs.
The MER must be calculated on the
basis of metabolic weight, using an
allometric equation of the type:
Maintenance energy requirement
(MER) = a x Body Weight (kg) b

The problem is inherent in the evaluation of coefficients a and b, and
the results differ slightly depending
on the experimental conditions and
the size of the groups: a few
examples are shown in the table
below.

be realized based on observation of
fluctuations in body weight and

body condition score. The MER
actually varies considerably from one
individual to another. While it is
sometimes difficult to weigh a largebreed dog when it has reached its
adult weight, there are parameters

that allow its physical condition to
be estimated. Ideally, the ribs and
the vertebral column are not visible,
but easily palpable, and the waist is
also clearly discernable.

Key Points
to remember:

In the estimation of the energy value of the food
In its 1974 and 1985 editions, the
NRC proposed two different equations for calculating the metabolizable energy (ME) value of a food:

* Nitrogen-free extract (NFE) roughly represents total digestible carbohydrate. It is obtained by the difference:

1. Equation proposed by the NRC in
1974 for the calculation of the energy for simple ingredients (also
known as the Atwater equation).
This equation has been used in
human nutrition since 1902.

NFA = 100 - (% moisture + % protein
+ % fat + % mineral + % crude fiber)

ME (kcal/100 g) = (4 x % proteins) +
(9 x % fats) + (4 x % nitrogen-free
extract*).
1. Equation advised by the NRC in
1985 (modified Atwater equation)
ME (kcal/100 g) = (3.5 x % proteins) +
(8.5 x % fats) + (3.5 x % nitrogenfree extract*)

The differences between the coefficients used reflect the different
hypotheses with respect to the digestibility of the categories of nutrients:
- The Atwater equation estimates
the digestibility of protein at 91%,
and those of fat and NFE at 96%.
- The modified Atwater equation
estimates the digestibility of protein, fat and NFE at 80%, 90% and
85%, respectively.

What is the best equation?
The ideal equation depends on the
dietary content, as shown by the
graph below, which compares the
energy value measured and the
theoretical energy value calculated
with the two equations.
- The Atwater equation gives values
close to the values measured, albeit
slightly overestimated, when the
food contains low levels of fiber
and is consequently characterized
by high digestibility.
- The modified Atwater equation is a
better reflection of the reality in
the case of food containing a high
level of fiber that is consequently
characterized by low to medium
digestibility.

The values measured with the Atwater equation (in
red) are closer to the values measured (black line) than
those calculated with the modified Atwater equation (in
green) for food containing more than 3800 kcal of ME
(±12% of fats, 5-7% of total fiber).

Measured energy (kcal/kg)

The high digestibility coefficients of the food (95-97%
for fats; 84-87% for proteins) are actually close to the
initial hypotheses of the Atwater equation.

Conclusion
The lowest metabolizable energy
level of a food is the value obtained
after digestibility measurements are
taken in dogs. In the absence of
measured values, the Atwater equation should be reserved for highly
digestible foods and home-prepared
diets.
The daily ration for a dog is obtained by dividing the daily energy
requirement by the metabolizable
energy value of the food.

T

he skin is a major organ both in terms of surface area
(1m2 for a 35-kg dog) and roles (social, maintenance
of a stable internal environment, immune response, etc).
In constantly rejuvenating itself the skin mobilizes a large part of
the macro- and micronutrients provided by the food. An imbalanced
intake of amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins or trace elements
disrupts the barrier function (Table 1) and the immune
protection provided by the skin. The dog may become more
sensitive to infection and can develop allergic reactions more
easily. The skin and the coat accordingly are the mirror of
the dog’s health and the quality of its food. There are many forms
of nutritional dermatosis that frequently affect dogs (Table 2).

Nutrition has a special place in canine dermatology, not only
as an essential factor in the prevention of skin diseases, but also
as a therapeutic tool for allergy, keratoseborrheic and metabolic
dermatopathies.
58

The risks of developing nutritional dermatoses are not only related to the quality of the food, but
also to individual factors in the animal such as the physiological stage, the type of hair and the
predisposition to certain metabolic or allergic diseases.

Breed specificities
There are many breed-related predispositions in canine dermatology that can be directly linked
to nutrition (Table 3).
The two main groups of nutritional dermatoses (zinc or vitamin A responsive dermatoses) are the
major causes of keratinization problems in predisposed breeds (e.g. Nordic breeds with respect to
zinc).

1 - Risk factors

1 - Risk factors

In dogs with a dense coat (e.g. Pomeranian, Spitz, Shih Tzu), the quantity of hair is such that skin
and coat maintenance and rejuvenation of the skin and coat accounts for 30-35% of daily protein requirement (Mundt & Stafforst, 1987). It is possible that the nutritional requirements of animals with a long coat and dense undercoat exceed that of shorthaired breeds.

Coat
The influence of nutrients on the color of the coat is well
known. The coat’s pigmentation depends on the presence
and the distribution of pheomelanin (yellow-red) and
eumelanin (black) pigment grains in the cortex and/or the
medulla of hairs and along the pilary stem. The synthesis of
these pigments depends on the intake of aromatic amino
acids (phenylalanine [Phe] and tyrosine [Tyr]) and the activity of the tyrosinases (cupric enzyme) (Figure 1).

FIGURE 2 - INFLUENCE OF DIETARY
TYROSINE INTAKE ON COLOR INTENSITY
IN BLACK DOGS

Eumelanin

Dietary imbalances in animals with a dark or black coat may
provoke the reddening of the coat (Busch-Kschiewan et al,
2003). This was initially shown in cats. In cats a slight imbalance in the aromatic amino acid intake may provoke the
appearance of neurological problems (sensorial neuropathy)
(Dickinson et al, 2004) and lightening of the coat in red cats,
or the reddening of the coat in black cats (Yu et al, 2001).

Reddening is also a common pigmentation anomaly in large
dogs with a black coat. Work conducted on Newfoundland
puppies and black Labrador puppies (Zentek et al, 2003)
shows that, in canines too, the level of phenylalanine and tyrosine needed
to guarantee optimal coat pigmentation is twice that of the minimum
requirements to ensure the puppy’s optimal growth. They also showed that
tyrosine supplementation in food helps increase the intensity of coat color
(Figure 2). The nutritional recommendations based on the study of growth (NRC, AAFCO) do not allow estimation of the requirements necessary for some metabolically intense functions such as the production of melanine.

Age and physiological condition
The age or the physiological condition may influence the relationship between skin homeostasis, coat quality and food.

Dermatology

There is a higher likelihood of dietary hypersensitivities in breeds suffering from malassimilation
and atopy.

Over a 6 month period, these dogs have
consumed the same diet, differing only in tyrosine
and phenylalanine content (Tyr + Phe).
From the left to the right, the (Tyr + Phe)
intake represents 3.2, 2.6 and 1.9 times the
estimated AAFCO requirement for growth.
The effect of the diet is obvious: the black color is
more intense in the dog on the left whereas, on
the right, the growing hair have a reddish color.

60

In dogs, immaturity of the immune system and high intestinal permeability
may to some degree explain the prevalence of dietary hypersensitivities in
the young animal (Day, 1999; Prélaud, 1999) as it does in humans (Chehade & Mayer, 2005). These phenomena may be more common during weaning.
Nutritional deficiencies appear more readily when the dogs’ nutritional
requirements exceed simple maintenance requirements: for example chronic disease, during gestation, lactation and growth, and especially in largebreed dogs. These deficiencies in protein, essential fatty acids and zinc,
may result in keratinization defects.

Concurrent diseases
Any disease that disrupts the assimilation of nutrients may have direct and indirect consequences
on the quality of the coat and favor the development of concurrent diseases. Malassimilation is
frequently associated with a dull and dry hair coat or even recurrent bacterial infections. Defective protein digestion may cause a decrease in immune tolerance as clearly demonstrated in human
and murine models.
In dogs, this phenomenon is frequently described in German Shepherds with exocrine pancreatic failure (Biourge & Fontaine, 2004; Wiberg et al, 1998) and Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers suffering from protein-losing enteropathy (Vaden et al, 2000), which often develop digestive hypersensitivities with cutaneous manifestations (pruritus, recurring pyoderma). Chronic digestive problems or prolonged use of antibiotics may also provoke a deficiency in B vitamins and a secondary deficiency in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).

At birth the skin is very supple and
the number of hair follicles is low.
The fragility of the skin and the
coat means that the puppy is very
susceptible to attacks on the skin
by parasites or infections.
During growth the dermis thickens,
the sebaceous glands increase in size
and the hair follicles multiply: they
increase by 50% in the Miniature
Poodle between week 10 and 28
(Credille et al, 2002). The composition
of skin lipids is also modified
(Dunstan et al, 2002).

In aging dogs, malassimilation is characterized by imbalances in the intake of polyunsaturated fatty
acids.

2 - Nutritional dermatoses

Dermatology

Dietary balance
Poorly balanced nutritional intake may generate spectacular dermatological imbalances. The most
common are due to generic foods that are low in fat with excessive mineral supplementation, the
most common being surplus calcium which inhibits the absorption of zinc (Table 4).

2 - Nutritional dermatoses
Nutritional dermatoses may be specific (identified deficiency of a particular nutrient or group of
nutrients) or non-specific: associated with general underfeeding, poor digestibility of the food or a gastrointestinal absorption problem.

Specific deficiencies
Nowadays, specific nutritional deficiencies are rare. They may, however, be observed in dogs fed
with a poor-quality commercial food or an unbalanced homemade food.
> Vitamin deficiencies

• Vitamin A
Retinol, a fat soluble vitamin, is essential to the differentiation of epithelial cells. As a consequence, retinol deficiency causes a general keratinization problem, with scaling. In the only case
in dogs described in the literature, these problems were associated with visual deficiencies and
digestive problems (Scott et al, 2001).

• Vitamin E

Vitamin E is a generic term covering two classes of
fat soluble molecules: tocopherols (α, β, γ, δ) and
tocotrienols (α, β, γ, δ). Each of these eight different
forms has a specific biological activity. α-tocopherol
is the most widespread form of vitamin E in animal
foods and organisms: it is the form with the greatest
biological antioxidant activity in the cell membranes (Figure 3).
Deficiencies of vitamin E are rare and usually due to
foods whose fats are poorly stabilized (Scott & Sheffey, 1987). Vitamin E is actually a natural antioxidant, being consumed during oxidation. An experimental deficiency in dogs provokes the appearance
of dry seborrhea, diffuse alopecia, erythroderma,
secondary pyoderma and anomalies of the immune
system.

Only alpha-tocopherol is synthesized.

• B vitamins
B vitamins are water soluble and play a role as coenzymes for the cellular enzymes involved in energy metabolism and tissue synthesis. They are provided in food and some are synthesized by gastrointestinal flora. Deficiencies are rare. A correctly formulated commercial food stored in good conditions contains vitamins in sufficient quantities
and supplementation is not necessary.
The dermatological manifestations of such deficiencies vary depending on the vitamin:
- Riboflavin deficiency (vitamin B2), sensitivity to light: xerosis localized to the periorbital and
abdominal regions
62

> Trace element deficiencies

Trace elements are mineral substances that act at very low concentrations in the organism. The
trace elements most directly related to the beauty of the coat are iron, zinc and copper.

• Zinc
Deficiencies in zinc intake are typically caused by foods high in phytates, which chelate zinc. These
are most often foods of poor quality that are high in whole meal cereal containing a lot of bran.
This intake deficiency is also observed with foods oversupplemented with calcium or in breeds
with an inability to absorb zinc.
Zinc is a cofactor in a very large number of metabolic pathways, and a deficiency provokes immunity problems and keratinization with scaly, crusty
periorificial thickening observed in the skin. The differential diagnosis is
not always easy. Therefore it is important to confirm the clinical diagnosis
in a histopathological biopsy. Zinc deficiency is characterized by major parakeratosis in the epidermis and the follicles.
In contrast to other types of dermatopathies related to metabolic disorders
of zinc (Table 5), a simple deficiency can be controlled by rebalancing the
diet and controlling secondary infection. In previous classifications, this
deficiency is termed generic dog food disease or type-2 zinc responsive dermatitis (common in large-breed dogs) (Figure 4).

• Copper

Copper is a component of many carrier enzymes or proteins. A deficiency
is observed mainly in puppies fed a homemade food without supplementation or with excessive zinc, calcium or iron content. The deficiency leads
to changes in the coat with discoloration beginning in the face, and a thin
coat with dull and brittle hairs (Figure 5) (Zentek & Meyer 1991).

• Iodine

The quantity of trace elements provided in the food does not correspond to
the quantity actually available to the organism. The level of absorption
depends on the chemical form in which they are provided and their dietary environment. There are interactions between the different elements. So
calcium absorption competes with the absorption of zinc, copper and iodine. The percentage of trace element absorption is often under 30%.

deficiency.

While an iodine deficiency could theoretically disturb the synthesis of thyroid hormones, these phenomena are unusual in dogs and generally without
clinical consequence. The daily iodine requirement of a beagle is in the
order of 140 µg. A reduction in total thyroxin is only observed when
concentrations are under 20-50 µg/day, there is no however, in free thyroxin
and no signs of a hypothyroidism (Feldman & Nelson, 2004).

- Niacin deficiency (nicotinamide or vitamin PP), occurring with food low in animal nutrients:
pruriginous dermatitis of the abdomen and hind limbs.
- Biotin deficiency (vitamin B8 or H), mainly described in animals fed with an excess of egg whites,
which contain avidin, a molecule that complexes the biotin and prevents its absorption in the
intestine: erythema, facial and periorbital alopecia, generalized scaling, leukotrichia, dull and
brittle hair.

When the trace elements are provided in the organic form chelated with amino acids their
absorption is clearly improved. Therefore they are better utilized by the organism. For example,
in the presence of an excess of calcium in the ration, which inhibits zinc absorption, loss of zinc
in the feces increases. Conversely with the chelated form, assimilation is not affected (Figure 6)
(Lowe & Wiseman, 1998).

FIGURE 6 - INFLUENCE OF THE FORM OF ZINC INTAKE ON HAIR GROWTH
A chelated trace element is made up
of a metallic ion linked to three amino
acids. This element weighs less than
1500 Daltons. Normal trace element
absorption efficiency varies from 5%
to 30%. When trace elements are
chelated, the absorption efficiency
can be in excess of 60%.

Chelated zinc binds to hair more avidly than zinc in mineral form (zinc oxide) and the speed
of hair growth is significantly faster. Because calcium binds zinc, excessive calcium in the ration
leads zinc oxide to bind to a lesser degree in the hair. Zinc binding is unaffected when zinc is
provided in chelated form.

> Essential fatty acid deficiency

Essential fatty acids are so termed because they are not synthesized by the organism. As is the case
with most vitamins they must be provided by the food. They are primarily the precursors of two
families of PUFA, omega 6 fatty acids and omega 3 fatty acids.
- Linoleic acid, a precursor of fatty acids of the omega 6 family, is abundant in most vegetable oils.
It represents more than 70% of the fatty acids in evening primrose oil and more than 50% in sunflower oil, wheat, corn and soy.
- Alpha linolenic acid, a precursor of fatty acids of the omega 3 family, is found in green vegetables, fruits, grasses and plankton, and is found in concentrated form in the oil of plants like soy
and flax. The oils of fish from cold waters contain very high levels of two long-chain fatty acids
derived from alpha linolenic acid: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA). These two fatty acids participate in the fluidity of the cell membranes.
PUFA fulfill four main functions:
- Incorporation in the structure of the cell membrane, which gives it its flexibility and permeability
- Production of eicosanoids (leukotrienes, prostaglandins)
- Maintenance of the skin barrier permeability (especially omega 6)
- Cholesterol metabolism and transport
PUFA deficiencies are observed only in animals suffering from malassimilation or animals fed with
poor-quality diets or diets that have been overheated for a lengthy period. The cutaneous signs
include xerosis, dull hair and a keratoseborrheic disorder. The response to PUFA supplementation is rapid.

The word keratin comes from the Greek keratos, which means horn. There are several
types of keratin, each with the same basic helicoidal structure. Inside the molecule, their
hinges allow them to be flexible and to interconnect to form resistant filaments.

The low digestibility of proteins may favor
the development of dietary hypersensitivity
(Cave & Marks, 2004).

Methionine and cystine are essential to the growth of hair, as they participate in the production of keratin (Figure 7). These amino acids are
abundant in animal proteins and are rarely deficient in dog food, with the
exception of non-supplemented vegetarian diets.

There is no breed or sex predisposition. The patients are usually old. Dermatological lesions are mucocutaneous and pedal in distribution, and are
characterized by erythema associated with major, painful hyperkeratosis
(Figures 8 A-D). The diagnosis is based on skin biopsies and the identification of the cause of the deficiency (prolonged Phenobarbital intake,
biochemical imbalance, liver and pancreatic ultrasound, biopsies). If the
cause cannot be treated, the prognosis is poor.

© P. Prélaud

Migratory necrolytic erythema (or superficial necrolytic dermatitis, hepatocutaneous syndrome) is a serious dermatosis due to a severe amino acid
deficiency. It originates from chronic liver dysfunction (tumor, cirrhosis,
functional failure induced by the administration of Phenobarbital (March
et al, 2004)) or less commonly from a pancreatic tumor (glucagonoma). It
is most often a deficiency of amino acids, essential fatty acids and zinc
(Campbell & Lichtensteiger, 2000; Scott et al, 2001; Outerbridge et al, 2002;
Turek, 2003).

Low-quality or overcooked food will undergo modification due to Maillard reactions
and the digestibility will be reduced. Hair
growth and the regeneration of the skin
mobilizes almost 30% of protein intake and
such protein deficiency leads to keratinization problems and diffuse alopecia with dull,
brittle hair. Protein deficiencies are also
observed in dogs presented with a chronic
debilitating disease or bitches at the end of
gestation or in lactation, if the dietary intake is not adapted.

NUTRITIONAL TREATMENT OF NECROLYTIC

Amino acid intake
White cheese, egg yolk (1/10 kg body weight/day)
Slow intravenous infusions containing all essential amino acids at 10% every day
Polyunsaturated fatty acid intake
Egg yolk

Zinc intake
Zinc gluconate 10 mg/kg/day;

However, with appropriate nutrition intervention the condition of these animals can
be quickly improved, and in some cases recovery or a very long remission is possible.
Treatment involves intravenous infusion of amino acid solutions (Table 6) or administration of egg yolks and supplementation of essential fatty acids and zinc, at the same
dosages as for zinc responsive dermatosis (Table 7).
Zinc gluconate is preferable to zinc methionine complex, as it is less hepatotoxic. These
nutritional measures are associated with a discontinuation of antiepileptics, antibiotic
therapy and administration of analgesics (opioids), especially when the foot lesions
affect locomotion.

Lethal acrodermatitis in the Bull Terrier is a rare autosomal recessive genetic dermatosis. It is probably a disorder of zinc metabolism, rather than a problem with zinc absorption. The animals present in poor general condition from a very early age (two weeks),

> Zinc responsive dermatosis

Type 1 Zinc responsive dermatosis is not a metabolic disease as such, but results from an abnormality in the intestinal absorption of zinc. It is mainly observed in Nordic breeds of dogs, but many
other canine breeds can be affected, including Beaucerons, German Shepherd dogs, Boston Terriers, Bull Terriers and Great Danes.

The initial lesions are localized to the periorificial zones and the digits: erythema, scaling, which
progress to firmly attached crusts (Figures 10 & 11). Pruritus is present in the case of secondary
infection. A febrile syndrome is sometimes associated with the condition. The diagnosis must be
confirmed by histopathological examination of a biopsy. The differential diagnosis is sometimes
difficult. It includes leishmaniasis in endemic areas, scabies, pemphigus foliaceous or dermatophysis (White et al, 2001).
Zinc supplementation is generally sufficient and a clinical improvement follows in less than a
month. In case of failure, the administration of low-dose glucocorticoid therapy for three weeks
will achieve a rapid improvement in the clinical signs (e.g. oral administration of prednisolone at
0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day for three weeks). The treatment is usually lifelong (White et al, 2001).

The term dietary hypersensitivity covers
all the dermatoses caused by the ingestion of a food that provokes a harmful
reaction in a healthy individual. These
hypersensitivities, also termed intolerances, can be of non-immunological or
immunological origin (Johanson et al,
2001). An immunological hypersensitivity is a dietary allergy. The clinical
manifestations are highly diverse and
include gastrointestinal, respiratory,
cutaneous, renal or generalized involvement (Figure 12).

The various types of dermatitis due to
zinc deficiency (food high in phytates or
calcium and low in essential fatty acids)
have several features in common including an identical histological appearance,
hyperkeratosis of the mucocutaneous
junctions and the pads. Treatment is
based on balancing the diet and administering zinc for three to four weeks (Table 7).

2 - Nutritional dermatoses

Dermatology

> Etiology

• Non-immunological hypersensitivity
The non-allergic reactions are highly diverse. Some foods may cause urticaria or aggravate an atopic dermatitis if they are high in:
- histamine: tomatoes, spinach, beef, pig liver, fresh crustacea, tuna, dry sausage, cheese
- histamine liberator compounds: chocolate, strawberries, fish, pork, ovomucoid
- tryptamine: chocolate, cooked cheese (Prélaud, 1999).

• Gastrointestinal allergies
The development of an allergic reaction depends on the nature of the dietary antigens, their presentation to the digestive immune system and genetic factors.
Break in immune tolerance
The immune response to ingested antigens is generally an immune tolerance reaction. The immune reaction is inhibited when the antigens are present in low concentrations.
When the antigen concentration is high, anergy or even deletion phenomena may occur (Chehade
& Mayer, 2005). This immune tolerance is an active phenomenon that depends on several factors
related to the individual and the antigen (Table 8).
A hypersensitivity reaction may be triggered by the following factors: augmentation of intestinal
permeability, chronic digestive problems, high insoluble antigen content, and individual predisposition to hypersensitivity reactions.
Dietary allergens
The foods most often implicated in the studies on dietary hypersensitivity in dogs are meat (beef,
chicken, lamb), eggs, dairy products and soy, but any dietary protein is potentially allergenic. The
very nature of the allergens implicated in these allergies is well known in human medicine, where
the major allergens and their structural particularities have not been defined in the dog (Breiteneder & Mills, 2005).
When it comes to dogs, our knowledge is very limited. The overwhelming majority of allergens
identified in dogs are proteins of large molecular weight – 40-70 kD. The main allergens of beef
and cow’s mild for dogs may be heavy chains of immunoglobulin G (Martin et al, 2004). There
were however crossed sensitivities between cow’s milk and beef in dogs. The allergy to casein in
cow’s milk has also been demonstrated in the animal models presenting spontaneous dietary allergies (Jackson & Hammerberg, 2002). Lastly, some muscle enzymes common to many species of
mammal could explain the crossed reactions between lamb’s
meat and beef in dogs. This is the case for phosphoglucomuTABLE 8 - FACTORS INVOLVED IN IMMUNE TOLERANCE
tases (Martin et al, 2004).

Weak dose: activation of regulating T cells

In contrast to humans, there are no cross reactions between
pollens and food (with the exception of the cross reaction between tomato and the Cryptomeria japonicum pollen) (Fujimura et al, 2002).
> Predisposing factors

All the factors contributing to immune tolerance can favor the
development of dietary hypersensitivity.

Figure 13B - Chronic
urticaria on the
abdomen of a dog

hypersensitivity.

An increase in intestinal permeability, by greatly increasing the quantity of
allergens presented to the immune system, can break the condition of tolerance and induce deleterious immunological reactions. The inflammatory reaction increases the intestinal permeability and a vicious circle of maintenance
of the phenomenon is maintained.

• Atopy
By definition, an atopic condition predisposes the animal to the development of allergic reactions,
be they aeroallergens or dietary allergens (Prélaud & Olivry, 1998).
> Symptoms

The skin symptoms of dietary hypersensitivity are highly variable and sometimes rather vague.
The clinical presentation may be that of atopic dermatitis, general or local pruritus, or major acute
(skin rash, urticaria) or chronic keratinization problems (Figures 13 A-C).

• Urticaria and angioedema
The most common causes of urticaria in dogs are allergies to medication (vaccines, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-infection drugs including antibiotics, anti-viral, anti-fungal agents, allergens,
etc) or reactions to anthropod bites (Table 9). A dietary cause is less commonly identified. In this
case, it may be due to an immunological phenomenon (immediate allergic reaction), the ingestion of a food that is high in vasoactive amines or anaphylactiod

reactions (mastocyte degranulation without IgE intervention).
DESCRIBED AND SUSPECTED IN DOGS
The allergic reactions to vaccines have some things in common with dietary
allergies, in that, in the majority of cases, the allergy is due to residues of calf
fetal serum in cell cultures (IgG bovines) or to protein additives (casein, gelatins) (Ohmori et al, 2005). As a consequence, it is possible that these vaccine
reactions are due to dietary sensitivities to these same proteins, as some vaccinal allergic reactions are observed during initial vaccination, so theoretically
without prior sensitivity to the vaccine.

The great majority of dietary proteins, which are allergens or potential allergens, are broken down by the gastric and intestinal enzymes, although only
amino acids or small peptides are normally assimilated by the mucosa of the
small intestine. If digestion is defective, the quantity of antigens in the digestive immune system and their molecular weight is much greater, which is conducive to the break in tolerance. This explains why a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease or exocrine pancreatic failure is conducive to the development
of dietary hypersensitivity.

This phenomenon, which is also described in humans,
has led the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology (EAACI) to propose the term atopic dermatitis syndrome, covering all cases of atopic dermatitis
of whatever cause, with or without a demonstrated allergy.
In canine medicine, the term atopic-like dermatitis was
recently proposed by the International Task Force on
Canine Atopic Dermatitis (ITFCAD) to designate cases
of atopic dermatitis without a demonstrable allergy. All
these variations of definition are the origin of confusion
and controversy. If the results of allergological explorations are taken into account, as they are in human medicine, it is impossible to differentiate an atopic dermatitis
due to aeroallergens from an atopic dermatitis due to dietary allergens (Hillier & Griffin, 2001; Jackson et al, 2005)
(Figures 14-16).

As a consequence, its diagnosis may be based on criteria
tied to anamnesis and clinical signs comparables to those
proposed in human medicine (Prélaud et al, 1998) (Table
10).

reactions to environmental allergens. The allergy to
aeroallergens is not however demonstrated in 20-25% of
referred or university atopic dermatitis cases.

Figure 14D - Interdigital erythema in

In approximately 30% of atopic animals, the condition is
significantly improved by an elimination diet. This suggests that dietary hypersensitivities could be considered
as major factors in the etiology of canine atopic dermatitis (Chesney, 2001 & 2002). As a consequence, when
confronted with all the symptoms of canine atopic dermatitis, it is necessary to envisage the existence of dietary hypersensitivity in patients with the following clinical
signs (Prélaud, 2004):
• Bilateral otitis externa
• Bilateral cheilitis
• Bilateral pododermatitis
• Local or widespread Malassezia dermatitis

Dietary hypersensitivity is one of the causes of recurring

however be envisaged after the infection has been
controlled (Figure 18) and the most common hypotheses such as demodetic mange (especially in Labrador
Retrievers and Rottweilers), flea allergy dermatitis
(FAD) and lack of hygiene in dogs with a dense undercoat have been eliminated.

Atopy and less often food allergy is the most common
underlying cause of recurrent superficial pyoderma. No
specific breed or age group is predisposed. Generally, the
lesions (papules, pustules, crusts, epidermal collarettes)
are first observed in the regions of predilection: abdomen
and inguinal region (Figures 19 A & B). They can
spread all over the body. The response to antibiotic therapy is always good, but recurrence will be rapid after the
antibiotic therapy has been stopped.

The diagnosis is based on identifying the lesions and conducting a cytological test to find neutrophilic leukocytes with some evidence of cocci phagocytosis. The differential diagnosis is that
of all recurring superficial pyoderma and comprises at least the exclusion of an ectoparasitic or
another allergic dermatitis (FAD, atopic dermatitis). Once all the causes of recurrence have been

> Diagnosis

The diagnosis of dietary hypersensitivity is based on the elimination of other causes of pruritus
(especially infections and parasites) and the beginning of an elimination diet.
It is tempting to measure specific dietary allergen IgE dosages to identify a dietary allergy or to eliminate some foods from the diet. At this time, such an approach is totally unjustified. The few
studies that have been published show that allergy tests lack reliability in this capacity (Jeffers et
al, 1991; Kunkle & Horner, 1992; Hillier, 1994; Ermel et al, 1997; Mueller & Tsohalis, 1998; Jackson &
Hammerberg, 2002; Foster et al, 2003; Jackson et al, 2003; Wilhelm & Favrot, 2005).
This approach is justified only in the case of an immediate pure allergy, as in human medicine. In
humans, the positive result of measurement of specific IgE for peanuts, eggs or cow’s milk is an
excellent predictor in a patient presented with anaphylactic reactions. For the evaluation of atopic dermatitis, the value of these tests is as poor as it is in canine medicine (Sampson, 2004).
> Practicalities of elimination diets

The principle of an elimination diet is based on the administration of a diet containing proteins
that the animal has never previously ingested. It is vital that an elimination diet be rigorously followed. The compliance with such a diet is its main limitation.

• Monitoring of dietary habits
An elimination diet must be prescribed only after a highly detailed investigation and
with the clear consent of the owner. The diet preparation phase conditions the subsequent implementation.
It is not easy to keep a log of the food ingested by the dog, because the dietary sources
are highly varied. The questionnaire during the consultation should focus on describing
the food itself and identifying all the extras and potential hidden sources of food
consumption. If necessary, the owner must be asked to keep a log of all the food consumed over a two-week period. The diet supplements and medication that may contain
protein palatability factors (e.g. liver) must also be taken into account.

• Choice of food
Protein sources
The ideal is to use sources of proteins and carbohydrates that the dog has never previously
ingested. That is why venison, duck, rabbit and white fish are the most often used ingre-

Homemade preparations
Homemade preparations must be based on a limited number of sources of protein and carbohydrate (Table 13). The significance of homemade preparations is connected with the control of
raw ingredients. Dogs that are used to preparations of this type often find them more palatable
than dry commercial foods.
The use of homemade diets is limited by the practicability of such a preparation, especially for
large dogs. They are increasingly rare for companion dogs because even for a period of one or two
months the preparation of the homemade diet can prove very difficult.
The imbalance of these diets can be easily compensated if the diet has to be followed for more
than two months or if the dog is a puppy. However, the supplementary constraints imposed on
owners may become limiting factors in the good observance of the diet (Tables 14-15).
Commercial foods
There are a great number of commercial foods labeled “hypoallergenic” or “for allergic dermatitis”. Three categories can be distinguished.
- Foods with proteins that mostly come from selected sources: they cannot be considered acceptable for an elimination diet as the protein sources are highly diverse.
- Foods with proteins that exclusively come from selected sources: these are more acceptable. This
is the only category that has been subjected to controlled studies and the results are sometimes
disappointing (Vroom, 1994; Leistra et al, 2001; Leistra & Willemse, 2002).

dients (tuna, which is high in histamine, should be avoided). Protein hydrolysates with a low molecular weight to ensure low immunogenicity and high digestibility can be used whatever the source.
(The available hydrolysates are generally extracted from poultry or soy proteins.)

2 - Nutritional dermatoses

Dermatology

The use of protein hydrolysates raises many questions in both
human and veterinary medicine. Only the studies of cohorts in
human medicine come close to answering any of them.
- Is a highly hydrolyzed food more effective than a traditionally
hydrolyzed food? This has not been shown in either
veterinary or human medicine (Osborne & Sinn, 2003).
- Is a hydrolysate more effective than a homemade diet for
dogs? There are no studies that demonstrate an advantage
for any one type of food.
- Is it worthwhile using a hydrolyzed food on a patient at risk
after the appearance of symptoms? This has been shown
only in infants when they cannot be breastfed (Osborne &
Sinn, 2003).

- Foods formulated on the basis of protein hydrolysates are in principle less
allergenic than non-hydrolyzed preparations. The purpose of the hydrolysate is to fractionate the proteins into small peptides of low molecular
weight. So in practice these hydrolysate-based diets are the most suited to
a commercial elimination diet (Biourge et al, 2004; Loeffler et al, 2004).
Hydrolysis reduces the molecular weight and intrinsic antigenicity of the
food, and also renders it more digestible. These two properties act in synergy to offer less stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune system.
The major advantage of hypoallergenic commercial foods is their ease of
use. This however, does not mean that the owner should neglect the
constraints of such a diet. The prescription of a commercial diet goes hand
in hand with a warning against the possibilities of food consumption over
and above the base diet.

• Concomitant treatments
Antibacterial and systemic steroid therapy may be required when an elimination diet is initiated.
The prescription of flavored medication must be avoided. If the medication must be administered
by mouth with a food, any potential source of protein must be avoided, such as butter, cheese, ice
cream, and meat. Honey is preferred.
The effectiveness of the diet is interpreted six weeks after the end of the course of medication.

• Special cases
Multi-pet households
If more than one animal lives in the household, access to the other animals’ bowls must be avoided or all animals must be given the elimination diet.

Aging dogs
In older dogs, the fairly short length of the elimination diet should not pose any problems in the
case of a commercial food or a balanced homemade ration (see the examples for homemade
rations at the end). On the other hand, the use of standard foods may be problematical: for
example, meat as lean as venison may lead to weight loss. It is also important not to abruptly change the dog’s habits.
Difficult dogs
For difficult dogs, two or three days may be needed to obtain normal consumption of the food.
While feeding should begin with a palatable supplement, after four weeks a supplement of a different nature must be selected and used for the following four weeks (e.g. beef gravy, then fish).
Associated diseases
In cases with an associated disease, it is preferable to use a hydrolysate-based commercial food and
to closely monitor the concurrent disease (e.g. serum fructosamine concentrations after 15 days
of the diet in a diabetic dog).

• Monitoring the diet
Compliance with the diet can be difficult, and information and motivational visits are often necessary. Every member of the family must be informed of forbidden foods that could affect the interpretation of the trial (Table 15).
Regular appointments are needed to monitor compliance with the diet. This will allow the potential secondary effects of the elimination diet to be identified, which are refusal to eat or digestive
problems. A two-day fast is tolerated. In the case of failure, a new diet must be initiated. To limit
the appearance of digestive problems, a period of gradual dietary transition from the previous diet
of at least four days is recommended.
Depending on the food, weight gain or weight loss may ensue. Owners must be informed so that they can monitor the dog’s weight and body condition score and
adjust the quantities given when necessary.

• Length of the diet
There is consensus on the duration of 6-8 weeks to 10-12 weeks at most.
Continuing the diet after this period will be useless if no improvement
has been observed.

• Interpretation of the results
The appreciation of clinical improvement is simple when it is spectacular,
but more difficult when it is partial. Photographs and lesional scores
(simplified CADESI: Table16) or pruritus scores (Table 17) may
prove highly useful.
More is needed if the food is to be identified as the cause of the genesis of pruritic dermatitis than
the observation of a significant improvement. A certain number of dogs do not have any recurrence when they ingest the initial food again. As a consequence, a provocative test must be conducted in order to correctly interpret the effects of an elimination diet.

If a puppy has to follow an elimination
diet it is important to ensure that the
diet is properly formulated for the
special needs of growth.

The sensitivity of PUFA sources to oxidation demands close monitoring of their resistance to oxidation, and increased quantities of vitamin E in the food.

Excessive shedding

When excessive shedding leads to a veterinary consultation, an attempt must be made to identify the potential causes of anomalies in the pilary cycle:
- endocrinopathy
- unadapted environment
- relative deficiency of PUFA, biotin, tyrosine, tryptophan, cystine, vitamin E, vitamin A, choline or folic acid.

© P. Prélaud

Shedding experienced by dog owners as excessive may be physiological, whether it is continuous
or seasonal. The intensity of this shedding depends on many factors including the genetic potential, the hormonal balances, the photoperiod and nutrition.

Figure 20 - Abundant scaling,
showing major xerosis in an atopic
Labrador.

Many nutrients are used to stimulate hair growth, including biotin (Fromageot & Zaghroun, 1990)
and paprika. The addition of paprika (Capsicum tetragonum) to the food increases the intensity of
hair coloration and stimulates the hair growth, particularly during shedding (Greer, 1981).

© P. Prélaud

However, no studies have yet proved that shedding in a dog on a balanced diet can be controlled
by nutritional or pharmacological measures.

Black coat with red reflex
It is possible to prevent the reddening of the coat of dogs with black coats by enriching the diet
with tyrosine. The response time varies according to the hair cycle. If the majority of hairs are in
the telogen phase they are replaced more quickly. The hairs that redden during shedding remain
red even after supplementation of aromatic amino acids.

Figure 21 - Depigmented vitiligo
lesions in a Shar Pei.

Vitiligo
Vitiligo is characterized by depigmented lesions preferentially in the mucocutaneous junctions
(Figure 21). Depigmentation is due to the absence of melanocytes. The causes of vitiligo are highly varied and few effective treatments have been identified at this time. In humans, L-phenylalanine is regularly used (Antoniou & Katsambas, 1992; Camacho & Mazuecos, 2002) and has produced good results in dogs (Guaguère, personal communication).

Skin wound healing
Nutritionists have studied the nutrients that improve the healing of wounds, so as to be in a position to propose nutritional supplements in the pre- and post-surgery period. Human medicine has
a great number of enteral preparations in liquid form. The sought-after properties are stimulation
of re-epithelialization and stimulation of the immune system to limit infection. They could potentially be used in adult dogs, but the protein concentration is insufficient for puppies.

3 - Nutritional therapy in dermatology

The coat’s sheen is connected to the composition of sebum, a natural wax secreted by the sebaceous glands and stored in the hair follicles. Sebum also has the role of preventing the felting of
the hairs by eliminating the relief of the hair scale. Sebum makes the keratin in the hair more
elastic and more flexible. The lipids in the composition of the sebum are species and breed specific (Dunstan et al, 2000), but the production and the quality of the sebum is also influenced by the
food. Some essential nutrients given in higher quantities than the strict recommended minimal
quantities produce a significant improvement in the appearance of the dog’s coat. This is notably
so with PUFA from vegetable sources (omega 6) and zinc. A combined zinc/linoleic acid supplement improves the coat’s brilliance and reduces scale (Marsh et al, 2000).

3 - Nutritional therapy in dermatology

Zinc deficiency is associated with delayed wound healing. Zinc is essential to cell replication and
proliferation.
Iron and vitamin C are involved in hydroxylation of proline, a major amino acid in the structure
of collagen. Iron deficiency affects the quality of the scar tissue.
Omega 3 fatty acids have a positive effect on the inflammatory reaction at the site of wound healing. A vitamin E supplement helps protect PUFA’s from oxidation.
The positive role of curcumin, aloe vera and bromelaine has been shown in the wound healing
process (Fray et al, 2004).
Ideally, these nutrients should be administered 8 weeks before surgery. This period is needed for
the PUFA to act effectively in the skin. The treatment must be continued for at least four weeks
after surgery, depending on the required length of wound healing.

Atopic dermatitis
Canine atopic dermatitis, like human atopic dermatitis, is a multifactorial disease in which nutrition can be used at three levels.
- Re-establishment of the skin barrier function
Atopic dogs have problems with function of the skin barrier, especially defects in the intercellular cement formed by the ceramides (Figure 22) (Inman et al, 2001). This allows water loss, increased transcutaneous penetration by antigens and increased adherence of staphylococci to the surface of the corneocytes.
- Reduction in inflammation

acids: EPA and DHA) or immune response

Dogs suffering from a protein deficiency (e.g. during a fast due to hospitalization) have delayed
wound healing. It is essential to safeguard nitrogen balance to facilitate tissue regeneration, paying
particular attention to glutamine and arginine contents in the food. The production of nitric acid
from arginine stimulates the expression of the endothelial vascular growth factor.

As cement holds together the bricks in a wall,
the ceramides are responsible for the cohesion
of the skin cells.

In vitro studies (keratinocytes cultures) conducted by the Waltham
Research Centre have shown that
some nutrients (in particular: nicotinamide, pantothenic acid, histidine,
inositol and choline) improve the
structure and the function of the skin.
Others (pyridoxine and proline) stimulate the synthesis of ceramides
(Figure 23) (Watson et al, 2003).
In vivo studies have confirmed this
approach. After nine weeks of supplementation with a supplement
composed of nicotinamide, pantothenic acid, histidine, inositol and choline, the cutaneous water loss was
significantly reduced in atopic dogs.
The reduction in water loss and so
xerosis can have a positive effect of
reducing allergen penetration, and
also limit bacterial and fungal colonization, which may cause the development of atopic dermatitis.

> Polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFA)

In the case of pruriginous dermatitis caused by an allergy, omega 3 and omega 6 PUFA
may be used to limit skin inflammation, restore the integrity of the hydrolipidic film
and limit the transcutaneous penetration of allergens and bacterial and fungal infections. Various studies show that the use of supplements high in PUFA reduces skin
inflammation, but does not have any obvious effect on pruritus. They also reduce the
dose of long-term corticosteroid therapy when this is necessary (Saevik et al, 2004).
The efficacy of such a therapeutic approach in the case of canine atopic dermatitis is
more significant in the early stages of the disease (Abba et al, 2005).
In human medicine the preventive use of PUFA is envisaged in the mothers of atopic children. A mother’s food is high in omega 3 and omega 6 PUFA and impacts
the immune response of breastfed children, favoring a Th1-type response (Das,
2004). Such an approach has not been used in dogs, but it could be tried in dogs of
high-risk breeds, like the Shar-Peï and the West Highland White Terrier.
> Curcumin

The addition of curcumin can also benefit dogs suffering from atopic dermatitis,
through mechanisms that are focused on the immune response (inhibition of mast
cell activation, inhibition of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase synthesis, immunoglobulins, etc) (Cuendet & Pezzuto, 2000).

The presence of borage oil in food provides
interesting results in various allergic
manifestations (Quoc & Pascaud, 1996). Borage
oil is frequently used in human dietetics and
cosmetology and is the only oil that contains
more than 20% gamma linolenic acid (GLA).
The efficacy of borage oil is improved when it
is used in association with fish oils, which have
high EPA and DHA contents (Sture & Lloyd,
1995).
These very long-chain omega 3 fatty acids act
in the same way as gamma linolenic acid, albeit
through different metabolic processes. They
inhibit the synthesis of arachidonic acid and
its derivatives, which are responsible for
inflammatory manifestations.

> Primary keratinization disorders

Many primary keratinization disorders justify the use of PUFA or
retinoids. Retinoids control the proliferation of keratinocytes by
reducing the synthesis of sebum and the inflammatory reaction
(inhibition of the expression of chemokines). They are much
more effective than vitamin A and produce fewer secondary
effects. Their use however, is not without risk and they must be
part of a prescription in which the owner is informed and monitoring is provided (Table 18).

• Vitamin A responsive dermatoses
Vitamin A regulates the growth of epidermal cells and the production of sebum. It helps combat
seborrhea and the pellicles that often form after a pruritic episode. It acts in synergy with zinc and
sulfated amino acids.
Vitamin A responsive dermatosis is a rare and much discussed keratinization disorder described
only in the Cocker Spaniel. It is clinically characterized by dull hair and thick, foul-smelling scaling (Figure 24). The diagnosis is based on histopathology that reveals major follicular orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis. Vitamin A supplementation (1000 IU/kg/day) leads to a recovery, although
the response is fairly slow. In case of failure or partial remission, retinoids may be used.

• Ichthyoses

Figure 24 - Attached scaling lesions in
a Cocker Spaniel presenting with
vitamin A responsive dermatosis.

Ichthyoses are genetic keratinization problems. Patients present with thick scaling around the pads
and over the body from a very early age (Figure 25). Predisposed breeds include Cavalier King
Charles Spaniels, Cocker Spaniels, Retrievers, Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers, West Highland
White Terriers, Jack Russell Terriers and Rottweilers. Histopathology helps identify the diagnosis. Treatment is based on the combined use of keratolytic shampoos and PUFA or synthesized
retinoids (Table 18).

• Idiopathic seborrheas
The primary seborrheas will appear at a very early age in some predisposed breeds (particularly
American Cocker Spaniels). This is a genetic anomaly caused by the accelerated regeneration of
the epidermis. The lesions are generalized (oily scaling), sometimes with major localized thickening (on the ventral surface of the neck or in the fold of the elbow, for instance). The diagnosis
is based on the elimination of all causes of seborrhea and skin biopsies.

Keratoseborrheic states

lesions in a Cavalier King Charles.

Treatment includes an anti-infection treatment, localized care (clipping and keratolytic shampoos) and synthetic retinoids. They are administered every day for 3-5 months. If control is satisfactory, intake is reduced to once every two or three days.
> Zinc responsive dermatosis

Several zinc salts are available for the treatment of zinc responsive dermatoses (Table 7). The very
cheap zinc sulfate can be poorly tolerated (vomiting) and must be administered with meals. Zinc
gluconate is generally better tolerated (Guaguère & Bensignor, 2002). Zinc methionine is probably the best absorbed, but it is available only in a preparation in which it is associated with vitamin A and it is expensive. The length of treatment varies from three to eight weeks depending
on the animal and must often be life long.

80

Many keratinization disorders may be accompanied by inflammatory dermatoses caused by an
allergen or a parasite. They do not justify retinoid treatment. The treatment of the associated
infection or the primary cause will control it. Some authors consider that the nutritional requirements are greater during the keratoseborrheic state and that it is accordingly necessary to provide an appropriate diet, enriched with PUFA, vitamin E, zinc and trace elements.

Granulomatous sebaceous adenitis

All breeds can contract this disease, but there are some clear breed predispositions: Akita Inus,
Poodles, Samoyeds and Lhassa Apsos. The diagnosis is based on the examination of multiple biopsies that confirm the destruction of the sebaceous glands. The treatment requires localized care
(keratin modulation shampooing) and general treatments: essential fatty acids, corticotherapy,
cyclosporine, synthetic retinoids (Table 19). The prognosis is always guarded. Given the potential secondary effects (retinoids, corticoids) or the cost (cyclosporin A) of alternative therapeutics, the administration of PUFA must be attempted first, in association with keratin modulating
shampoo.

© P. Prélaud

Granulomatous sebaceous adenitis is a genetic disease characterized by destruction of the sebaceous glands, which gradually disappear, causing keratinization disorders in the hair follicle with
alopecia and the formation of hair flanges. The lesions appear gradually and can be localized in
any region of the body (Figures 26 A & B).

Figure 26A - Granulomatous
sebaceous adenitis in an Akita Inu:
irregular alopecia over the whole trunk,
associated with a keratoborrheic state.

Various immune dermatoses
Vitamin E, due to its antioxidant action, and PUFA are commonly used on their own or as an
adjuvant for immune mediated dermatoses.

PUFA are used for their anti-inflammatory or immunomodulating action in the treatment of
lupoid onychodystrophies with excellent results in one in three cases (Mueller et al, 2003).

Recurring bacterial infections

© P. Prélaud

Vitamin E (400-800 IU BID) is used as an adjuvant for lupus (Scott et al, 2001) and dermatomyositis (Hargis & Mundell, 1992). Used on its own, it is only effective in a very limited number
of cases.

Figure 26B - Same dog as in Figure
26A, after two months’ treatment with
polyunsaturated fatty acids and keratin
modulating shampoo.

Nutrition can play an essential role in controlling recurring infections by helping to reestablish
the skin barrier (skin barrier-type nutrients, PUFA) or by helping to control allergic inflammation (PUFA, hypoallergenic foods).

Prophylactic nutrition
In canine dermatology, nutritional interventions continue to be almost exclusively devoted to therapeutic functions. In human dermatology however, especially allergic dermatology, nutrition is
used preventively (Table 19).
TABLE 19 - EXAMPLES OF NUTRITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LIMITING
THE RISK OF FOOD ALLERGIES IN CHILDREN
(Sampson, 2004)

• Breastfeeding for three to six months
• Use of hydrolysates if breastfeeding is not possible
• Avoidance of peanuts and seafood during pregnancy and breastfeeding
• Avoidance of high-risk foods (peanuts, hazelnuts, seafood) before three years of age

• Secondary seborrheas

Conclusion

> Hypoallergenic and highly digestible foods

Hypoallergenic and highly digestible foods are used in dermatology for therapeutic purposes. In
human medicine these foods are mainly used in the prevention of food allergies in high-risk children, or even breastfeeding mothers. Hydrolysates are used for high-risk children that cannot be
breastfed to significantly reduce the risk that clinical manifestations of atopy will develop (Osborn
& Sinn, 2003). Such an approach could be useful in canine medicine, but it must undergo controlled clinical studies.
> Probiotics

In humans, there is a correlation between the use of antibiotics in infancy or in the mother during
the perinatal period and the development of atopic dermatitis. Conversely, random double-blind
studies show that the administration of probiotics to mothers at risk limits the occurrence of manifestations of atopic dermatitis (extrinsic form) in children (Flohr et al, 2005).
In dogs, the addition of probiotics in the food presents technical problems (Weese & Arroyo,2003).
It is however possible to include them in a dry food and to observe their effect on immune response (Baillon et al, 2004). If the goals of feeding such a food are aimed at the gastrointestinal
tract, preventive or curative use in atopic dogs could also be practical.
© Lenfant

Dermatology

Such an approach could be interesting, the more difficult problem is the identification of individuals at risk. This is problematical in humans (Osborn & Sinn, 2003), but is much easier in dogs,
as certain breeds and lines are predisposed to nutritional or immune dermatoses (Scott et al, 2001).

> Polyunsaturated fatty acids
In high-risk breeds, with respect to
dermatology it would be useful to try
to prevent hypersensitivity phenomena
by modifying the mother’s food
during gestation, as occurs in
human medicine.

Recurring bacterial infections are most often caused by allergic dermatopathies (dietary hypersensitivity, atopic dermatitis) or non-specific skin defense problems. In both cases PUFA supplementation or a skin barrier cocktail may limit the risks of a relapse. It is essential however that
the causes of recurring pyodermititis be identified before diagnosing an idiopathic recurring pyodermititis (Table 12).
PUFA supplementation in human mothers during pregnancy and lactation helps limit the dietary hypersensitivity phenomena in children (Korotkova et al, 2004). Such an approach could be
useful in bitches of high-risks breeds like Shar-Peis or West Highland White Terriers.

Conclusion
Food plays a fundamental role in cutaneous homeostasis and in the treatment of many inflammatory dermatoses. The study of the diet is therefore an integral part of the dermatological history. The correction of dietary imbalances (with respect to zinc and essential fatty acids in particular) is a necessary factor in good dermatological therapy.
It is important to challenge ideas that impede the management of chronic pruriginous dermatitis
on a daily basis. These include the harmfulness of food based on their origin, the value of IgE
doses of dietary allergens, the absence of flea infestation opportunities and the harmfulness of
short-term corticosteroid therapy.
The treatment of keratinization disorders or allergenic dermatites involves the use of nutrients
that reinforce the skin barrier function, or even play an anti-inflammatory role. The future is open
to the possible use of food for prophylactic purposes (probiotics, essential fatty acids, etc) in animals at risks of skin disease.

82

Q

A

Which nutritional deficiencies are
most commonly implicated in
dermatology?

The nutrients involved in skin diseases that are caused by deficiencies are zinc and essential
fatty acids.

How can a zinc deficiency
be identified?

It can be tempting to measure the zinc level in the blood or in the hair, but these methods are
unsatisfactory. The diagnosis is based histopathology of the skin lesions (parakeratotic hyperkeratosis) and the response to supplementation or correction of the diet.

What should you do when a
Siberian Husky showing signs
of zinc responsive dermatosis
does not respond to the
administration of zinc?

First the zinc salt should be changed, for example, prescribe zinc gluconate or zinc methionine instead of zinc sulfate. The prescription of a low dose of corticosteroids (prednisolone:
0.2 mg/kg/day) generally leads to a very significant improvement in zinc absorption and the
control of dermatosis.

Which foods are the most likely to
cause allergenic reactions?

The data provided in the literature do not permit the identification of sources of more allergenic proteins. The knowledge of the very nature of allergens may permit definition of the
high-risk foods in the near future.

Is white meat less allergenic than
red meat?

This belief is incorrect. The color of the meat does not have any influence on its potential
allergenic or hypoallergenic character. Indeed, the origin and the color of the meat are not
implicated in the studies on the etiopathogenesis of food intolerances in dogs. On the other
hand, the risk increases with the quantity of meat ingested. A very red meat like venison is
very widely and successfully used as a basis for elimination diets.

Can atopic dermatitis be controlled
simply with PUFA supplementation?

Yes, but if the response is unsatisfactory after two months of treatment other therapeutics
should be used.

Can dietary imbalance create an
immune deficiency?

Only serious protein or fatty acid deficiencies can cause an immune deficiency. This has been
observed only in cases of debilitating diseases or serious chronic digestive problems.

The beauty of the coat obviously
depends on the genetic data selected
by the breeders, but these natural
qualities are only realized if the food
provides the nutrients essential
to growth and regeneration.

Key Points
to remember:

The role of nutrition in preventing
and treating skin diseases in dogs
Objective #1: strengthening the effectiveness of
the skin barrier
The Waltham Research Center has
screened 27 substances that are likely to have a beneficial effect on skin
barrier function. The selection criteria were based on limiting water loss
through the epidermis and the synthesis of skin lipids.
Four group B vitamins and one
amino acid acting synergistically
were identified (Watson et al, 2006).
Group B vitamins are water soluble
and are not stored in the body. In
general, a balanced diet and synthesis by the intestinal bacteria guarantee sufficient intake, although intake
can become marginal in situations of

88

major water loss or antibiotic treatment.
- Niacin (or nicotinamide) is synthesized from tryptophan. It is essential
for cellular respiration. With deficiency, pruriginous dermatitis of the
abdomen and the hind limbs occurs
in dogs (termed pellagra in human
medicine).
- Pantothenic acid is involved as a coenzyme in many metabolic pathways, including those of fatty acids.
- Choline and inositol work together
in the formation of cell membranes.
Combined with phosphorus, choline
forms phospholipids.
- Histidine is essential to the growth
and maturation of the epidermal
cells (keratinocytes).

Administration of these nutrients
has a beneficial effect after approximately two months, due to the time
needed for the epidermal cellular
differentiation process.

Objective #2: controlling
inflammation with
essential fatty acids
Some fatty acids are termed essential
because the organism is incapable of
synthesizing them. In the case of
deficiency, the skin undergoes major
desquamation with alterations in the
skin barrier function.

Dermatology

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

The essential fatty acids have a dual
action: they rebalance the composition of the superficial lipid film to
limit skin drying phenomena (Fray et
al, 2004) and they decrease the synthesis of inflammation mediators.
The anti-inflammatory properties of
long-chain omega 3 fatty acids
(EPA/DHA) are widely used in human
and veterinary dermatology (Byrne et
al, 2000).

Objective #3: ensuring
the vitamin intake meets
the major requirements
of the coat

The sensitivity of polyunsaturated
fatty acids to oxidation requires close
monitoring of their resistance to oxidation and an increase in the quantities of vitamin E in the food.

Vitamin A regulates the growth of
epidermal cells and the production
of sebum. It helps combat seborrhea
and the dandruff that often forms
after pruritus. It acts synergistically
with zinc and sulfated amino acids.

Biotin (vitamin H) is essential to skin
integrity. Biotin deficiency can lead
to mild or severe hair loss.

BORAGE OIL
B o r a g e
(Borago officinalis) is a plant from
Asia that is also
grown in North Africa
and various European
countries, including the
UK, Germany, France and the
Netherlands. The oil is obtained by
pressing the grains.

Borage oil is characterized by large
quantities of fatty acids, especially
those of the omega 6 family such as
gamma linolenic acid or GLA. Most
vegetable oils have high linoleic acid
content, but the only oils that provide significant quantities of GLA are:
borage oil, evening primrose oil and
blackcurrant seed oil. Of course,
borage oil contains the highest GLA
content.

The diagram below illustrates the
successive transformations linoleic
acid goes through to produce the
whole omega 6 fatty acid family.
Each step in the transformation is
characterized by the facilitation of a
specific enzyme.

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

The addition of GLA to the diet
favors the incorporation of GLA into
tissues including the liver, red blood
cells, and the vessel walls. The efficacy of this supplementation in the cell
membranes is much clearer than that
obtained from the transformation of
linolenic acid. The dietary intake of
GLA therefore prevents the risk of
deficiency in animals at highest risk

such as aging dogs or dogs suffering
from enzyme deficiencies.
Borage oil has potential for the
treatment of all inflammatory problems. The best studies into the
beneficial effects of borage oil have
been in dermatology. GLA supplementation favors an increase in the
production of hormones with well
known anti-inflammatory effects

(type 1 prostaglandins). This production is at the expense of the synthesis of type 2 prostaglandins, which
have a pro-inflammatory effect.
Decreasing the transformation of
arachidonic acid limits the negative
effects of its derivatives, type 2 prostaglandins and the excessive inflammatory phenomena associated with
them.

The positive effects are significant in
dogs presented with an inherited
predisposition. The results are also
promising with respect to problems
with excessive sebum production by
the skin (seborrhea).

Borage oil is also used in cosmetology where it is incorporated into products aimed at regenerating the
flexibility and elasticity of the skin. It
is indicated when the skin is dry.

astrointestinal problems are a major concern for smallanimal practitioners. Specifically chronic disorders of
the digestive tract can be difficult to manage because of the
limitations of the diagnostic procedures and the multiplicity
of possible causes. The current chapter summarizes the basic
facts on gastrointestinal physiology of dogs including the intestinal
microflora and the immune system. The most frequent digestive
disorders are presented in a problem orientated manner
including diagnostic aspects and medical and dietary treatment.
The role of dietetics is considered specifically for each
of the different types of disease considered.

The small intestine (SI) is the principal site for digestion and absorption of nutrients, and is key to
electrolyte and fluid absorption. The villi and microvilli contribute to the huge surface area, which
facilitates absorption and assimilation of nutrients. Enterocytes are highly specialized cells involved
in absorption processes. A brush border (or microvillus membrane; MVM) is present on the luminal surface of the enterocytes, and contains enzymes necessary for digestion of nutrients. Carrier proteins assist in the transport of amino acids, monosaccharides and electrolytes. The turnover of both
enterocytes and microvillar proteins is influenced by luminal factors such as pancreatic enzymes, bile
salts and bacteria.

Digestion and absorption of food
> Proteins

Protein digestion is initiated in the stomach by the enzyme pepsin. It is inactivated once it has
passed into the duodenum. Protein digestion in the small intestine is carried out by pancreatic
and MVM enzymes. Peptides and free amino acids are produced by the digestive processes and
small peptides and amino acids are absorbed by specific carriers in the MVM (Figure 1).

> Lipids

Dietary fats are emulsified by their interaction with bile acids in the small intestine, and subsequently digested by the pancreatic enzymes lipase, phospholipase and cholesterol esterase. Triglycerides are digested to monoglycerides and free fatty acids. In combination with bile acids, micelles
are formed enabling absorption as monoglycerides and free fatty acids (Figure 2). Bile acids are
reabsorbed by a specific carrier mechanism in the ileum, and then recycled by the liver. After
absorption, long-chain fatty acids are re-esterified to triglycerides, incorporated into chylomicrons
and then enter the lymphatics. Medium and short chain fatty acids were originally thought to be
absorbed directly into the portal circulation, but recent work has questioned this theory (Sigalet
et al, 1997).

FIGURE 3 - DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION OF CARBOHYDRATES

Starch is the major digestible polysaccharide in common food
and is degraded by pancreatic amylase to maltose. Maltose and
other dietary disaccharides (lactose and sucrose) are digested by
MVM enzymes to constituent monosaccharides, which are then
absorbed by specific transporters or by facilitated transport.
Monosaccharides are then transported across the basolateral
membrane into the portal circulation (Figure 3).

Macrominerals and trace elements are mainly absorbed from the

absorption processes. Active calcium absorption is subjected to
regulatory mechanisms that are mediated by vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and calcitonin. These homeostatic mechanisms allow the organism to adapt to the different dietary intakes

to regulatory mechanisms. Active transport systems have been demonstrated for manganese and

Lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) are dissolved in mixed micelles, and passively absorbed

Water-soluble vitamins, most notably B vitamins, are absorbed by passive diffusion, facilitated
transport or active transport. The absorptive mechanisms for folic acid and vitamin B12 are more
complicated, and summarized in Figure 4 and 5.

Intestinal microflora
The resident bacterial flora is an integral part of the healthy intestinal tract and influences development of microanatomy, aids in digestive processes, stimulates the development of the enteric
immune system, and can protect against pathogen invasion. Healthy individuals are immunologically tolerant of this stable flora, and loss of tolerance may contribute to the pathogenesis of
chronic enteropathies e.g. inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
The populations of bacterial flora quantitatively increase from the duodenum to colon, and are
regulated endogenously and by a number of factors, including intestinal motility, substrate availability, various bacteriostatic and bacteriocidic secretions (e.g. gastric acid, bile and pancreatic
secretions). A functional ileocolic valve is the anatomical barrier between the colonic and small
intestinal microflora. Abnormalities or dysfunction in any of these factors may lead to bacterial
flora abnormalities, which may be quantitative or qualitative.
The normal SI flora is a diverse mixture of aerobic, anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria.
The total upper small intestinal bacterial counts reported in humans is less than 103-5 CFU*/mL.
94

Role of the mucosal
immune system
The SI mucosa has a general barrier function, but
must also generate a protective immune response
against pathogens, whilst remaining ‘tolerant’ of
harmless environmental antigens such as commensal
bacteria and food. Yet despite recent advances in our
understanding of the structure of and interactions in
the immune system, it is still unclear as to how it
decides to respond to or become tolerant of a particular antigen.
The gastrointestinal tract harbors the largest number
of immune cells in the body. The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) consists of inductive and effector sites. Inductive sites comprise Peyer's patches, isolated lymphoid follicles, and the mesenteric lymph
nodes, whilst effector sites comprise the intestinal
lamina propria and epithelium.
Such a distinction, however, is not absolute, and there
is overlap between the functions of these different
sites. The population of immune cells is diverse and
includes T and B lymphocytes, plasma cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, eosinophils and mast cells.
Protective immune responses are critical for guarding
against pathogen invasion, and both cell-mediated
(synthesis of cytotoxic cells) and humoral (immunoglobulin production) responses can be produced.
However, of equal if not greater importance is maintenance of mucosal tolerance. This is not surprising,
given that the majority of luminal antigens are derived from innocent dietary components or endogenous microflora. Generation of active immune responses to such ubiquitous molecules is both wasteful
and potentially harmful, since it could lead to uncontrolled inflammation. Indeed, a break down in immunological tolerance to commensal bacteria is thought
to be a critical step in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.

Following ingestion, cobalamin is
released from dietary protein in the

binding proteins (e.g. ‘R-proteins’). In
the small intestine cobalamin transfers
onto intrinsic factor (IF), which is
synthesized by the pancreas.
Cobalamin-IF complexes pass along the
intestine until the distal small intestine,
where cobalamin is transported across
the mucosa and into the portal
circulation.

Digestion

1- Digestive tract physiology

There is currently no consensus as to what constitutes a ‘normal’ SI population in healthy dogs;
some studies suggest that healthy dogs can harbor up to 109 CFU/mL aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the proximal SI. Therefore, the ‘cut-off’ for normal flora in dogs cannot be extrapolated
from humans, and descriptions of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in dogs using a
cut-off value of 105 may be spurious. The intestinal microflora is subjected to endogenous and exogenous regulatory influences. Diet composition will impact the concentrations of bacteria in the
gut. High protein diets favor the growth of proteolytic bacteria, especially clostridia, while certain
fermentable fibers stimulate the saccharolytic bacteria, for instance bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.

2 - Oropharyngeal and esophageal diseases

Digestion

Whilst the mechanisms by which mucosal tolerance actually occurs have been well characterized, the fundamental question of how the GALT decides when to and when not to become tolerant remains unresolved. Nevertheless, the critical cell in generating tolerance is the CD4+ T-cell,
either by down-regulatory cytokine synthesis (e.g. TGF-β‚ or IL-10) or via cell-cell interactions
(e.g. through CD25+, the IL-2 receptor). Interestingly, the cytokines that mediate tolerance
(namely TGF-β‚ and IL-10) also facilitate IgA production, the most important mucosal immunoglobulin. Therefore, generation of mucosal tolerance could potentially occur in parallel to specific IgA responses. Interestingly, IgA ‘coats’ the mucosal surface and protects by immune exclusion (i.e. preventing antigens from crossing the mucosal barrier). Given that immune exclusion
limits the amount of antigen to which the mucosal immune system is exposed, its effect is also
‘tolerance-generating’ because it minimizes immune responsiveness.

2 - Oropharyngeal and
esophageal diseases
Swallowing disorders and diseases
of the esophagus
> Clinical signs associated with swallowing disorders

Dysphagia is defined as difficult or painful swallowing (odynophagia) and can result from conditions of the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus. The complete swallowing sequence involves oropharyngeal, esophageal and gastro-esophageal phases. The oropharyngeal phase can be further
subdivided into oral, pharyngeal and cricopharyngeal stages. Abnormalities of any of these stages
can result in dysphagia. Disorders are usually functional or morphological; most functional disorders are the result of failure, spasm or incoordination of the normal neuromuscular activity. Regurgitation is almost effortless expulsion of food from either the oropharynx or esophagus. This should
be differentiated from vomiting (Table 1).
The main clinical signs associated with swallowing disorders are listed in Table 2.

TABLE 2 - SIGNS OF SWALLOWING DISORDERS
Primary Signs

• Signalment and history
Breed, gender and age can all provide clues as to the likely diagnosis.
In this regard, young dogs are more likely to suffer from congenital
diseases. A thorough history is essential, in order to establish the pattern of clinical signs, in terms of duration, progression, frequency and
severity. Further clues as to the underlying etiology may be evident
e.g. ingestion of a foreign body.

Dysphagia
Odynophagia
Regurgitation
Polypnea may be present

• Physical examination

Secondary Signs
Malnutrition
Dehydration
Anorexia (pain, obstruction) or polyphagia (starvation)
Regurgitation
- reflux pharyngitis, rhinitis
- nasal discharge
Aspiration pneumonia
- cough, dyspnea
Tracheal compression
- cough, dyspnea

Physical examination is often normal although, if regurgitation is
severe, body condition may be poor. Diseases of the oral cavity can
often be directly visualized, but the pharynx and cricopharynx cannot be examined without sedation or general anesthesia. If the cervical esophagus is dilated, this
can often be palpated or visualized.

• Further diagnostic investigations
History and physical examination confirms signs consistent with a swallowing disorder, and may
give a clue as to the exact region involved (Table 3). However, a definitive diagnosis can rarely be
established at this stage and additional procedures are required.

2 - Oropharyngeal and esophageal diseases

Survey radiographs. Many swallowing disorders can be detected with plain radiography. A gas-filled
esophagus can be seen with megaesophagus, sometimes evident as a tracheal stripe sign. Most foreign bodies (especially bone material) are also evident with plain radiography.

• Barium esophagram ± fluoroscopy
In some cases contrast radiography is required, although this is unnecessary (and can even be dangerous e.g. inhalation of barium) if a diagnosis is evident on the plain radiograph. Barium mixed
with food is preferable for esophageal studies; iodine-based contrast agents should be used if perforation is suspected. If available, fluoroscopic analysis is preferable because it provides dynamic
information on oral cavity, pharyngeal and esophageal function. All swallowing phases can be examined and characterized.

• Endoscopy
This is not essential for many esophageal diseases e.g. megaesophagus, but is the method of choice for most other conditions. This procedure is also essential for diagnosis of all organic causes
(e.g. esophagitis – Figure 6 –, gastro-esophagal reflux, stenosis, esophagal neoplasia). Flexible
endoscopy is preferable to rigid endoscopy for viewing the esophagus. Endoscopy can also be therapeutic e.g. foreign body removal, esophageal stricture dilation, and placement of percutaneous
esophagostomy tubes.

These can result in disruption of any of the oropharyngeal stages of swallowing (oral, pharyngeal
or cricopharyngeal). Cricopharyngeal dysmotility can result either from failure of the cricopharynx
to contract (chalasia) or relax (achalasia). The etiology of these disorders is poorly understood, but
some cases are associated with neurological (brain stem disease, peripheral neuropathies), neuromuscular (myasthenia gravis, polymyositis) or metabolic (hypothyroidism) derangements. Cricopharyngeal achalasia is described in young dogs as a congenital failure.
Most of these disorders are treated medically. If a specific cause can be documented this should be
treated. Otherwise treatment is usually supportive e.g. nutritional support (via gastrostomy tube)
or postural feeding. If cricopharyngeal achalasia is present, this can be managed surgically e.g. by

> Megaesophagus and esophageal
dysmotility

Megaesophagus refers to esophageal global dilatation and dysfunction/paralysis, and has numerous
possible causes (Table 5). Pathogenesis is characterized by failure of progressive peristaltic waves.
Esophageal dysmotility is the term used to describe defective esophageal motility without overt
dilation of the esophagus (e.g. visible on radiography). The
same diseases that cause megaesophagus are also responsible for
TABLE 5 - MAJOR CAUSES OF MEGAESOPHAGUS
esophageal dysmotility. Megaesophagus can be primary or
secondary. The most important cause of acquired megaoeosPrimary / Idiopathic
Secondary
phagus is myasthenia gravis (MG). In focal MG, megaosophagus may be the only clinical sign.
The main clinical sign of megaesophagus is regurgitation
(without pain), and a dilated cervical esophagus may be seen.
Secondary signs (pyrexia, coughing, dyspnea, weight loss) may
also be present and are usually due to nasal reflux, inhalation
pneumonia, and malnutrition.

Congenital e.g.
- Great Dane, German
Shepherd, Irish Setter
(associated with pyloric
stenosis)
Acquired

Focal or general myasthenia gravis
Other neurological disorders
- Polymyositis
- Polyneuropathies
- Dysautonomia
- Bilateral vagal nerve damage
- Brain stem disease
• Trauma
• Neoplasia
• Vascular disease
• Botulism
• Distemper
• Dysautonomia
• Tetanus
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

There is no effective medical or surgical therapy for idiopathic
megaesophagus and all methods are supportive (see below). For
secondary megaesophagus, treatment involves treating the
underlying cause. Examples include using steroid replacement
for hypoadrenocorticism, and using a combination of anticholinesterases (e.g. pyridostigmine) and immunosuppressive medication (glucocorticoids, azathioprine, mycophenolate or cyclosporin) to treat MG.

Toxicity
- Lead
- Thallium
- Anticholinesterase
- Acrylamide

There is always a danger of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia and, therefore, prognosis is guarded. However, some idiopathic cases in young dogs recover spontaneously, whilst recovery of function occasionally occurs in secondary megaesophagus
if the underlying cause is treated.

Various
- Mediastinitis
- Hypoadrenocorticism
- Pituitary dwarfism
- Esophagitis
- Hiatal hernia
- Hypothyroidism (controversial)

> Esophagitis and esophageal ulceration

Esophagitis is defined as inflammation of the esophagus, and has
a number of potential causes (Table 6). Ulceration (and subsequent stricture formation) can develop if esophagitis is severe.

2 - Oropharyngeal and esophageal diseases

Digestion

Clinical signs of esophagitis include chronic vomiting/regurgitation, hypersalivation and anorexia
due to the pain associated with swallowing. Endoscopy is advisable and the stomach and the duodenum should be examined if chronic vomiting is present.
Treatment is symptomatic. In addition to nutritional support (see below), attention must be given
to providing adequate fluid therapy. Recommended drug therapy includes the use of broad-spectrum antibacterials, analgesics, mucosal protectants (sucralfate), gastric acid blockers (e.g. H2 antagonists such as ranitidine, famotidine, or proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole), and motility modifiers e.g. metoclopramide.
> Esophageal obstruction

Esophageal obstruction can be intraluminal, intramural or extramural, and can be partial or complete (Table 7). If the obstruction is long-standing, the esophagus cranial to the obstruction can

become dilated and hypomotile. Other complications of esophageal obstruction include esophagitis and esophageal rupture leading to mediastinitis (not often described in dogs).
Esophageal strictures are the result of luminal narrowing caused by fibrosis. The fibrosis develops
in the healing phase after esophageal ulceration, which is in turn caused by foreign bodies, ingestion of caustic material, esophageal burns (from ingestion of hot foodstuffs), diseases that cause
esophagitis, gastric reflux (most common after general anaesthesia), and drug therapy (e.g. doxycycline). The diagnostic approach described above is applicable to esophageal strictures, with esophageal contrast studies and endoscopy most applicable.
Treatment involves widening dilation of the stricture, either by balloon dilation or bougienage.
Nutritional support is often required during the period of therapeutic dilations (see below).
Esophageal foreign bodies are relatively common in dogs and types include bones, needles, wood
and fish-hooks. Foreign bodies occur most commonly in young animals, and Terrier breeds (e.g.
West Highland White Terrier) are predisposed. Clinical signs are usually acute in onset and include
dysphagia, regurgitation, ptyalism and anorexia (if the presence of the foreign body causes pain).

100

The majority of esophageal foreign bodies can be removed, perorally, under endoscopic guidance.
On rare occasions, surgical esophagostomy is required to remove the foreign body, but this should
be a last resort. Again nutritional support may be required during the convalescent phase (see
below). If lesions are severe, a percutaneous gastrostomy tube (PEG) must be placed.
Vascular ring anomalies (VRA) are congenital malformations of the aortic arches, and constrict
the esophagus at the level of the heart base. The esophagus cranial to the obstruction can then
become dilated and aperistaltic. VRA are most common in Irish Setters and German Shepherds
(e.g. same as for idiopathic megaesophagus).
Clinical signs include acute onset of regurgitation and poor weight gain, and are usually first noted
at the timing of weaning (e.g. when solids are administered for the first time). Contrast radiographic studies are the best methods of diagnosis.
Surgical management is the treatment of choice, but success depends upon how longstanding the
problem is. The more delayed the presentation, the greater the size of the associated esophageal
dilatation and the less likely the signs are to resolve. Given that these animals are often poorly
grown, nutritional support is required to improve condition prior to surgery (see below). The prognosis is guarded; these patients are at poor surgical risk due to malnutrition and the potential for
aspiration pneumonia. Further, the esophageal cranial dilatation may persist despite correction of
the VRA.
> Hiatal hernia

A hiatal hernia is a herniation of part or all of the gastresophageal junction and stomach through
the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm into the thorax. The condition can sometimes be exacerbated by increased inspiratory effort due to upper airway obstruction (e.g. laryngeal paralysis). The most severe, but thankfully rare,
form is the gastro-esophageal intussusception, which occurs in young
dogs with a breed predisposition for Shar-pei dogs. Clinical signs
include acute onset of vomiting, regurgitation and dyspnea, leading
to shock and death. Paraesophageal hernia involves herniation of the
stomach parallel to the esophagus. Sliding hiatal hernia often presents in an intermittent fashion.

Shar-pei puppies present a breed
predisposition for gastro-esophageal
intussusception.

Fluoroscopy or endoscopy may be required to demonstrate the problem but, unless the hernia develops during visualization, it is often
missed. Repeated evaluation may be required. This type of hernia
may cause reflux esophagitis intermittent regurgitation and vomiting.

© Badeau

Many hernias can be successfully managed medically with modification of feeding behavior (small frequent meals, upright feeding) and
drugs to treat associated reflux esophagitis. Surgical management is
required for intussusception or persistent herniation.

Digestion

2 - Oropharyngeal and esophageal diseases

If obstruction is incomplete, ingestion of liquids but not solids is tolerated and there may be a
delay before the animal is presented to the veterinarian. If perforation is present, mediastinitis can
develop leading to signs of depression and pyrexia. A combination of plain radiography and esophagoscopy are suitable to make the diagnosis. Contrast studies are rarely required; barium may
mask the foreign body and it should be avoided if perforation is suspected.

2 - Oropharyngeal and esophageal diseases

Digestion

> Esophageal neoplasia

Esophageal neoplasia is a rare cause of progressive regurgitation, often with blood. It has been
reported to be associated with hypertrophic osteopathy (Marie’s disease). The most common types
of neoplasia in dogs include smooth muscle tumors, carcinoma, fibrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma
(which is associated with Spirocerca lupi infection especially in South America, Africa or La Reunion Island). Esophageal neoplasia is invariably malignant, treatment options are limited and prognosis is grave (because the diagnosis is usually made too late).
> Esophageal diverticula
Feeding from a height helps swallowing
in esophageal disease.

Esophageal diverticula are focal dilatations of the esophageal wall, and can either be congenital
or can arise secondary to other esophageal diseases. Two types are described:
- Pulsion diverticula. These occur cranial to an esophageal lesion e.g. vascular ring anomalies.
- Traction diverticula. These develop as a result of inflammation and fibrosis within the esophagus, which distracts the esophagus causing a diverticulum.

Diverticula must be differentiated from esophageal redundancy e.g. kinking of the esophagus seen
in young brachycephalic breeds and Shar-pei dogs. Diagnosis is made with radiography (+/- barium
studies). Small diverticula rarely cause a problem, and conservative treatment is appropriate (e.g.
soft diet fed from an upright position). Larger (multilobulated) diverticula are more problematic
and may require surgery, although prognosis is poor.

NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT OF SWALLOWING DISORDERS
Feeding from a height. Food and water
bowls can be placed in a high place. Small
dogs can be fed ‘over-the shoulder’. These
patients can also be held vertical for a short
while after feeding to encourage passage of
food to stomach (Guilford & Matz 2003). In
patients that tolerate liquids poorly, fluid
requirements can be fulfilled with ice cubes
Alter food consistency. The optimum type of
food varies between cases. For some, liquidized
high quality diets are best, for others, wet
food or moisturized dry food is suitable.
Diet viscosity should also be considered.
Diets may be applied either by syringe
or as small solid boluses depending on
the underlying disease or the preference
of the patient or of the owner.
Ensure adequate nutrient intake.
Patients with swallowing disorders need
to be fed for shorter or longer times and
depending on the duration of the disease
the intake of fluid, energy and nutrients
has to be balanced.

102

Ideally, the diet should deliver all required
nutrients in a reasonable volume.
To maintain the energy balance of the patient,
high fat diets are preferred because these diets
provide high energy density so that the
patients’ energy requirements can be met
in a smaller volume of food.
Assisted feeding e.g. gastrostomy tube see Chapter 14. For many diseases (e.g.
esophageal stricture and esophageal ulceration), a period of assisted feeding is required
whilst the primary disease is treated. Short to
medium term assisted feeding can sometimes
be of benefit in patients with megaesophagus,
since it enables improvements in body
condition and gives the patient time to adjust
to alterations in oral feeding (Marks et al. 2000;
Devitt et al. 2000; Sanderson et al. 2000).
Many owners readily accept to feed their dogs
with feeding tubes.

Swallowing disorders and esophageal
diseases are a significant problem for the
affected individual, however, they occur
less frequently in practice compared to the
disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.
Acute and chronic diseases of the stomach,
the small and large intestine are of major
practical significance and require thorough
clinical workup of the patient to avoid misleading diagnosis and treatment.

Acute gastroenteritis is a common reason for owners to seek veterinary advice; classification
is shown in Tables 8 and 9. At the time of initial presentation, the veterinarian must quickly make
a number of decisions about diagnosis and treatment (Tables 10 and 11).

TABLE 12 - HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
FOR ACUTE CASES OF GI DISEASE
Physical examination. Relevant findings
on physical examination include:

History. Relevant historical findings include:
• Age and vaccination status
• Recent dietary history
• Concurrent drug therapy
• Possible exposure to toxins, plants, foreign bodies or
infectious disease
• Nature of signs e.g.
- onset and severity
- content of vomitus
- stool characteristics
-presence of blood (hematemesis,
melena, hematochezia)

• General body condition
• Hydration status (may also require PCV/TP)
• Oral examination - mucous membranes etc.
• Rectal examination
• Abdominal palpation

Clinical signs usually include a combination of vomiting and diarrhea, the latter of which may
have either small or large intestinal characteristics (depending on the region of the gastrointestinal tract affected). Other clinical signs include appetite changes, abdominal pain and tenesmus.
For non-fulminating cases, history and physical examination are sufficient to allow an appropriate
treatment to be formulated (Table 12). Based on this preliminary information, the decisionmaking process can commence. In some cases further diagnostics will be required (Table 13).
For cases that present as emergencies, with acute or peracute clinical signs diagnostic investigations should be performed in parallel to preliminary treatment to stabilize the condition of the
patient. It is advisable to run an emergency database to allow decisions to be made about preliminary treatment (especially fluid therapy) (Table 11).

Hematology, serum biochemistry and urinalysis
Fecal examinations for parasites
Bacteriology. Bacterial culture is indicated if:
- Febrile
- Inflammatory leukogram / rectal cytology
- GI bleeding
- Young animal?
PCR for enteropathogenic E. coli?
Virology
- Fecal examination, e.g. ELISA test for viral antigen (e.g. parvovirus) or electron microscopy (e.g. rotavirus,
coronavirus)
- Serology. Paired samples required to demonstrate recent infection.
Imaging
- Plain radiographs are helpful to rule out gastrointestinal obstruction and other surgical diseases.
- Abdominal ultrasonography is also useful for this purpose.
Response to empirical treatment
Diagnosis can be confirmed by response to any of the following therapies:
- Dietary restriction
- Discontinuation of drugs
- Avoidance of plants or other environmental agents
- Anti-emetics
- Anti-diarrheals
- Parasiticides

104

If a primary cause can be identified this should be treated (e.g. antibacterials for infectious diarrhea). However, in most cases a cause is not obvious; nevertheless most will improve spontaneously
in 2-3 days, suggesting that treatment is not always necessary. Prognosis for complete recovery is
usually good. However, the animal should be reassessed if:
- Clinical signs persist for >48 hours, despite symptomatic treatment
- Clinical signs are deteriorating.

The mainstay of therapy is dietary management. Concurrent drug therapy is often prescribed empirically (Table 14). Antimicrobials are often prescribed but have only occasional true indications
(Table 15).

3 - Acute gastrointestinal diseases

Treatment

The mainstay of therapy for acute
gastrointestinal disease is dietary management.
Two major approaches exist:

Milk and milk products should be limited due to
their high lactose concentration.
An alternative would be to use a proprietary
food with low-fat concentration and a high
digestibility.

1.“Resting the gut” i.e. restricted oral
intake
If the patient is vomiting water, is dehydrated, or
there is evidence of an electrolyte/acid-base disturbance, the patient should be maintained nil
per os (NPO) and parenteral fluids should be
administered (Marks et al 2000; Devitt, et al
2000; Sanderson et al 2000). Suitable choices
would include Hartmann's or 0.9% saline
(both ± 10 mM/L KCl).

The fiber content of diets for patients with acute
intestinal problems should be limited to ensure
high digestibility. Due to the expected losses
of electrolytes the dietary levels of potassium,
sodium and chloride should be increased.
Assuming clinical signs resolve, the normal diet
can be reintroduced gradually over 3-5 days.

If the patient is not vomiting, oral glucoseelectrolyte rehydration solutions can be
administered. However, parenteral fluids should
be administered if evidence of dehydration exists
(>5%) or if the patient is exhausted or refuses
to drink.
In both cases the animal should be fasted, i.e.
food should be withheld for at least 24 hours.
The patient should then be given frequent small,
bland, low-fat meals for 24-72 hours. Examples
would include boiled 1 part rice or pasta with
1 part boiled lean meat (chicken or turkey),
eggs or low-fat cottage cheese.

2. “Feeding through diarrhea”
An alternative approach is to continue to feed
the animal despite the clinical signs. Such
an approach has been adopted for diarrhea
in human infants, and may speed recovery.
Further, there is preliminary evidence in dogs
with parvovirus that such an approach may
reduce morbidity (Mohr et al, 2003). However,
it is less practicable if vomiting is persistent
or if diarrhea is profuse.

A certain risk may exist because the
gastrointestinal tract is likely to have altered
permeability that allows easier passage of
dietary antigens. Therefore, the patient may be
at risk of developing a hypersensitivity to the
dietary proteins used in the enteral diet. It is
often recommended to use a protein source
that is not part of the normal diet
(sacrificial protein).

Digestion

DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES

Enteral nutrition was associated with
a shorter time to recovery, increased body
weight gain, and improved gut barrier
function in puppies with parvo-viral enteritis,
compared to nil per os (Mohr et al, 2003).

4 - Chronic diseases of the stomach
Chronic diseases of the stomach result in a number of clinical signs (Table 16), the most important of which is vomiting. Causes of vomiting include gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal
diseases (Table 17). There are two main mechanisms that cause gastric vomiting: gastric outflow
obstruction, gastroparesis and disruption of the mucosal barrier (Table 18). Hematemesis is defined as vomiting blood. It usually results from the presence of gastric or gastro-duodenal ulceration. Blood can be fresh or partially digested blood (“coffee grounds”).

Diagnosis of gastric disease
The approach to the chronically vomiting patient depends upon the exact nature of the clinical
signs. It is important to distinguish vomiting from regurgitation at an early stage (Table 1), if
possible by examining the act of vomition and/or the vomitus. Secondary causes of vomiting
(metabolic, toxic) should then be eliminated with laboratory analyses (hematology, serum biochemistry, urinalysis) and diagnostic imaging. Contrast radiography is occasionally useful although
most abnormalities can be seen on a survey radiograph. Gastroscopy (or exploratory laparotomy)
and biopsy is necessary in most cases of gastric disease. This allows inspection of the gastric
mucosa, biopsy procurement (which should be performed even if grossly normal as it is on Figure
7), and foreign body removal (where applicable).

Specific causes of chronic gastritis
(± chronic enterocolitis)
The etiology of chronic gastritis is usually unknown, but possible causes include:
- Immune mediated
- Part of generalized inflammatory bowel disease
- Secondary to other metabolic diseases (chronic renal insufficiency, hepatic diseases, pancreatitis)
- Gastric spiral bacteria (Helicobacter) (controversial)
Laboratory changes are uncommon and/or often non-specific. Gastroscopy and biopsy is required
for definitive diagnosis.
Treatment modalities include:
1. Dietary management
2. Removal of the etiological agent if known
3. Corticosteroids for some cases, especially if this forms part of a more generalized IBD, and only
after biopsy samples have been analyzed.
4. H2 antagonists and/or proton pump inhibitors
5. Motility modifiers e.g. metoclopramide, ranitidine and erythromycin.
6. 'Triple therapy' for spiral bacteria.
> Anatomical outflow obstruction

Gastric outflow obstruction can have a number of causes including pyloric disease, foreign body
and neoplasia. Pyloric stenosis can be congenital (e.g. brachycephalic breeds) or acquired. Surgical treatment is necessary e.g. pyloroplasty or pyloromyotomy. Pylorospasm is a functional rather
than structural disorder. The cause is likely related to a gastric motility disorder. Foreign bodies
(e.g. balls, peach stones, horse chestnuts, wine corks) can cause intermittent obstruction in a ‘ballcock’ manner. Other common pyloric diseases include polyp and chronic hypertrophic pyloric gastropathy (CHPG; reported in toy breeds).
> Delayed gastric emptying

DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC GASTRITIS
Patients with chronic gastritis should be fed multiple
small feeds. Wet food should be warmed to body temperature.
Dilution with water is often necessary and helps
to reduce osmolality. Liquid low osmotic diets facilitate
gastric emptying.
Diets must be highly digestible, reduced in fat (lower by
at least 10% fat DMB, then increased depending on the
individuals’ tolerance), and should have a low fiber content
(<3% crude fiber DMB or 6% total dietary fiber DMB).
All of these factors help to increase the rate
of gastric emptying.

This is defined as vomiting following retention of food within the stomach for more than eight hours. Clinical signs include chronic vomiting, which is usually delayed, whilst gastric distension may also be seen.
Diagnosis can be inferred from clinical signs, but is confirmed with
contrast radiography. Gastroduodenoscopy is also indicated to rule out
other causes or define an underlying cause; exploratory laparotomy, may
also be diagnostic and may or may not be necessary for treatment.
The underlying etiology may be a primary motility disorder, e.g. dysynergy between antral and pyloric motility, or secondary e.g. delayed
motility resulting from inflammatory disease in the GI tract. Motility
modifiers (e.g. metoclopramide, cisapride, ranitidine and erythromycin) can be used to increase the speed of gastric emptying. Surgery can
be used as last resort (e.g. pyloromyotomy), and may benefit some cases.
Dietary management may also be helpful as adjunctive therapy e.g.
low-fat, low-fiber easily digestible food, fed in small frequent meals.
> Gastric ulceration

The causes of gastric ulceration are presented in Table 19. Clinical
signs include hematemesis, melena, anemia, weight loss, pain (may
demonstrate ‘praying posture’) (Figure 8), and signs of peritonitis (if
the ulcer perforates). Treatment for gastric ulceration involves correc108

> Gastric neoplasia

Primary neoplasia occurs infrequently in companion animals, and usually occurs in dogs more than
cats. Furthermore older male dogs are often predisposed. Adenocarcinoma (75%), lymphoma,

TABLE 19 - CAUSES OF GASTRIC ULCERATION
Drugs
• NSAIDs
• Corticosteroids*
• Cytotoxics
Cranial and spinal injuries
• Usually in combination with corticosteroid use
• Can also cause colonic
ulcers/perforation
Metabolic
• Liver disease
- Portal hypertension
- Coagulation disorder
• Uremia
• Hypoadrenocorticism
Severe gastritis
Sharp/abrasive gastric foreign bodies
Mast cell tumor
• Histamine release, gastric hypersecretion
and then ulceration

* On their own, corticosteroids are not
typically ulcerogenic - even high (immunosuppressive) doses rarely cause any problems. However, steroids can exacerbate
ulceration in a number of circumstances:
- If used in conjunction with NSAIDs
- If high doses are given to patients with
spinal disease (mechanism unknown)
- In the presence of 'mucosal hypoxia'
e.g. secondary to severe anemia.
- Another reason for a mucosa prone
to injury e.g. primary hemostatic
disorder such as immune-mediated
thrombocytopenia.
- A concurrent disease which also
increases the risk of GI ulceration
e.g. mast cell tumor, gastrinoma,
hypoadrenocorticism, liver disease,
renal disease, hypovolemia/shock etc.

Gastric spiral bacteria
Gastrinoma

lymphosarcoma, leiomyoma and polyps are the most common gastric tumors in
dogs. Response to treatment (e.g. chemotherapy) is usually poor, and most
will have metastasized by the time of diagnosis. Prognosis is poor.
> Bilious Vomiting Syndrome

The pathogenesis of this condition is poorly understood. It is thought
to result from a combination of reflux of bile into the stomach and
impaired gastric motility resulting in prolonged exposure of the gastric
mucosa to bile. This causes a local gastritis and vomiting, usually in the early morning e.g. after a prolonged period without food.

Figure 8 “Praying posture”.

Most diagnostic investigations are unremarkable. Treatment involves altering the pattern of feeding e.g. increasing the frequency of feeding to 2-3 times daily, with one of these meals administered last thing at night. Prokinetic drugs (metoclopramide, ranitidine) can also be of benefit
in some cases.

109

Digestion

ting the underlying cause if identified. Medical management involves the use of acid blocking
agents (H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors), gastric mucosal protectants (sucralfate), and synthetic prostaglandin analogues (misoprostol). Dietary management is designed to
facilitate emptying from the stomach and minimize retention of contents within the gastric
lumen. The dietary content should be optimal to assist the healing processes.

Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) is a sudden, dramatic and often fatal disorder. Overall mortality of up to 30% has been reported in some studies. Older dogs are most commonly affected,
although GDV can potentially affect dogs of any age. The most important risk factor is body
conformation and, in this regard, a narrow deep chest is associated with increased risk (Glickman
et al, 1994). Although many studies have incriminated diet (e.g. ingestion of dry, cereal based
foodstuffs), no clear association has been proven. Other potential incriminating factors include
single large meals, overeating, small kibble size, elevated feeding bowls, post-prandial exercise,
anesthesia, aerophagia, and previous gastric ‘injury’.

© Psaila

Feeding from a height is a risk
factor for gastric dilatation
and volvulus in high-risk dogs
(Glickman et al, 2000).

Gastric dilatation is the rapid distension of the stomach with food, fluid or air, and can rapidly
progress to volvulus (e.g. rotation of the stomach along its long-axis). Rapid gastric dilation affects
lower esophageal function, and impairs gastric motility and emptying. The gastric mucosa can
later undergo ischaemic necrosis. Accumulation of gastric secretions and occlusion of venous
return from the caudal body can lead to hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock. Splenic torsion with
infarction is another common sequel.

Large kibbles (30 mm x 30 mm
x 20 mm) help prevent aerophagia.
Aerophagia increases the risk of gastric
dilatation and volvulus
(Theyse et al, 2000).

Gastric dilatation and volvulus
particularly affects large breeds with
a deep chest (St Bernards, Great Danes,
Weimaraners, Gordon Setters, Irish
Setters and Standard Poodles).

Digestion

5 - Gastric dilatation-volvulus

Most animals present with a history of progressive (often rapid) abdominal distension, non-productive retching/vomiting, and hypersalivation. On physical examination gastric tympany is
usually obvious, but absence of clear symptoms does not exclude the possibility of a dilatation/volvulus of the stomach. Treatment involves emergency stabilization with aggressive intravenous fluid
therapy, and gastric decompression (ideally by gastric intubation). If appropriate, corrective surgery (e.g. gastropexy)
should be performed once the animal is stable (ideally
within the first 3-6 hours). Other adjunctive treatments
(many post-operatively) include antibacterials, H2 antagonists, sucralfate, intravenous fluid therapy, gastric intubation, lavage and decompression, and anti-arrhythmics (if
appropriate).

DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF GDV
The dietary risk factors for the development of
gastric dilatation and volvulus are not clear. In
addition, there are no studies available on
the dietary effects that would help to prevent
gastric dilatation in predisposed dogs. Data
available from clinical cases demonstrate
increased microbial fermentation in the stomach
of affected dogs with the accumulation of
bacterial fermentation products (gas, lactic acid,
volatile fatty acids) (Van Kruiningen et al. 1974;
Rogolsky et al, 1978). Gas composition in clinical
patients was similar to atmospheric air,
indicating that aerophagia could be a significant
factor in the pathogenesis of the disease
(Caywood et al, 1977).
The stomach content of dogs is physiologically
colonized with a large number and variety of
microorganisms (Benno et al, 1992a-1992b).
Imbalance in the bacterial flora e.g. increased
numbers of clostridia have been considered

110

as one potential factor in the etiology of the
disease. However, in one study comparing
diseased and healthy dogs the authors were
unable to demonstrate differences in the
clostridial colonization of the stomach of
these dogs (Warner et al, 1978).
Although the pathogenesis is not yet understood, it is justified to recommend certain dietary
measures.
• Dogs at risk should be fed three small meals
and not one single meal a day (Raghavan et al,
2004).
• Owners should be advised not to use elevated
feeding bowels as this appears to be a risk
factor for GDV.
• Food and feeding hygiene should not be
ignored. Food bowls should be regularly
cleaned and food should not be stored for
excessive periods, especially when it is
mixed with water.

• Owners of affected dogs should be advised to
feed the dogs as regularly as possible because
this consistency conditions the secretory and
digestive functions of the gastrointestinal tract
• Stress should be avoided after food intake,
because it can have negative effects on gastric
secretion (avoid exercise post-feeding)
• Diets for dogs at risk of developing gastric
dilatation and volvulus should not contain
elevated mineral levels. Minerals have a high
buffering capacity and may maintain the
gastric pH at higher levels which allows the
microorganisms to be more active compared
to an acidic environment
• Fat and especially unsaturated fatty acids have
a capacity to reduce microbial fermentation.
Although not experimentally proven it seems
to be advisable to feed patients at risk of GDV
with diets containing higher fat levels (Meyer
& Zentek, 2001).

Diseases that affect the intestinal tract can cause a range of clinical signs (Table 20). Diarrhea is
the most common clinical signs and is defined as an increase in fecal water content with an accompanying increase in the frequency, fluidity or volume of feces.
Diarrhea may be due to SI, large intestinal (LI) or diffuse disease. Chronic diarrhea is rarely selflimiting and, in order to administer rational therapy, a definitive diagnosis is required. Diarrhea
may be the result of a number of pathogenetic mechanisms (Table 21).

• Weight loss

TABLE 21 - PATHOGENETIC MECHANISMS OF DIARRHEA
• Lack of pancreatic enzymes e.g. exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
• Impaired micelle formation which could be the result of:
- Decreased bile salt formation as a result
of severe parenchymal liver disease
- Decreased bile salt delivery as a result of cholestatic
liver disease or bile duct obstruction
- Increased intestinal bile salt loss e.g. as a result of ileal disease (or SIBO – see below)
• Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth which then causes:
- Fatty acid hydroxylation leading to hydroxy-fatty acid formation
which then stimulates colonic secretion.
- Bile salt deconjugation which causes fat malabsorption
and colonic secretion
• Villus atrophy which causes diarrhea because:
- A decreased surface area is available for absorption
- Immature enterocytes are present which have lower
expression of brush border enzymes and carriers
• Inflammatory infiltration (NB also neoplastic or amyloid). This leads to:
- Obstruction of nutrient uptake
- Interference with enterocyte function
- Impaired lymphatic flow
• Impaired lymphatic drainage e.g. lymphangiectasia
• Abnormal motility (which is often secondary to another process e.g. inflammatory disease).
This then causes hypermotility or hypomotility and lack of segmentation.

Diagnosis of chronic intestinal diseases
A staged approach to diagnosis is usually recommended (Table 22).
• First, the diarrhea is defined as either small or large intestinal (Table 23)
• Intestinal parasitism is excluded (with fecal analyses)
• Empirical therapies are often used.
When a definitive cause has not been established, or cases do not respond, further diagnostics are
justified (Table 22) including laboratory analyses (hematology, serum biochemistry, multiple fecal
samples), diagnostic imaging and ultimately biopsy procurement.

TABLE 22 - APPROACH TO CHRONIC DIARRHEA
Stage 1

• Exclusion of dietary problems
(e.g. by dietary modification)
• Localization to SI or LI (or both) using history
and physical exam (especially abdominal and
rectal digital palpation)
• Fecal exam and rectal cytology
• Attempt response to therapy e.g. antiparasiticides to eliminate the possibility of:
Roundworms, whipworms and hookworms
which can be treated with:
- Fenbendazole
- Febantel
- Nitroscanate
Giardia
- Fenbendazole (50 mg/kg q 24 h for 3 days)
- [Albendazole, but toxicity]
- Febantel - requires 3-5 days of treatment.
- Metronidazole (25 mg/kg q 12 h for
5 days)
Many cases are resolved in this stage,
and don't need in-depth workup.

112

Stage 2

• Initially preliminary laboratory tests should
be performed e.g. hematology, serum biochemistry
and urinalysis. These rarely give a definitive diagnosis,
but rule out the presence of systemic disease.
• A definitive etiological/histopathological diagnosis
is usually made via an extended database of:
- Digestion and absorption tests
- Diagnostic imaging (which often guides which
method of biopsy is chosen)
- Plain and contrast radiography
- Ultrasound
- Biopsy, either:
- Exploratory laparotomy [always take biopsies,
even if grossly normal]
- Gastroduodenoscopy (depends on the expertise
of the operator) by flexible endoscopy (e.g. fiberoptic or video). Both the stomach and
duodenum should be examined
- Colonoscopy by flexible endoscopy to allow the
examination of the ileo-coecal valvula. This requires
prior preparation with prepare with warm water
enemas or oral cleanser.

It is important to rule out EPI prior to more detailed
investigations.

Specific small intestinal conditions
> Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)
and Antibiotic-Responsive Diarrhea (ARD)

SIBO is defined as an increased number of bacteria in the upper small intestine, and
is the cause of much recent controversy. SIBO is well documented in humans and
almost invariably develops secondary to an underlying cause.

Diagnosis for secondary SIBO involves identifying the underlying cause; none of the
currently available tests are ideal for the diagnosis of idiopathic ARD, and diagnosis
is based upon exclusion of all other causes and response to antibacterial therapy. Secondary SIBO
is best controlled by treating the underlying cause (if possible), though antibacterials may be required if response is suboptimal. Long courses (and some times lifelong) antibacterials is the mainstay
of treatment for ARD. Other medical therapies include parenteral cobalamin supplementation, if
cobalamin deficiency is identified.

Therefore, it should be viewed more as a sign than a specific diagnosis. Recently, the
term secondary SIBO has been used for cases which arise as a result of an underlying
disorder e.g. partial obstruction, EPI, motility disorder, reduced gastric acid production (gastric surgery, gastric achlorhydria or drug therapy with antacids), and possibly,
IBD. The previously described ‘idiopathic SIBO’ is now more commonly referred to
as ‘antibiotic-responsive diarrhea ’, given the uncertainty as to the underlying pathogenesis. This occurs in young dogs (especially German Shepherds) with a predominance
of small intestinal diarrhea and weight loss/stunting. The clinical signs are antibiotic
responsive.

German Shepherds show a breed
predisposition for idiopathic antibioticresponsive diarrhea.

Digestion

• Dietary management of SIBO/ARD
In light of the unknown etiology of the disease, dietary treatment should be considered adjunctive
rather than definitive therapy. The diet should have a high digestibility, so that can be effectively
absorbed and utilized by the dog. High digestibility supports the patient by providing available
nutrients, and reduces the potential load of antigenic material. By providing highly digestible diets,
the flux of nutrients into the colon is reduced. These nutrients would be utilized
by the colonic microflora with negative effects as gas formation, flatulence and
diarrhea. In cases where dietary sensitivity or allergy cannot be excluded, an
antigen-limited hypoallergenic diet is recommended. The diet can either
contain a highly digestible protein source (e.g. chicken, fish, and wheat gluten)
or any other highly digestible meats not normally used in commercial diets
(e.g.rabbit, venison). Alternatively, a hydrolyzed protein diet may be suitable.
Even in cases that are not etiologically linked with allergy or sensitivity a high
digestible diet can be expected to support the patient.

Psyllium grains are a source of non
fermentable, soluble fiber with a strong
hygroscopic power. These benefits
are very useful for regulating
intestinal transit in diarrhea
or constipation.

Diets for patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth should contain
carbohydrate sources that are highly digestible in the small intestine. Most carbohydrate sources will fulfill the requirements as long as the starch is adequately processed by thermal treatment (cooking, extrusion). Rice is the cereal
that contains the lowest level of fiber and it is considered as the most digestible starch source
(Figure 9).
The concentration of dietary fiber has to be adjusted according to the requirements of the patient.
Usually it is recommended to start with a low fiber type of diet (<3% crude fiber or 6% total dietary fiber DMB). Depending on the clinical outcome, it may be necessary to increase the fiber
concentration by adding small amounts of insoluble or soluble fiber sources. Adequate feedstuffs
are small amounts of cellulose, carrots, beet pulp or psyllium. (See Chapter 1 for more on dietary
fiber.)
It may be advisable to adjust energy intake according to the needs of the patient. Many patients
with small intestinal digestive problems suffer from malabsorption and resulting deficiencies.
Weight loss and poor coat and skin quality are major problems that must be treated by increasing
the density of certain nutrients in the diet. Fat concentration in a diet for patients with small
intestinal disease has to be considered from two sides.
• On the one hand, fat can be used
effectively to increase dietary energy
density.

• On the other hand fat can induce problems (due to the bacterial conversion
of non absorbed fatty acids and bile
acids into hydroxylated fatty acids and

that may cause hypersecretion and
aggravate clinical signs of diarrhea.

• Role of probiotics and prebiotics
Probiotics and prebiotics have been suggested as treatment options for patients with intestinal
problems.
A probiotic is a living organism that is administered orally, and exerts health benefits beyond those
of inherent basic nutrition. In theory they are 'beneficial' bacteria that colonize the intestine at
the expense of harmful bacteria. Their exact mechanism of action is not known and the identification of suitable bacteria for dogs is still in progress. However, two strains have been recently
approved by the European authorities as feed additives in complete dog food: Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enterococcus faecium. A probiotic containing a strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus was
successfully incorporated into canine diets, and improved recovery from clinical Campylobacter
infection (Baillon et al, 2004). More work would be required to determine whether there would
be similar effects in SIBO/ARD.
Prebiotics are substrates for 'beneficial' bacterial species, which cause alterations in the luminal
microflora. The aim is to offer a substrate to certain beneficial members of the gut flora and by this
to achieve a shift in the composition of the gut bacteria in favor of a “healthy” flora. Therefore,
they work in a similar or supportive way to probiotics. Prebiotics are non-digestible carbohydrates
that can be used by several gut bacteria. Lactulose and certain types of dietary fiber with moderate bacterial fermentability can be used. Examples include several carbohydrates with different
chain length: inulin and different oligosaccharides (fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides, mannan-oligosaccharides). There is currently no convincing evidence that such feed additives and feed compounds are beneficial in dogs with SIBO/ARD, and further work is required
before their use can be recommended (Willard et al, 1994; Zentek et al, 2002; Guilford & Matz,
2003).
> Adverse reactions to food

Adverse food reactions are an extremely common cause of chronic
gastrointestinal disease and can be divided into non-immunologically mediated 'food intolerance' and immunologically mediated 'food
allergy' (or hypersensitivity) (Table 24). Clinical signs may effect
more than one body system, but most common are dermatological
signs (e.g. pruritus) (See chapter 2), and gastrointestinal signs (e.g.
vomiting and diarrhea ). The gold standard of diagnosis involves response to exclusion diet and subsequent challenge (See Chapter 2).
The gut mucosa is exposed to numerous exogenous factors and has differentiated regulatory mechanisms which enable selective permeability for nutrients and certain macromolecules but also exclusion of
potentially harmful dietary, environmental or bacterial antigens. Discrimination of absorption and exclusion, tolerance and reactivity
results from complex regulatory processes that depend on the age of
the individual, the functional and regulatory mechanisms of the
immune system and the influence of exogenous factors. The interaction between luminal factors of dietary or bacterial origin and the gut
wall is of particular importance. Exogenous food antigens, e.g. pep-

Therefore, the level of fat tolerated by dogs with SIBO/ARD needs to be evaluated according
to individual needs. In cases that have experienced severe weight loss, it is justified to test
increased intakes of dietary fat as long as the clinical condition is not negatively affected. In
many chronic intestinal diseases, a high level of fat (20% of crude fat in a dry diet, supplying
more than 40% of the calories) is very well tolerated by the dogs. This may be explained by
the presence or absence of bacteria that are able to metabolize fatty acids and bile acids.

6 - Chronic diseases of the intestinal tract causing diarrhea

Digestion

tides, glycoproteins and lectins, but also microorganisms have the ability of interacting with the
gut wall and to induce reactions and regulatory and counter regulatory processes. The interaction
of luminal factors with the gut wall influences digestion (secretion, absorption, motility), immunological mechanisms (exclusion of antigens, regulation of the GI immune system, antigen processing, sensitivity, allergy), and neuro-endocrine processes.
Nutrition has a significant impact on the gastrointestinal tract of puppies and is of special importance for the function of the gut and the associated immune system during the early growth phase
and later in adulthood. If animals are sensitized, reducing the exposure to potential allergens seems
to be an important prerequisite for clinical improvement.

• Dietary management of adverse reactions to food
Dietary management of adverse reactions to food can be difficult in practice because clinical signs
can be slow to respond, and the animal will remain at risk of recurrence if dietary indiscretion
occurs. Therefore, good owner compliance is essential if long-term success is to be ensured. Because of the difficulties in deciding whether the underlying reason is a dietary allergy or unspecified
dietary intolerance without allergic etiology, dietary protocols should follow a standard model. In
this regard, the diet should have a balanced nutrient composition, high digestibility in the small
intestine and a restricted number of ingredients. Such a diet will support the patient because it
facilitates the digestion and absorption of essential nutrients and helps to reduce the amount of
potential antigens in the GIT. These goals can be achieved by using:
- home prepared diets;
- commercial diets with single or a limited number of protein sources; or
- hydrolyzed protein diets.
Even in those cases where the dietary intolerance is not linked to a specific protein or ingredient,
a dietary change can be helpful because the new diet may have a beneficial impact on the intestinal digestive processes and it may also influence the intestinal microflora. Such a change may
limit growth of potentially harmful microorganisms, and reduce the concentration of microbial
metabolites in the gut. Although it has not yet been proven that microbial metabolites can have
negative impact on the health of dogs with dietary intolerance, this concept seems to work in
practice.
In all cases of dietary intolerance, veterinarians should obtain a complete overview of the dietary history of the patient. In this regard, the clinician should ask detailed questions on the dietary
history, including information on the usual diet(s) fed and on all treats or table scraps that are fed.
In some cases it is possible to identify problematic food components which can then help when
formulating an elimination diet or selecting adequate diets from a commercial source. When it is
not possible to identify the offending compound, the choice of initial elimination diet will depend
upon the history of ingredients fed to that individual.
When a diet has been selected, it should be fed as the sole source of nutrition for sufficient time
to determine whether a positive response will occur. The ideal duration of such a diet trial has not
been determined. Some recommend up to 3 months, especially for dermatological cases. However, GI signs will often resolve more quickly, and owners of patients with diarrhea rarely have that
degree of patience. Therefore a trial length of ~3-4 weeks seems appropriate for most GI cases.
If a positive response is documented, food provocation trials can be performed to identify the exact
causal protein(s) i.e. single proteins are added sequentially to the diet for 7 days at a time. If no
response occurs the ingredient can be deemed safe; however, if signs recur the ingredient should
be avoided in the future. However, this is laborious and many owners elect not to pursue provocation if the elimination diet works (Willard et al, 1994; Zentek et al, 2002; Guilford & Matz, 2003).

116

Choice of protein
Meat, poultry and fish are usually used as a source of protein in exclusion diets. Suitable foods
include chicken, turkey, venison, rabbit, duck or lamb. Although lamb has commonly been used,
the widespread use of lamb protein in commercial diets would make this choice less suitable. Fish
is an excellent choice because it is an uncommon ingredient in commercial diets. Vegetable protein sources may be used in as long as they are properly processed (e.g. isolated soy protein).
Many foodstuffs that are used as a source of carbohydrates also include significant amounts of protein, and this could complicate the elimination test.
Gluten proteins from cereals (e.g. wheat – Figure
10 – and barley) have been investigated extensively because they can cause dietary allergy
(including celiac disease) in humans, and have
the potential to cause similar problems in companion animals. Therefore, this carbohydrate
source may be unsuitable for some patients with
dietary intolerance. However, given their high
digestibility, it may be worth considering their
use in patients that are not specifically sensitive
to them.
Another problem may result from other ingredients that are commonly used in a complete
balanced diet. For instance, fat sources may
contain small amounts of proteins, either animal
or plant derived. Although oils or fats may
contain only traces of proteins, it cannot be
excluded that this may affect the result of the
feeding trial.

Wheat gluten is a highly concentrated protein source (80-82% protein) with
exceptional digestibility. It is used in hydrolyzed form as a milk protein substitute
in neonatal food.

Wheat gluten is a complex mix of proteins from two
different families: the prolamines and glutenins.
It is obtained through traditional milling methods:
cleaning to eliminate wheat flour and bran,
steeping to eliminate the germ, grinding and
centrifugation to separate the solid non-soluble
part (the gluten) from the starch and other soluble
substances. The remaining solid part, without
the fiber and starch, is dried to obtain a powder:
gluten.
Wheat gluten has many nutritional qualities that
make it an exceptional source of protein. It is a
highly concentrated source of protein (80%-82%),
it is free of biogenic amines, has a very low dietary
fiber level and excellent ileal digestibility (99%).

Accordingly, using significant quantities of wheat
gluten helps reduce the flow of indigestible proteins
into the colon by 20% to 40%.
Wheat gluten is also a rich source of glutamine
(almost 40%). This amino acid has an important
role in maintaining digestive integrity, in conserving
muscle mass during intensive activity and in taurine
homeostasis in the event of illness or stress.
Glutamine is involved in protein synthesis and
constitutes a precursor of nucleic acids.
These different qualities rationalize the use
of wheat gluten as a dairy protein substitute
(over 99% digestible) in neonatal food.

Carbohydrate source
A single source of carbohydrate is also recommended for the elimination diet. Suitable ingredients
include corn, potato, rice and tapioca. Cereals are often avoided given the concerns over gluten
proteins. However, given that such sources are often highly digestible, such a carbohydrate source
may still be suitable for many cases.
Minerals and Trace elements
Minerals and trace elements have to be added to the main ingredients to make it complete and
balanced. However, some sources of mineral salts could contain small amounts of protein, which
might itself provoke an adverse reaction. Supplementation of a diet with vitamins can also be problematic, since some of the commonly used vitamins are protected by encapsulation with gelatin
(usually derived from beef or pork). Although the production process is rigid and most of the
potentially antigenic epitopes are destroyed, traces of proteins or peptides could still be introduced into a diet. These problems are of relevance for home-prepared diets as well as for commercial prescription diets. If this is a significant concern, one option is to use a home-prepared diet
that is based on a minimum of dietary ingredients. Adult dogs will tolerate this for a few weeks
without developing severe nutrient deficiencies. However, diets need to be balanced and complete if they are fed for longer than a few weeks. Commercially prepared pet foods offer the advantage of being nutritionally balanced from the beginning.
Diets containing single hydrolyzed proteins
In the last few years diets with hydrolyzed protein sources have became available. In these diets
the protein is treated enzymatically to alter its structure (Figure 11).

FIGURE 11 - ACQUISITION OF PROTEIN HYDROLYSATE

Protein

Given their small size, these peptides are in theory less
likely to interact with the immune system, and recent
work has demonstrated reduced in vitro antigenicity
compared with the native molecule (Cave & Guilford,
2004). Nevertheless, more work is required to confirm
that these diets are truly ‘hypoallergenic’. Hydrolyzed
protein diets have already been used successfully in the
production of diets for babies with milk allergy. A
hydrolyzed diet is likely to be beneficial in patients
with true food allergy (especially type 1), but whether
there is any benefit in non-immunological food intolerance, is less clear. Given their high digestibility,
these diets are likely to benefit patients with a variety
of different gastrointestinal disorders, and recent clinical trials have been encouraging (Dossin et al, 2002;
Mandigers & Biourge, 2004). Therefore, hydrolyzed
diets offer an alternative for patients when single protein source or restricted antigen diets do not work.

> Gluten-sensitive Enteropathy (GSE)

GSE is a specialized type of food sensitivity caused by an adverse reaction to gluten (wheat protein). It has been described in certain lines of Irish setters, although it is an extremely uncommon
diagnosis in clinical practice. The pathogenesis has been better defined in recent years (Garden et
al, 2000), although it is unclear whether an aberrant immune response to gluten, a direct toxic
effect of the gluten, or both is involved. The clinical condition has similarities with human celiac
disease, but the pathogenesis is different. Diagnosis can be made in a similar manner to other dietary sensitivities, and treatment involves feeding a gluten-free diet (i.e. avoid wheat, rye, barley,
oats and tritical which is a wheat-rye hybrid). Rice and corn do not contain gluten. Interestingly,

IBD defines a diverse group of intestinal disorders, which are characterized by inflammatory mucosal changes (both architectural abnormalities and cellular infiltrates) without a known inciting

GLUTEN ENTEROPATHY IN THE IRISH SETTER
This is not a gluten ‘allergy’. Although often used
by owners this term is inaccurate.
The disease manifests itself in clinical signs
generally associated with chronic small intestinal
pathology including diarrhea, wasting and delayed
growth. It is a rare hereditary disease that
primarily affects certain lines of Irish Setters.
Humans suffering from celiac disease are said
to be gluten-intolerant, but in reality they are
gliadin-intolerant. This is a chronic disease whose
symptoms vary from light, non-specific digestive
complaints to severe malabsorption (severe
diarrhea).

Celiac disease depends on the exposure of
genetically sensitive individuals to one specific
gluten protein, gliadin. The cause is a defect in
intestinal permeability that allows antigens in
the intestinal lumen to traverse the mucosa.
Clinical symptoms:
- Intermittent or chronic diarrhea at an early age,
between 4 and 7 months
- Weight loss
- Malabsorption
Treatment: a gliadin-free diet (wheat, barley,
oats, rye, triticale, which is a wheat-rye hybrid).

cells are most commonly seen (lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis; LPE), whilst eosinophilic predominance (eosinophilic enteritis; EE) is noted in a few cases. Many cases have a generalized
increase in many immune cell subsets and cannot easily be classified into one histological group.
Such classification is often arbitrary, and depends upon the opinion of the pathologist concerned.
Other types of IBD (e.g. granulomatous enteritis) are rare in dogs. Moderate to severe changes are
often associated with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) (see below).
The underlying etiology of canine IBD is unknown, and comparisons have been made with the
human counterparts where a breakdown of immunological tolerance to luminal antigens (bacteria and dietary components) is thought to be critical. Antigens derived from the endogenous
microflora and (possibly) dietary antigens are likely to be important in disease pathogenesis, whilst a potential role for diet-related factors is suggested by the clinical benefit of dietary therapy in
some cases of canine IBD.
Alterations in immune cell populations in canine LPE have been documented, including increases
in lamina propria T cells (especially CD4+ cells), IgG+ plasma cells, macrophages and granulocytes (German et al, 2001). Marked increases in mucosal cytokines have also been documented in
canine LPE, with increased expression of Th1 (IL-2, IL-12 and IFNγ), Th2 (IL-5), proinflammatory (TNF-α) and immunoregulatory (TGF-β) cytokines (German et al, 2000). This suggests
immune system dysregulation in dogs with IBD, but does not confirm how this has arisen. The
pathogenesis of eosinophilic enteritis (EE) has not been studied in detail, but similar mechanisms
may exist to those suggested for LPE. EE must be differentiated from other diseases that can cause
increases in eosinophil number such as endoparasitism and dietary hypersensitivity.

many Irish setters that are affected when young grow out of the condition in adulthood. The extent
to which gluten is a potential allergen in other breeds is not known. Given that the frequency of
adverse reactions to food are usually related to the frequency with which the protein is fed in commercial diets, there is no reason to suspect that dogs are especially sensitive to wheat proteins.
Therefore, the need to avoid gluten in every case with an adverse food reaction is questionable.

CLASSICALLY ENCOUNTERED
IN CHRONIC INTESTINAL
INFLAMMATORY DISEASE

In dogs, the most common clinical sign is chronic small bowel diarrhea, which can be accompanied by weight loss and vomiting. Owners often mention that the gastroenteritis symptomatic periods become more and more frequent, month after month. If PLE is severe, there may be signs of
ascites and/or subcutaneous edema (especially if total serum/plasma protein and albumin concentrations are low), whilst other clinical sequelae can occur including systemic immune-mediated
disorders and, exceptionally, thromboembolism. Diagnosis is usually made by histopathological
assessment of intestinal tissue by endoscopic or exploratory laparotomy, after having eliminated
other potential causes with a thorough diagnostic work up (Table 22) (Figures 12A-B).

Given the variability in interpretation of pathological changes in intestinal biopsies between
pathologists, a world small animal veterinary association (WSAVA) working party is currently in
the process of defining standardized criteria.

12A - Duodenitis

duodenum. Note the erythematous
coloration and increased granularity.

Treatment often involves a combination of therapies including dietary modification, antibacterials and immunosuppressive medication. If clinical signs are stable and sequelae not too severe
(e.g. PLE), treatment trials should first be instigated with dietary modification and with antibacterials (See above). Immunosuppressive medication should only be used when other treatments
fail. In this way cases that are truly idiopathic in nature can be discerned from food-responsive
and antibiotic-responsive conditions.
> Alimentary lymphoma

The most common malignancies in dogs are lymphoma, epithelial tumors and smooth muscle
tumors. However, other types of neoplasia can occur including fibrosarcoma, haemangiosarcoma
and plasma cell tumors.

of an inflammatory nature.

Lymphoma is characterized by mucosal and submucosal infiltration with neoplastic lymphocytes,
which can then lead to clinical sequel. Lymphoma can either present in a diffuse manner, infiltrating large areas of intestinal wall, or can present as a focal mass lesion. Diffuse forms affect digestive and absorptive processes and lead to malabsorption and protein losing enteropathy (PLE). In
contrast, focal forms can cause complete or partial obstruction of the intestine. The etiology in
dogs is not known. LPE is reported to progress to lymphoma, and lymphoma can also co-exist with
LPE within adjacent regions of small intestine. However, given discrepancies in histopathological interpretation, it is not clear whether these theories are genuine or are the result of initial misdiagnosis of lymphoma.
Treatment of lymphoma involves standard combination chemotherapy protocols, based on prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and vincristine. However, the disease is usually rapidly progressive,
and the majority of patients respond poorly to therapy. In the minority of cases that do respond
dietary management may form a useful adjunct (See Oncology Chapter 13). If gastrointestinal
signs are severe, changing to a highly digestible diet may be of benefit. The concurrence of cancer cachexia may require a diet with increased energy density.
> Protein-losing enteropathy and lymphangiectasia

Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is the term used to describe an intestinal disease that is accompanied by marked loss of plasma proteins through the gastrointestinal tract. When the hepatic
capacity for protein synthesis is exceeded serum protein concentrations (both albumin and globulin) fall. The situation can be confounded by the concurrence of protein malabsorption with
many of these conditions. Reductions in circulating protein concentrations (especially albumin)
lead to reduced plasma oncotic pressure, and severe reductions (e.g. albumin <1.5 g/dL) lead to
clinical consequences (e.g. ascites, subcutaneous edema, intestinal wall edema etc).

120

An elimination diet may discriminate
adverse food reactions, and benefit IBD
cases because these diseases can occasionally
be secondary to mucosal inflammation. Thus a
dietary change might be beneficial even if there
is no proven sensitivity against the current
protein ingredients. Changing to a diet that is
highly digestible is also beneficial.
Another relevant factor is fat restriction or
modification of the fat source. The response
of dogs to dietary fat cannot be predicted. Some
patients may benefit from a low-fat diet because
fatty acids can be hydroxylated in the GIT by
certain bacteria. Hydroxylated fatty acids can
induce secretory diarrhea. Conversely, fat
restriction means that the diet contains higher
amounts of either proteins or carbohydrates.

When the digestive processes are impaired due
to the inflammation of the gut wall, the absorption of amino acids, peptides and carbohydrates
can be reduced. Low-fat diets will have reduced
energy densities compared to standard products.
A study on ten IBD patients demonstrated that
a high-fat dry food (20% fat) can help improve
fecal consistency, resolve vomiting and improve
body condition (Lecoindre & Biourge, 2005).
The effectiveness of the nutritional treatment
is also explained by the choice of high-quality
highly-digestible proteins to minimize protein indigestion and consequently reduce the
production of toxins by putrefying bacterial flora.

Probiotics and prebiotics may be used as
ingredients or additives in these patients. Many
practitioners prescribe live yoghurt and other
probiotic supplements, although these have not
been fully evaluated in dogs and the clinical
benefits in cases with IBD need to be identified.
There is some evidence that probiotics and
prebiotics can be helpful in managing chronic
IBD in humans (Willard et al, 1994; Zentek et al,
2002; Guilford & Matz, 2003).

Suitable fat sources include vegetable oils,
poultry fat and fish oil. Fish oil offers the
advantage of a high percentage of long chain
omega-3 fatty acids (EPA-DHA). These fatty acids
may have some beneficial effects due to their
anti-inflammatory activities.

The causes of PLE are listed in Table 25; the three most important conditions are IBD, lymphoma and lymphangiectasia. However, there has also been a recent report of PLE associated with
intestinal crypt lesions, without evidence of lymphangiectasia or inflammation in most cases
(Willard et al, 2000). The underlying etiology of such lesions is not known. Response to therapy,
with antibacterials and immunosuppressive medication is variable. Some dogs deteriorate suddenly and can die from thromboembolic disease. However, malnutrition is the most significant
problem.

A very high quality protein source is vital for patients with protein-losing enteropathy (cottage
cheese, cooked chicken or turkey meat, boiled eggs). The protein intake should be adjusted to

DIETARY MANAGEMENT FOR LYMPHANGIECTASIA
The nutritional treatment of patients with lymphangiectasia is based
on the application of foods with a low-fat concentration. Low-fat
diets seem to be helpful in counteracting the pathophysiology in
lymphangiectasia. However, patients with this type of intestinal
disease need to be supplied with adequate amounts of essential
fatty acids, e.g. linoleic acid.
Previously, medium-chain triglycerides were recommended since they
were though to be absorbed directly into the portal blood circulation,
therefore bypassing the lymphatic system. However, recent studies
have contradicted this mechanism, and suggested that this lipid
group is absorbed via lymphatics. Furthermore, high doses of
medium-chain fatty acids can have negative effects in dogs and may
induce vomiting and diarrhea. Therefore the use of these nutrients
cannot be recommended.

Intestinal lymphangiectasia is characterized by the abnormal dilatation and dysfunction of lymphatic vessels within the mucosa and submucosa. It may be primary (localized or generalized lymphatic abnormality) or secondary (e.g. to lymphatic obstruction). Such an obstruction can be within the intestine (i.e. neoplastic infiltration,
inflammation or fibrosis) or systemic (e.g. right-sided cardiac failure,
caval obstruction or hepatic disease). The lacteal dilatation is associated with exudation of protein-rich lymph into the intestine, and
severe lipid malabsorption. As a result, severe hypoproteinemia or
lymphatic flow disturbances result in ascites, subcutaneous edema and
chylothorax.

Treatment for secondary lymphangiectasia involves rectifying (if possible) the underlying cause e.g. right-sided cardiac failure. For primary
lymphangiectasia, treatment is usually supportive and symptomatic.
This involves decreasing enteric protein loss (see below), resolving
Supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins is advised, and there are

corticoid therapy may benefit some cases especially if the disease is
secondary to an inflammatory cause e.g. IBD. Adjunctive therapy
with metronidazole or tylosin may also be of benefit. Finally, diuretics
are indicated in the management of effusions and combinations of diuretics are preferred (e.g. furosemide and spironolactone). Intravenous administration of plasma or colloid may also help if
hypoproteinemia is marked. The prognosis is most cases is guarded, and response to therapy is
usually poor in most cases.

7 - Specific large intestinal
conditions causing
diarrhea
Specific diseases of the large intestine are presented in Table 26. Adverse reactions to food and
IBD can affect the large intestine, resulting in large intestinal signs i.e. hematochezia, tenesmus,
fecal mucus. The pathogenesis and treatment of the condition is similar to that discussed above.
However, some clinicians favor the use of the anti-inflammatory medication sulphasalazine, and
there is some evidence that modification of dietary fiber content may be of benefit (see below).
Other common chronic large intestinal conditions include idiopathic colitis, stress-associated colitis (‘irritable colon syndrome’), fiber-responsive colitis and Clostridium perfringens associated colitis.

Stress-associated colitis
(irritable colon syndrome,
irritable syndrome)
Stress-associated colitis is a condition with similarities to irritable bowel syndrome and presents
with signs of intermittent, often mucoid, diarrhea, with urgency, occasional vomiting, tenesmus
and hematochezia. In some cases borborygmi, flatulence, ‘bloating’, and abdominal pain are described. This often occurs in nervous/highly strung dogs e.g. toy breeds and competition dogs. The
etiopathogenesis is poorly understood, but a number of hypotheses have been suggested:
- Primary intestinal motility defect
- Heightened sensation of intestinal distension/motility
- Psychological factors
- Undiagnosed organic disease

Clostridium perfringens associated colitis
The existence of this condition is controversial, and many gastroenterologists do not agree as to
causes and pathogenesis. C. perfringens can be a normal inhabitant of the canine large intestine,
and its identification at fecal culture is not abnormal. However, sporulation is associated with
liberation of endotoxin, which is not necessarily associated with clinical signs. It was previously
suggested that the presence of spore-forming organisms on a fecal smear / rectal cytology was
diagnostic. However, recent studies have demonstrated spores and detectable endotoxin in both
healthy dogs and those with clinical signs (Marks et al, 1999). Whilst small numbers of endospores
does not confirm the condition (e.g. up to 8-10 per high power microscope field), the presence of
large numbers may be suggestive. Nevertheless, tests for C. perfringens enterotoxin A or B (CPA,
CPB) are commercially available and are the preferred method of diagnosis.
The condition is more likely to arise as an acute intestinal disorder, especially in dogs housed in
a colony environment. Some individuals may be susceptible to the organism and, given its ubiquitous nature, may suffer repeated bouts or persistent clinical signs. Treatment usually involves
prescribing antibacterials to which the organism is sensitive e.g. ampicillin, metronidazole, and
multiple or long courses may be required. Increasing the fiber content of the diet is also reported
to be beneficial. It is possible, that there may be overlap between this condition and the syndrome
of fiber-responsive colitis (see above).

DIETARY MANAGEMENT FOR LARGE INTESTINAL DISEASES CAUSING DIARRHEA
Dietary management of large intestinal diarrhea
depends on the underlying disease. Initially, a
bland diet fed in multiple small feedings can be
used for 2-6 weeks. The diet may either be a
commercial diet or a home prepared diet based
on low-fat types of meat (chicken or lamb) or
fish, low lactose dairy products (low-fat cottage
cheese) and carbohydrate sources that are easily
digestible and that have low allergenicity
(rice, potatoes, tapioca, starch).
Long-term treatment of colonic diseases is based
on three principles of dietary treatment, which
may be used in different combinations.
The goals are:
- regulating the disturbed motility
- influencing the composition and metabolic
activity of the gastrointestinal microflora
- excluding dietary antigens if allergy or
sensitivity is involved

Adding dietary fiber, either quantitatively or
qualitatively by using soluble and insoluble fiber
sources, can modify motility. Fiber sources
that may be used include insoluble fibers such
as wheat bran, oat bran or cellulose. When
tolerated, these fibers may have a regulatory
effect on peristalsis and transit time. Soluble
fibers may have positive effects on stool quality
by their water binding effects. Good sources
for soluble fiber include carrots (cooked, ground)
or the bulk forming seeds of psyllium (Plantago
psyllium), or ispaghula (Plantago ovata).

The acid production influences intestinal
acidity and impacts the metabolic
activity of the microflora. Butyric acid is
directly utilized by colonocytes and has
anti-inflammatory properties. Many commercial
high-fiber diets already contain fermentable
dietary fiber, such as the moderately fermentable
fiber, beet pulp.

Soluble fiber sources can be used to modify the
composition and the metabolic activity of the
intestinal bacteria. Soluble fibers are fermented
by a variety of bacteria in the large intestine and
increase the production of short chain organic
acids, including lactic, acetic, propionic
and butyric acid.

1994; Zentek et al, 2002; Guilford & Matz 2003).

Many patients with chronic colitis respond
to hypoallergenic diets, and the underlying
mechanisms are similar to those described
for dietary allergy (see above) (Willard et al,

123

Digestion

The syndrome of fiber-responsive colitis has recently been reported (Leib et al, 2000). The etiopathogenesis is poorly understood but may well have similarities to stress-associated colitis (see
above). As the name implies, therapy involves dietary management with a high-fiber diet (>8%
crude fiber or 15% total dietary fiber DMB). It may be interesting to test various sources of soluble
and insoluble fiber.

For legal reasons, the fiber content
stated on packaging relates to the
crude fiber content, which
significantly underestimates the
actual fiber content of the food,
especially if it has not been lignified
to any great degree. The total
dietary fiber stated in technical
documentation or available on
request from the manufacturer
is a more reliable estimation.

7 - Specific large intestinal conditions causing diarrhea

There are no specific diagnostic tests for stress-associated colitis, and diagnosis is made by consideration of the signalment together with exclusion of all other organic diseases. Treatment
involves eliminating stressful events if possible, behavioral modification and (in some cases) drug
therapy (anticholinergics, sedatives, and antispasmodics, e.g. hyoscine, diazepam or peppermint
oil).

8 - Chronic diseases of the intestinal tract causing constipation

Digestion

8 - Chronic diseases of the intestinal
tract causing constipation
Constipation is defined as infrequent defecation, of excessively dry or hard feces. It is commonly
accompanied by increased straining to defecate. Causes of constipation are listed in Table 27.

TABLE 27 - CONDITIONS OF THE LARGE INTESTINE
CAUSING CHRONIC CONSTIPATION

• Dietary and environmental
- Diet e.g. low residue diet, bones, foreign material
- Lack of exercise
- Change of environment
- Hospitalization
• Painful defecation
- Ano-rectal disease e.g. anal sacculitis and abscess, perianal
fistula, rectal foreign body
- Trauma e.g. fractured pelvis or limb, dislocated hip
(unable to squat)
• Mechanical obstruction
- Extraluminal e.g. healed pelvic fracture, prostatic
enlargement, pelvic tumor
- Intraluminal e.g. rectal tumor, perineal hernia
• Neuromuscular disease
- CNS e.g. paraplegia, cauda equina syndrome
- Intrinsic dysfunction e.g. idiopathic megacolon,
dysautonomia
• Metabolic and endocrine disease These diseases can
interfer with colonic muscle function. Examples include:
- Hypothyroidism
- Diabetes mellitus
- Hypokalemia
• Debility resulting in general muscle weakness
and dehydration

Obstipation is defined as an inability to pass feces, and arises when constipation is prolonged resulting in formation of progressively harder and drier
feces. Defecation becomes increasingly more difficult, until it is virtually
impossible because of secondary degenerative changes in colonic muscle.
Megacolon is a descriptive term for a persistent, generalized enlargement of
the diameter of the colon. It may be congenital or acquired, with the acquired cases arising secondary to numerous disorders including fluid/electrolyte
imbalances (especially hypokalemia), dietary problems (low residue diet,
ingestion of foreign material), painful defecation, neuromuscular disorders
and colonic obstruction.
Colonic impaction usually occurs with a mixture of feces and ingested hair,
bones etc. Recurrent bouts may lead to secondary megacolon / obstipation.
The main clinical sign of constipation is tenesmus, with multiple unsuccessful attempts to defecate. Occasionally animals may pass scanty liquid
feces around the impaction and the owner thinks animal has 'diarrhea '.
Other signs include vomiting and dyschezia (painful or difficult defecation).

Diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis of constipation involves first confirming that the large intestine is
the organ involved e.g. by ruling out other possible causes of tenesmus (urogenital tract diseases). The presence of fecal matter within the large intestine can be confirmed on physical examination by abdominal and rectal palpation. This enables the differentiation of constipation from colitis as a cause
of tenesmus. Radiography will confirm the diagnosis and enable predisposing factors to be identified e.g. pelvic canal narrowing from previous pelvic
fracture. Other diagnostic measures (e.g. laboratory analyses) are required to
assess for metabolic diseases as an underlying cause.

Treatment involves first rectifying the underlying cause if possible e.g. perineal hernia repair.
Options for medical management are listed in Table 28. If megacolon has developed surgical
management may be necessary e.g. subtotal colectomy.

Some cases of constipation will respond to an increased fiber content of the diet. Fiber sources
have to be selected according to their physiological properties.
• Dietary fiber with a low solubility e.g. cellulose, increase the bulk in the intestine and may help
to regulate intestinal motility. Besides their effects on motility, insoluble fiber has a certain capacity to bind non-absorbed fluid by physical forces. Therefore, fecal quality of patients with colonic disorders may improve by the addition of small amounts of insoluble fiber.

fruits, and gum-like fiber e.g. guar gum or
psyllium. These fiber sources have a different structure compared to cellulose,
and can, with the exception of psyllium, be fermented by intestinal bacteria. Negative effects of
higher amounts of soluble dietary fiber include increased moisture content of the feces which,
when in high amounts can negatively impact fecal quality.

• The fermentation processes induced by the ingestion of fermentable fibers have a strong impact
on the colonic milieu, because bacteria release organic acids as products of the metabolism that
tend to reduce the colonic pH. The short chain fatty acids that are released by bacteria can be
partly utilized by the colonic mucosa. Improved supply with butyric acid has beneficial effects in
humans suffering from colitis. The organic acids can also have some regulatory effects on motility. Furthermore, the addition of fermentable dietary fiber reduces the concentration of some bacteria that can be considered potentially harmful and increase the concentrations of some bacteria that are regarded as being beneficial.
Although these ideas need further investigation, the addition of moderate amounts of insoluble/non fermentable and soluble/fermentable dietary fiber is common in practice and seems to
work in many patients with chronic colonic disorders. It may be necessary to investigate the effects
individually and to adjust the amount of fiber according to the tolerance and the clinical effects
in the patient. In cases with severe problems due to constipation or fecal impaction the laxative
effects of soluble fiber sources are used specifically for treatment. In those patients the application
of fermentable carbohydrates, e.g. lactulose or lactose is possible. Again, the dosage needs to be
adjusted individually. As a general rule, the dosage should be altered to produce a slight increase
in fecal moisture. The fecal pH normally drops from values above 7 to 6.5. In those cases where
owners prefer to use common feedstuffs, wheat bran is a good additive that increases the fiber
content of a diet and has regulatory effects on the gut motility. Ingredients with laxative properties are liver, milk and milk products (Willard et al, 1994; Zentek et al, 2002; Guilford &Matz 2003).
125

Digestion

Dysfunction of the colon can be related to different etiologies. Nutritional treatment includes restriction of dietary antigens, as already described for patients with allergy, and the addition of ingredients that help to modify intestinal motility. Further, diet composition is an important determinant for the water holding capacity of the undigested material reaching the colon.

Frequently asked questions

Digestion

Frequently asked questions:
diet in case of digestive complaints

Q

A

I want to perform an elimination
diet trial, should I use a
home-prepared diet or a
commercially-formulated diet?

Some investigators recommend using a home-prepared diet for such a purpose, because it is
easier to keep track of the ingredients and there are no hidden additives. However, such diets
are unbalanced and inappropriate for long-term use. They are laborious for the client and the
exact composition of the diet may vary from batch to batch. Home-prepared diets are often
more expensive than feeding a ‘prescription diet’. The advantage of a commercial diet is that
the same diet can be used both for diagnosis and treatment.

I want to perform an elimination
diet trial, what is the best diet to
use, and for how long should
I feed it?

No single diet necessarily suits every patient, and the exact choice should be tailored to the individual. The previous diet of the individual should be used to decide upon the most appropriate ingredients. A traditional elimination diet is composed of single protein and carbohydrate source; available choices for protein include chicken, soy, fish, venison, rabbit, and duck; available choices for
carbohydrate include rice, corn [maize], tapioca and potato. Foodstuffs based upon fish protein often
make suitable choices for dogs because, unlike cats, this protein is uncommonly used in standard
canine diets. Hydrolyzed protein diets are also available, and these are based either on chicken or
soy protein. The major advantage of using a hydrolyzed protein diet is that such diets are highly
digestible, and it is unlikely for a patient to have previously been exposed to hydrolyzed proteins.
The optimum duration for an elimination diet trial is unknown, and many cases require 12 weeks
to respond. For dogs with gastrointestinal signs, many investigators recommend an elimination diet
trial of 3-4 weeks, partly because clinical experience suggests most cases respond rapidly (1-2 weeks),
and partly because most owners will not tolerate their pet having continued signs of vomiting and
diarrhea.

I want to provide fiber-supplementation for a dog with large intestinal diarrhea, how should I go
about this?

There are two possible approaches; first, to feed a commercial ‘high-fiber’ diet and second, to add a
fiber supplement to the existing diet. Both approaches have their merit, but the latter approach can
be tried in clinical cases. In this regard, an elimination diet is tried first, since many cases with large
intestinal signs have adverse reactions to food. If response is suboptimal a fiber supplement (e.g.
psyllium or Metamucil®), can then be added to gage the effect of additional fiber supplementation.

What is a sacrificial protein, and
should I contemplate using this
approach?

A sacrificial protein is a novel protein incorporated into a diet fed during the initial treatment phase
of a dog with inflammatory bowel disease. A second novel protein is then fed once the inflammation has subsided and used for long-term management. The basis of such an approach is that such
patients have ongoing mucosal inflammation, and increased permeability. By feeding a novel protein in the face of such inflammation, there is a theoretical concern that normal mucosal tolerance will be abrogated allowing hypersensitivity to the novel protein. If a single novel protein is used,
the potential benefit of using a novel protein diet may be lost; using two diets in series means that
a novel hypersensitivity does not develop against the diet intended for long-term control. Whilst
there may be theoretical merit, there is no real scientific or clinical basis on which to base this
approach, and it is seldom if ever necessary to undertake it. Hypoallergenic diets based on protein
hydrolysates may make this practice even less useful (Mandigers & Biourge, 2004).

How much should I feed a dog
with severe IBD that has lost 30%
of its body weight?

It is important to remember to feed the patient according to its current body weight. The amount
fed can then be gradually increased to take account of the individual status of the patient (e.g. activity level, working dog etc), the effects of malabsorption and to achieve adequate body weight gain.
The patient should be weighed regularly and the exact caloric intake tailored to response. If the
patient tolerates a moderate fat diet, this may be preferable to a traditional low-fat diet, because the
overall volume of diet fed can be reduced.

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

Brachycephalic dog breeds (e.g. Bulldogs) have
a higher risk of frequent regurgitation. This problem
is facilitated by two anatomical characteristics:
the esophagus is slightly convoluted rather than
straight, and the cardia is often atonic. Abdominal
compressions due to inspiration also facilitate
gastro-esophageal reflux.

Key Points
to remember:

Dysphagia
Dysphagia refers to disorders of
deglutition. Oral dysphagia is characterized by the inability to take food,
to lap liquids or to propel the food
bolus to the pharynx. Pharyngeal
and esophageal dysphagia are typically characterized by the occurrence
of regurgitation and ptyalism.
Regurgitation refers to spontaneous
or induced expulsion, without any
effort of abdominal contraction, of
masticated food coated with saliva.
Regurgitation
contents
rarely
contain blood and never contain
bile.

Regurgitation commonly occurs
shortly after eating, however, it may
be delayed in certain esophageal
diseases.
In all cases, etiological diagnosis
should be established because esophageal disorders can be a manifestation of systemic disease. However,
the treatment of these disorders
often remains symptomatic, combining specific nutritional and medical
approaches.

Nutritional therapy is essential.
Sometimes advanced malnutrition
will have to be treated. In these
cases enteral or parenteral feeding may be necessary.

When oral feeding is possible, it is
necessary to use highly digestible
foods with a fairly liquid consistency. These diets should be fed
from a height to capitalize on gravity to facilitate the transit of food
to the stomach.

Key Points
to remember:

Chronic Diarrhea
The scientific definition of diarrhea is
based on an increase in the liquidity
and the volume of fecal matter as
well as the frequency of evacuation.
This is the most common clinical sign
of an intestinal complaint in dogs,
although many extra-digestive complaints may accompany diarrhea.

128

Chronic diarrhea is described somewhat arbitrarily if it does not resolve
spontaneously or if it does not
respond to symptomatic treatment
within 3-4 weeks.

A logical and well reasoned diagnostic procedure will establish a rational
foundation for an appropriate therapeutic plan in which nutrition is
essential.

Efficacy of a soy hydrolysate-based diet in the management
of chronic canine gastroenteritis: a controlled study
The purpose of this study was to
compare the response of dogs with
chronic gastrointestinal signs suggestive of adverse reaction to food to
high digestible diets. One of the test
diets was a soy protein isolate hydrolysate based diet.

and to obtain biopsies for histopathology. The mean age at presentation was 4.3 ± 3.3 years (range 0.6-11
yrs) and mean body weight was 23 ±
12 kg (4.7-40 kg). The sex ratio, age
and body weight were similar between both groups of dogs.

Materials and methods

- Eighteen dogs received a soy protein isolate hydrolysate-based diet
(Veterinary Diet Hypoallergenic DR21,
Royal Canin)

Twenty-six dogs with a history of
chronic vomiting, diarrhea, and/or
weight loss were included in the
study. On the basis of clinical signs, a
gastroduodenal or a colonic endoscopy was performed to rule out
foreign bodies, gastritis, ulcer, neoplasia, hyperacidity, pyloric stenosis,

The owners were instructed to exclusively feed the diet that they were
given for two months. No medications were allowed. If no or little
improvement was observed over the
2 months of dietary therapy, drug
therapy was initiated. If improvement was noted after 2 months
owners were requested to challenge
their dogs with their previous diet.

- Eight dogs received a highly digestible low residue diet (Veterinary Diet

resolved in 16 of 18 dogs on the soy
hydrolysate diet and 7 of 8 dogs on
the low residue diet after two
months of dietary therapy. The 3
remaining dogs improved but still
had occasional episodes of vomiting
or diarrhea. The dogs on the hydrolyzed protein diet gained significantly
more body weight compared to the
dogs on the low residue diet.

start of the clinical study.

Conclusion

- 13 of 15 dogs on the hydrolysate
diet remained free of clinical signs
and 2 of 15 showed minor signs.
- Only 2 of 6 dogs on the low residue
diet remained free of clinical signs.
The remaining four dogs needed
drug therapy to alleviate their clinical signs.

Although in the short term, soy
hydrolysate and low residue diets
appear satisfactory in the management of chronic diarrhea and vomiting associated with adverse reaction
to food, the soy hydrolysate based
diet induced better weight gain and
was better tolerated in the long
term.

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

Dietary hypersensitivity is proposed
as one possible cause of IBD. The purpose of this study was to assess, in
field conditions, the effect of a hypoallergenic diet formulated with soy
protein isolate hydrolysate (Royal
Canin, hypoallergenic DR 21) for the
treatment of IBD.

Materials and methods
Eight dogs were included in the
study, seven of which were in normal
body condition at the start of the
study. The inclusion criterion for the
study was IBD confirmed by histological evaluation of intestinal biopsies
associated with at least one clinical

sign (diarrhea, vomiting or weight
loss).
Initially the diet was given as the
only treatment. If the diet alone did
not improve the clinical signs after 4
weeks of therapy, metronidazole followed by prednisolone therapy was
used. Clinical and fecal assessments
were performed every 2 weeks.

Results
Mean fecal score dramatically improved with dietary therapy (1.5 ± 0.53
vs 3.62 ± 0.52, p< 0.01, Student’s ttest). In 6 of 8 dogs which initially
had abnormal bowel movements,
the mean number of bowel move-

ments improved from 4.12 ± 1.73
/day to 2.5 ± 0.53/day (p<0.05,
Student’s t-test). Recovery was observed in all dogs between 4 and 16
weeks following introduction of the
diet but 3 of 8 dogs required additional treatment.
During endoscopic examination, no
obvious improvement of the intestinal mucosa was noted except in the
colon of 1 dog. General histological
scores were not different before

in the intestinal mucosa was reduced.

Conclusion
These preliminary results suggest
that a soy isolate hydrolysate diet
could be useful in the clinical management of IBD, even in severe cases,
and might be a good alternative to
the use of corticosteroids.

Digestion

Key points
to remember:

Constipation
Constipation is characterized by
increased fecal transit time. Clinically,
this leads to less frequent, sometimes
painful defecation and the passing
of dehydrated, abnormally hard and
dry stools. This syndrome, quite frequent in veterinary medicine, is
often considered as a disorder of
intestinal transit. However the possible reasons for constipation are

numerous and some of these may
result in an occlusive syndrome and
irreversible lesions in the large intestine.
Diagnostic evaluations should be
chosen in a logical way and according to clinical observations.
Nutritional therapy is essential in
patients with recurrent constipation

Historical signs of constipation:
Dyschezia, infrequent, dehydrated stools,
passing mucus and blood,
abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting

and those with already severe lesions
in the large intestine (megacolon).
Finally the nutritional approach
should take into account the etiology of constipation.

* The proportion of dietary fiber in dry foods varies quite considerably. It appears that dietary fiber intake of approximately 5-7%
guarantees regular transit in most dogs. In animals with a tendency to constipation, this intake may be increased to 10-15%.
Diets containing more than 15% fiber may paradoxically induce constipation.

132

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

For legal reasons, the fiber content
stated on dog food packaging
relates to the crude fiber content,
which significantly underestimates
the actual fiber content of the food,

especially if it has not been lignified
to any great degree. The total dietary fiber stated in technical documentation or available on request from
the manufacturer is a more reliable
estimation.

Digestion

Important remark

Focus on:

Psyllium
The effect of psyllium is related to
the great capacity of the fiber, which
makes up the testa, to retain water.
Due to this fiber, which is 65% mucilage, the seeds are able to bind up to
ten times their own weight in water.
When only psyllium testae are used
the swelling index is between 70 and
85!

The various species of psyllium (Plantago
ovata, Plantago ispaghula) are plants that
originated in India.

Psyllium is a plant traditionally used
to treat digestive complaints in many
countries. It takes its name from the
Greek psyllia, which means flea. The
seeds, black or golden depending on
the species, resemble tiny aphids called psyllids or jumping plant lice.
Psyllium seeds are odorless and
almost flavorless.

Psyllium is well known for its laxative
properties. The psyllium fiber is only
partially fermented by the colonic
microflora. The mucilages work as a
sponge by swelling as they bind the
water to create a viscous gel. By this
mechanism, psyllium has an antidiarrheic effect by increasing the viscosity of the intestinal chyme.

- It combats diarrhea by regulating
the progression of chyme in the
small intestine and fecal matter in
the colon (Bliss et al, 2001). Psyllium is
widely used in food for sled dogs to
prevent stress diarrhea:
- It reduces constipation by facilitating the elimination of stools
(Voderholzer, 1998).
Compared with other sources of
fiber, the addition of psyllium produces
larger,
moister
stools.
However, being minimally fermentable, psyllium fiber does not alter
the digestive tolerance.

Lubrication induced by the psyllium
gel stimulates peristalsis (thus limiting the risks associated with the presence of any toxins), facilitating the
propulsion of the contents of the
colon and fecal elimination.
Psyllium acts at all levels:
- It slows down gastric emptying
(Xiahong et al, 2005), which assists the
proper digestion of proteins:

The thick, outer-coat of the psyllium seed
(testa) represents an interesting source of
mucilages, which is soluble fiber that is
able to bind up to ten times its weight in
water.

T

he liver has many complex functions which is reflected in
the multitude of pathophysiological derangements that can
occur in liver disease. The liver has however a huge reserve
capacity and great potential to regenerate, and clinical signs
occur only when this reserve is exhausted by progressive disease.

134

1 - Diagnosis of liver diseases

The liver is essential for the digestion, absorption, metabolism and storage of most nutrients (Table
1). Malnutrition is therefore common in liver disease, and the lack of nutrients can also aggravate
it (Center, 1999b; Laflamme, 1999). Nutritional support is the keystone in the management of
dogs with liver disease. It is therefore imperative to maintain nutrition status.
In acute liver disease, treatment is mainly aimed at supporting the patient during this process of
hepatic regeneration, and patients may fully recover provided there has only been a single sublethal insult to the liver.

Liver

In chronic liver disease, the emphasis is on supporting the limited remaining metabolic capabilities of the liver, to minimize complications and to prevent progression of liver disease, e.g. by curtailing oxidative reactions. Early nutritional intervention in the management of malnutrition,
ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is especially important and can reduce morbidity and
mortality.

History and clinical signs
Historical findings in dogs with liver disease are often vague and non-specific, and rarely evident
until liver disease is advanced. The onset of clinical signs may be acute, even though this may be
the end result of liver disease that has been progressing for many weeks or months.
Physical examination findings are often variable and non-specific. Jaundice, abnormal liver size
and ascites are the findings most suggestive of liver disease, but these may also be seen in other
diseases not related to the liver. The only sign specific for liver disease is acholic (grey) feces, which
may be found in complete extrahepatic bile duct obstruction (Table 2).

This is not a common sign of liver disease, and signifies severe disease. It may however also be due to
hemolysis or post-hepatic causes (such as compression of the common bile duct, commonly seen in
acute pancreatitis, or obstruction, due to neoplasia or cholelithiasis) (Leveille-Webster, 2000).

In dogs, most chronic liver diseases result in reduced liver size, and even acute diseases may cause
little change in size. Hepatomegaly is uncommon but may be seen in hepatic neoplasia and congestion, and with secondary involvement in metabolic disease (e.g. hyperadrenocorticism).
> Ascites

This is a common occurrence in dogs with severe chronic liver disease, and is mostly caused by
portal hypertension. It is a modified transudate, as also seen in congestive heart failure and neoplasia. It has to be distinguished from transudate, which may occur in protein-losing enteropathy
and nephropathy, and from exudates, as in peritonitis, hemorrhage, and ruptured biliary or urinary tract.

FIGURE

Laboratory assessment is essential to identify hepatic disease, assess severity and monitor progression;
however, laboratory tests will not identify specific diseases and may be influenced by non-hepatic disease. Baseline tests (hematology, serum biochemistries and urinalysis) are useful in initial screening to
look for evidence of hepatic disease as well as other abnormalities (Figure 1).

Serum bile acid analysis is a sensitive and specific indicator of hepatic function, useful for the diagnosis of subclinical liver diseases and portosystemic shunts. Measurement of fasting serum ammonia can document the presence of HE. Coagulation tests are indicated in animals with

Operative mesenteric portography can visualize vascular anomalies; nuclear hepatic scintigraphy is non-invasive but
requires specialized equipment and the use of radioactive tracers.

Biopsy
Histologic examination of liver tissue is often essential to
clarify the cause of abnormal liver tests and/or size, to define whether it is a primary or secondary problem, and determine hepatic copper levels. It may also be used to monitor
progression or response to treatment when non-invasive
testing is inadequate.

Causes
> Non-infectious inflammatory liver diseases

Liver

These represent one of the most common manifestations of liver disease in the dog (Table 3)
(Center, 1996a; Watson, 2004). The liver has a very active reticuloendothelial system and plays
an important role in blocking substances from the gastrointestinal tract that have been transported by the portal vein. The liver is also sensitive to endogenous and exogenous toxins, and drugs.
Immune-mediated mechanisms may furthermore lead to the perpetuation of inflammation following hepatic damage caused by any agent (Center, 1999b). Primary autoimmune hepatitis, which
is an important disease in humans, has however not been conclusively demonstrated to exist in
dogs.
> Infectious inflammatory liver diseases

Viral causes are not important in dogs, in contrast to man. However, infections with ‘atypical’ leptospires (i.e. those not covered in routine vaccinations) may be a more significant cause of chronic hepatitis than previously assumed (Adamus et al, 1997; Bishop et al, 1979).
> Non-inflammatory liver diseases

Clinically more important are liver diseases related to vascular anomalies, such as congenital portosystemic shunts and portal hypoplasia (e.g. microvascular dysplasia and juvenile fibrosing liver
disease). Neoplasia, commonly secondary, is less frequent.

© C. Rutgers

Vacuolar hepatopathies are a vague term used to describe a non-inflammatory liver disease that
occurs in conjunction with cytoplasmic vacuoles in hepatocytes (Cullen, 2001). Generally, vacuole formation is a nonspecific response to hepatic injury, with glucocorticoid excess (either endogenous or exogenous) the main cause in dogs.

The cause of chronic hepatitis in dogs is usually unknown. Some breeds are however
more likely to suffer from chronic hepatitis than others (Table 4). A familial predisposition has been described in Bedlington Terriers, West Highland White Terriers,
Skye Terriers, Doberman Pinschers, Cocker Spaniels and Labrador Retrievers (Johnson, 2000). The increased incidence of chronic hepatitis in certain breeds suggests a
possible genetic basis.

So far, the genetic defect has only been demonstrated in copper storage hepatopathy
in the Bedlington (Johnson et al, 1980). In this breed, copper storage hepatopathy is
autosomal recessive.
Copper accumulates in the liver due to an inherited metabolic defect in biliary copper excretion; the increased hepatic copper content then causes hepatocellular injury,
chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis (Twedt et al, 1979). The genetic defect was initially
demonstrated via a DNA microsatellite marker (Yusbasiyan-Gurkan et al, 1997; Holmes
et al, 1998; Rothuizen et al, 1999), but recently the locus of the abnormal copper toxicosis gene has been identified (van De Sluijs et al, 2002). Biopsy and determination of
hepatic copper content are still essential for the diagnosis, although a DNA microsatellite marker test is now available to detect both affected and carrier Bedlington Terriers. This test is not 100% accurate (due to recombination), but offers a simple procedure that can be used by breeders to reduce the incidence of this disease.

It is sometimes difficult to establish whether copper accumulation in the hepatocytes
is a cause of hepatic disease or a consequence of reduced biliary excretion of copper
(Rolfe & Twedt, 1995; Thornburg, 2000). Copper accumulation in association with
liver disease has been especially demonstrated in Doberman Pinschers, Dalmatians,
West Highland White Terriers and Skye Terriers (Rolfe & Twedt, 1995). The mode of
inheritance in these breeds is as yet unknown (Rolfe & Twedt, 1995; Webb et al, 2002).
Chronic hepatitis in Cocker Spaniels is often associated with copper accumulation
(Johnson, 2000). The copper-storage hepatopathy that was described in young Dalmatians may share some similarities with the disease in Bedlington Terriers, but this needs
further investigation (Webb et al, 2002).
Chronic hepatitis in Doberman Pinschers is
associated with increased liver levels of copper and
iron, which is a consequence of reduced biliary
copper excretion that has a different genetic basis
than the disease in Bedlington terriers
(Spee et al, 2005).

> Portovascular anomalies

Congenital intrahepatic portosystemic shunts are more common in large breed dogs.
They have been shown to be autosomal recessive inherited in Irish Wolfhounds
(Rothuizen et al, 2001). In contrast, most congenital extrahepatic shunts occur in small
dogs. They are inherited via a polygenic trait in Cairn Terriers (Rothuizen et al, 2001),
and are likely to be inherited in Yorkshire Terriers (Tobias, 2003; Tobias & Rohrbach,
2003).

Portal vein hypoplasia (microvascular dysplasia) occurs more commonly in small breed dogs (Van
den Ingh et al, 1995). Yorkshire and Cairn Terriers are both predisposed to congenital portosystemic shunts as well as microvascular dysplasia.
> Drugs

Certain therapeutic agents may provide a risk factor for development of acute or chronic liver
disease. Chronic hepatitis has been most commonly associated with anticonvulsant drugs (primidone, phenobarbital, phenytoin), and diethylcarbamazine oxibendazole. Acute toxic injury has
been described with several drugs, including carprofen, mebendazole and potentiated sulfonamides
(trimethoprim-sulfadiazine) (Hooser, 2000; Trepanier et al, 2003). In addition, excess glucocorticosteroids, either exogenous or endogenous as in hyperadrenocorticism, frequently cause a typical vacuolar hepatopathy (steroid hepatopathy).

3 - Physiopathology

3 - Physiopathology
Hepatocellular dysfunction can cause multiple metabolic disturbances, which are compounded
by malnutrition.

Liver

Hepatocellular dysfunction is associated with a number of metabolic disturbances that alter the
utilization of nutrients (Table 5). Alterations in protein, carbohydrate and fat metabolism reflect
the influence of neuroendocrine mediators and are particularly prominent in the fasting state.
Serum concentrations of glucagon and insulin are increased due to reduced hepatic degradation,
with the effects of hyperglucagonemia predominating. This causes a more rapid depletion of
hepatic glycogen stores, which results in premature protein catabolism to supply amino acids for
gluconeogenesis. Fasting hypoglycemia is in many cases prevented by a compensatory decrease in
peripheral glucose oxidation and increase in gluconeogenesis. Peripheral lipolysis is also enhanced, generating fatty acids for energy production (Marks et al, 1994). Prolonged inadequate food
intake in dogs with chronic liver disease will therefore result in progressive loss of fat and muscle,
which contributes to the malnutrition found commonly in liver disease (Figure 2).

The liver has a large functional reserve and is able to
preserve homeostasis and minimize catabolism for a
long time, despite extensive damage. The appearance
of metabolic alterations and clinical signs of liver dysfunction usually signify advanced disease.

disease results in more rapid depletion of hepatic glycogen stores, and glucose needs are then supplied through
catabolism of muscle proteins to amino acids. This
causes muscle wasting and increases the nitrogen load, which may potentiate hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy (Bauer, 1996). Fasting hypoglycemia may
occur in severe acute liver disease and portosystemic shunts due to inadequate glycogen storage and gluconeogenesis. In contrast, a mild hyperglycemia can occur in cirrhosis due to reduced hepatic clearance of glucocorticosteroids.
Lipid – The liver has an important function in the synthesis, oxidation and transport
of lipids. Liver disease causes an increase in peripheral lipolysis in order to generate
fatty acids for energy production, resulting in fat depletion, while the rate of hepatic
fatty acid oxidation increases (Bauer, 1996).

Microscopic view of hepatic glycogen reserves
(PSA X 40).

Through its synthesis of bile acids and secretion of bile, the liver plays an important
role in the digestion and absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Fat
malabsorption is nevertheless not common in liver disorders, since some dietary tri
glycerides still can be absorbed in the complete absence of bile acids (Gallagher et al,
1965).

In severe cholestatic liver disease, the reduced availability of enteric bile acids can cause malabsorption of fats, fat-soluble vitamins and some minerals. The liver is the only site of cholesterol
synthesis. Hypocholesterolemia may occur in acute liver failure and portosystemic shunts, whereas hypercholesterolemia is seen in obstructive jaundice.
Protein – The liver has an essential role in protein synthesis and degradation. It controls serum
concentrations of most amino acids, with the exception of branched chain amino acids (BCAA),
which are regulated by skeletal muscle. The liver synthesizes the majority of circulating plasma
proteins and is the only site of albumin synthesis.
Albumin has a relative priority for synthesis; hypoalbuminemia does not occur until the disease is chronic, and is compounded by malnutrition.
The liver furthermore synthesizes the majority of coagulation factors. Lack of synthesis in liver
failure may lead to prolonged coagulation times ( PT, PTT) but only when factors are reduced to less than 30% of normal. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is however the
most common coagulopathy associated with liver disease, and is most likely to cause spontaneous
hemorrhage (Center, 1999b). Decreased absorption of vitamin K in chronic biliary obstruction
may also lead to prolonged clotting times, but these can be corrected by parenteral administration
of vitamin K1.

THE LIVER CONTROLS MANY
METABOLIC FUNCTIONS.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT:
- maintains homeostasis of blood levels of glucose,
amino acids and trace elements
- synthesizes albumin and coagulation factors
- detoxifies and excretes endogenous and
exogenous waste products (i.e. NH3, drugs
and toxins
- regulates immune function
- regulates hormone balance.

Protein catabolism is increased in all liver
diseases. Protein breakdown is augmented
in patients with infections or gastrointestinal
hemorrhage, which can precipitate hepatic
encephalopathy due to increased ammonia
production.

The liver stores many vitamins and converts them to metabolically active forms. Liver
disease can therefore result in deficiency of vitamins stored in the liver, such as B-complex vitamins. Vitamin deficiencies are augmented by increased demands for hepatocyte regeneration, reduced metabolic activation and increased urinary losses. B-complex deficiencies are common in people with liver disease and probably also occur in dogs.
Vitamin C can be synthesized in dogs but is not stored. Its synthesis may be affected by liver disease
(Center, 1996a).

FIGURE 3 - MODE OF ACTION OF L-CARNITINE
1 - Mitochondria membrane
2 - L-carnitine

Mitochondria

L-carnitine is incorporated into the enzyme chain needed to convey long-chain fatty acids
though the mitochondrial membrane.
This permits the transfer of fatty acids to the interior of the mitochondria. In case of
deficiency, the transport system is disturbed and the production of energy is compromised.

141

Liver

L-carnitine is an essential cofactor for transport of long-chain fatty acids from the cytoplasm into mitochondria (Figure 3). The liver is a central organ for whole body L-carnitine homeostasis, and its metabolism can be impaired in multiple ways in chronic
liver disease. L-carnitine deficiency in liver disease may occur due to insufficient intake of carnitine or its precursors, reduced hepatic synthesis, or increased turnover (Krahenbuhl & Reichen, 1997). L-carnitine supplementation has a protective influence
against the development of ammonia-induced HE in experimental animals (Therrien
et al, 1997) and may be protective against the development of hepatic lipidosis in cats
(Twedt, 2004), but its usefulness in dogs is still undetermined.

3 - Physiopathology

In acute disease, functional proteins in skeletal muscle and other tissues are catabolized to meet the demands for synthesis of host defense proteins. In chronic liver disease, the etiology of the catabolic state is multifactorial (Mizock, 1999). Plasma concentrations of aromatic amino acids (AAA) increase in liver disease due to increased peripheral release and decreased hepatic clearance, but BCAA levels decrease because of
enhanced utilization as an energy source by muscle. This imbalance between AAA
and BCAA has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HE, although its significance
is now being questioned (Mizock, 1999).

3 - Physiopathology

Deficiencies of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K can occur in any condition that impairs the
enterohepatic circulation of bile acids or fat absorption. Deficiencies of vitamins E and K are most
significant. Vitamin E is an important antioxidant that protects lipoproteins and cell membranes
from lipid peroxidation. In addition, Vitamin E deficiency, common in chronic liver disease (Sokol,
1994), causes an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, which perpetuates ongoing liver injury. Vitamin K deficiency is best recognized in dogs, since it develops rapidly and is readily detectable by measurement of coagulation times (Leveille-Webster, 2000).

Liver

> Minerals and trace elements

Iron, zinc and copper are the main trace elements stored in the liver. Both iron and copper can
be hepatotoxic in high levels, but only copper appears to be a potential hepatotoxin in the dog.

Zinc deficiency is common in chronic liver disease,
due to poor dietary intake, reduced intestinal
absorption and increased urinary loss.
Deficiency results in low resistance to oxidative
stress and reduces ammonia detoxification in
the urea cycle, thus promoting hepatic
encephalopathy.

The liver is central to the maintenance of copper homeostasis, since it takes up most
of the absorbed copper and regulates the amount retained by controlling excretion
through the biliary tract. Copper may accumulate in the liver as a result of a primary
metabolic defect in copper metabolism, or secondary to decreased hepatic copper
excretion associated with longstanding cholestasis (Thornburg, 2000). In dogs with primary copper storage disease, copper accumulates in the liver before the development
of hepatic damage or cholestasis. Excessive hepatic copper accumulation in Bedlington Terriers has been shown to result in mitochondrial injury, generation of reactive
oxygen species and free radicals, and hepatocellular damage (Sokol et al, 1994).
Zinc is an essential cofactor in many biological processes. It has an antioxidant role,
anti-fibrotic properties, and enhances ureagenesis (Dhawan & Goel, 1995; Marchesini
et al, 1996).

Manganese is another trace element with antioxidant properties that can become deficient in
cirrhosis.
> Antioxidants

There is mounting evidence that free radicals play important roles in many liver diseases. They
damage cellular macromolecules via lipid peroxidation and other mechanisms, and can initiate
and perpetuate liver injury. Their production is increased in inflammation, cholestasis, immunological events, and exposure to heavy metals and toxins (Sokol et al, 1994; Feher et al, 1998). There
is a wide range of both dietary and endogenous enzymatic antioxidant defense systems that hold
the generation of free radicals in check. A disruption in this natural defense system results in
oxidant stress (Figure 4).
This type of disruption may occur during liver disease (Table 6).

Detoxification and excretion
The liver is the primary site of detoxification of both endogenous by-products of the intermediary metabolism (e.g. ammonia) and exogenous substances absorbed from the gastroinTABLE 6 - ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSES
testinal tract. All of these may play a role in the etiology of HE. The precise pathogenesis is likely to be multifactorial, and may be based on inter-related changes in reduced hepatic clearance of gut-derived substances such as ammonia, altered amino acid

4 - Adaptation of nutritional
intakes
Diets for animals with liver disease are best formulated on an individual
basis, with consideration given to the type and origin of the liver disease and the extent of liver dysfunction (Laflamme, 1999). Care must be
taken to avoid overwhelming the remaining metabolic capacities of the
diseased liver. The diet must be highly palatable and provide adequate
energy, protein, fat, and all essential micronutrients. It is furthermore
becoming increasingly evident that it is possible to modulate metabolic
and pathological processes through the use of specific nutrients and
metabolites.

THE AIMS OF DIETARY MANAGEMENT
OF LIVER DISEASE ARE:
(1) to supply adequate energy and nutrients to fulfill basic
requirements and prevent malnutrition
(2) to limit further liver damage by preventing accumulation
of copper and free radicals
(3) to support hepatocellular regeneration
(4) to prevent or minimize metabolic complications,
such as hepatic encephalopathy and ascites

FIGURE 4 - ETIOLOGY OF OXIDANT STRESS IN LIVER DISEASE

4 - Adaptation of nutritional intakes

Liver

Dogs with liver disease are usually catabolic
and have increased energy requirements.

Provision of adequate high-quality proteins as
well as calories is essential to ensure a positive
protein balance and enable hepatic regeneration.
Protein levels are often inappropriately restricted
in dogs with liver disease in order to manage
possible hyperammonemia. In fact, protein
requirements are at least normal or even
increased, and many dogs with liver disease
do not have hyperammonemia.

Correction and prevention of malnutrition are essential in the management of dogs
with liver disease. Impaired dietary intake, malabsorption associated with severe cholestasis or portal hypertension, and catabolism all contribute to protein-calorie malnutrition, resulting in loss of muscle mass and hypoalbuminemia. Negative protein and
energy balance promote HE, reduce immune response and increase mortality (Center,
1998). Providing several small meals daily as well as a bedtime snack will improve
nitrogen balance and carbohydrate availability. Tube feeding via a nasogastric, esophagostomy or gastrostomy tube may be required in dogs that are anorexic for more
than 3-5 days.

Energy
An adequate supply of both energy and protein is essential to prevent weight loss. The
use of non-protein calories is important to prevent the use of amino acids for energy
and reduce the need for gluconeogenesis. The diet should have a high energy density,
since dogs with liver disease usually have reduced appetites. Normal daily maintenance needs in the dog are 110-130 kcal ME/kg0.75 (Table 7) (Bauer, 1996).

Normally, energy is best supplied in the form of fat since it is a highly palatable and
concentrated source of energy. The diet’s caloric density is proportional to its fat content. Dogs
with liver disease can tolerate larger quantities of fat in the diet (30-50% of calories) than previously assumed (Biourge, 1997).

Altered carbohydrate metabolism in dogs with liver disease can induce either hyper- or hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may be seen in acute fulminant liver disease, whereas hyperglycemia is infrequently seen in dogs with cirrhosis. Carbohydrates should not represent more than 45% of dietary calories, especially in dogs with cirrhosis, which may be glucose intolerant. Boiled white rice,
and to a lesser degree pasta, are useful because of their high digestibility. Soluble fibers are useful
in dogs with cirrhosis and a tendency to hyperglycemia, because they smoothen the postprandial
glycemic response and prolong glucose delivery to the liver (Center, 1998).

Protein
> Dietary protein level

Incorrect protein restriction in dogs with liver disease causes catabolism of endogenous proteins
and loss of muscle mass, both of which increase the potential for HE. Feeding of excessive and/or
poor quality protein should also be avoided since this may aggravate signs of HE. In dogs, protein
should represent as a minimum 10 to 14% of dietary calories, preferably at least 20%, and most
dogs can tolerate higher quantities (Biourge, 1997; Laflamme, 1999). The aim is to gradually
increase the amount of protein in the diet, keeping the protein intake as close to normal as can
be tolerated without precipitating signs of HE (Michel, 1995).
> Protein type

The quality and source of the protein are important. High-quality proteins are better digested
(Figure 6) and have an amino acid content close to the animal’s requirements. Proteins of animal origin used to be considered as having a higher quality than proteins of plant origin, but soy
isolates, wheat gluten and dairy products are better tolerated than meat proteins in people with
HE, and this is probably also the case in dogs (Strombeck et al, 1983). The potential benefit of
vegetable proteins is attributed to their high fiber content, which causes a decrease in transit time
and promotes incorporation and excretion of nitrogen in fecal bacteria, whereas the effect of dairy
products is likely due to the influence of lactose on intestinal transit and pH (Center, 1998). The

benefit of soy and dairy proteins cannot be attributed to their amino acid composition, since this
is similar to that of meat and fish proteins. Exclusive use of soybean or lactose-containing dairy
protein diets is generally not advocated in dogs, since they have low palatability and can cause
diarrhea, although this is less significant when purified proteins are used.
> The role of branched chain amino acids

BCAA supplementation has been used to improve protein and energy utilization and HE in people
with advanced liver disease, since a decreased plasma ratio of BCAA to AAA has been considered an important pathogenetic factor in HE. Results however have been mixed (Als-Nielsen et al,
2003; Marchesini et al, 2003), and it is now thought that any beneficial effect of BCAA supplementation is mostly related to improvement of the nutritional status, likely due to a stimulating
effect on hepatocyte growth factor, favoring liver regeneration (Bianchi et a, 2005). A study in
dogs showed no efficacy on HE from a diet high in BCAA and low in AAA, and it was concluded that the total protein intake was more important than dietary amino acid profile (Meyer et al,
1999). At present, BCAA supplements are unlikely to be of benefit in the management of canine liver disease, in view of their expense and questionable efficacy.

Fiber
Moderate quantities of dietary fiber can have several beneficial effects in liver disease. Soluble fiber
is of particular benefit in managing HE. Colonic fermentation of soluble fibers such as fructo-oligosaccharides, beet pulp and gums lowers the intraluminal pH and thus reduces the production
and absorption of ammonia, the effect of which is similar to that of lactulose. Colonic fermentation also favors the growth of acidophilic bacteria that produce less ammonia and promote incorporation and excretion of ammonia in fecal bacteria (e.g. Lactobacillus spp). Fiber (both soluble
and insoluble) binds bile acids in the intestinal lumen and promotes their excretion. Insoluble
fibers (lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose) act by normalizing transit time, whereas they can also prevent constipation and bind toxins. Diets containing soluble fiber and some insoluble fiber should
therefore be useful in the long-term dietary management of dogs with HE (Marks et al, 1994; Center, 1998).

Minerals
> Potassium

Hypokalemia is a common precipitating cause of HE in dogs with liver disease (Center, 1998). It
occurs due to a combination of anorexia, vomiting or diarrhea, or excessive use of diuretics in the
management of ascites. Diets for dogs with liver disease should therefore be potassium replete.
Anorectic dogs may need supplementation by either intravenous administration of potassium
chloride (10-40 mEq/500 ml fluids, depending on serum potassium) or oral potassium gluconate
(0.5 mEq/kg once or twice daily). Potassium citrate should be avoided because of its alkanizing
properties, since alkalosis can aggravate HE.
> Sodium

Abnormalities in sodium balance are less frequent, but moderate restriction of dietary sodium (less
than 0.5 g/1000 kcal) is recommended in dogs with ascites and/or portal hypertension.

Trace elements
> Zinc

Zinc is an essential trace metal involved in many metabolic and enzymatic functions of the body.
Zinc benefits the urea cycle and central nervous system neurotransmission, has clear hepatoprotective effects against a variety of hepatotoxic agents, and has antioxidant functions (Marchesini
et al, 1996). Diets high in zinc (>43 mg/1000 kcal) are therefore useful for all patients with liver
disease. Additional zinc supplementation may furthermore be useful to prevent hepatic copper
146

Many liver diseases result in increased generation
of free radicals and oxidant stress.
Supplementation with antioxidants will
therefore help to reduce oxidative liver injury.

> Copper
Zinc supplementation may reduce lipid
peroxidation, has antifibrotic properties,
prevents hepatic copper accumulation, and can
reduce the severity of hepatic encephalopathy.

Diets low in copper are recommended for dog breeds known to be prone to hepatic
copper accumulation, especially Bedlington Terriers, and for dogs with documented
increased hepatic copper (Table 8). Restriction of dietary copper in itself does little to
lower increased hepatic copper levels, but it is an additional adjunct to decoppering
therapy such as d-penicillamine and zinc.

Vitamins
> B Vitamins

B Vitamins are often empirically supplemented at double maintenance dose, based upon recommendations for people with liver disease.

The diet should contain adequate levels of vitamin C in order to compensate for failing hepatic

synthesis and to take advantage of the antioxidant properties of vitamin C. Most commercial pet
foods contain adequate amounts, and additional supplementation should only be necessary in case
of severe fat malabsorption (Laflamme, 1999). Mega doses of vitamin C should be avoided in dogs
with copper storage hepatotoxicity, since it can function as a pro-oxidant in the presence of high
concentrations of heavy metals (Sokol, 1996).

147

Liver

Dietary supplementation with zinc in patients with severe liver disease is done empirically with doses similar to those used in dogs with copper hepatopathies. Zinc is available as zinc acetate (2-4 mg/kg per day), sulfate, gluconate (3 mg/kg per day) and
methionine. It is administered divided into two or three daily doses, and can be used
as a dietary supplement (Brewer et al, 1992). Zinc should be given on an empty stomach and should not be given in combination with copper chelators. Toxicity other
than occasional vomiting is minimal and the acetate salt may cause fewer GI signs.

accumulation in copper hepatotoxicosis, since dietary zinc induces an increase in the intestinal
metal-binding protein metallothionein. Dietary copper then binds to the metallothionein with a
high affinity that prevents its transfer from the intestine into the blood. When the
intestinal cells die and are sloughed, the metallothionein bound copper passes out
through the stool, thus blocking copper absorption (Sokol, 1996).

4 - Adaptation of nutritional intakes

Liver

> Vitamin E

Vitamin E is an important endogenous free radical scavenger that protects against oxidative injury. There is evidence that oxidative damage from free radical formation plays an important role
in the pathogenesis of liver disease. In particular, abnormal concentrations of bile acids, accumulation of heavy metals such as copper and iron, and inflammation can cause free radical generation and oxidant stress in the liver. Supplementation with vitamin E (400-600 IU/day) is especially indicated in cholestatic and copper-associated liver disease, but is likely also important in
other forms of chronic liver disease. In severe cholestatic disease parenteral administration or an
oral water-soluble form is preferred, since a certain level of enteric bile acids are required for its absorption.
Vitamin E supplementation can reduce
free radical or oxidant injury in many types
of liver disease and may prevent progression
of disease.

> Vitamin K

Vitamin K deficiency is mostly relevant in cholestatic disorders, although it may also
become depleted in severe chronic liver disease. Vitamin deficiency is documented by
demonstration of prolonged coagulation times and normalization after parenteral
administration of vitamin K1. Coagulopathies secondary to vitamin K deficiency
should be treated with two or three doses of vitamin K1 (0.5-1.0 mg/kg subcutaneously
every 12 hours) (Laflamme, 1999). The same dose can be given biweekly or monthly
in chronic disorders in which continued repletion of vitamin K is required.

4E - Antioxidants
Chronic hepatitis and fibrosis, cholestatic liver disease and heavy metal hepatotoxicity are all
known to be associated with increased generation of free radicals,
and this is likely also the case in other types of liver disease (Britton & Bacon, 1994; Feher et al, 1998). Adequate dietary levels of
antioxidants such as vitamins E and C, as well as taurine, are essenFIGURE 7 - CELLULAR FREE RADICAL SCAVENGERS

antioxidants is better than a single one, since they appear to act
synergistically (Figure 7). A good balanced diet should also

The intake of highly diverse antioxidants acting in synergy helps

148

S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) may also be helpful in reducing
oxidative injury (Davidson, 2002). It is a precursor of glutathione,
an important hepatic antioxidant enzyme that is often reduced in
dogs with liver disease. Oral administration helps to replenish
hepatic glutathione stores and may thus improve antioxidant
function. In addition, SAMe has anti-inflammatory properties
(Center et al, 2002).
Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a phospholipid that is one of the
components of bile required for normal bile acid transport and a
building block for cell membranes. Its hepatoprotective actions are
thought to be by improvement of membrane integrity and function (Twedt, 2004). Based on its multiple mechanisms of action,
this nutrient may be beneficial for chronic liver disease associated
with oxidative stress, but it has not yet been validated for use in
dogs.
Silymarin is the active component of milk thistle, and is thought
to have antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties for
various types of liver disease, as well as a protective agent against
various hepatotoxicities (Saller et al, 2001). There are currently
limited clinical studies evaluating its efficacy in dogs with liver
disease. Suggested doses range from 50 to 250 mg/day (Twedt,
2004).

Acute liver diseases
Acute liver disease is most commonly caused by toxic injury, and less frequently by infection (e.g.
infectious canine hepatitis, sepsis), trauma, heat stroke, or vascular compromise (Center, 1996b).
The spectrum of disease can range widely, and signs vary from mild to fulminant hepatic failure.
Vomiting and diarrhea are common, whereas HE, melena, hematochezia, and DIC may occur in
acute liver failure.
Stabilization - Fluid therapy with a balanced electrolyte solution is necessary for initial stabilization. Potassium and glucose should be supplemented as appropriate, and
correction may reduce the severity of HE. Vomiting may be controlled by anti-emetics (metoclopramide, 0.2-0.5 mg/kg q 6-8h IV, IM, PO), whereas gastroprotectants
(ranitidine 2 mg/kg q 8-12h IV, PO) are indicated in dogs with bloody vomiting and/or
diarrhea. Treatment of HE may be needed as outlined below, using lactulose and oral
antibiotics.

Dogs with acute liver disease are typically
hypercatabolic and need prompt nutritional
intervention in order to prevent debilitating
malnutrition. The liver has tremendous
regenerative capacities, but this is dependent
on the availability of sufficient nutrients.

> Enteral nutrition

Enteral nutrition via tube feeding of frequent meals (3-6 hrs) should be instituted when the dog
remains anorexic after 48 to 72 hours (Michel, 1995), provided there is no intractable vomiting.
Tube feeding is usually first started using a naso-esophageal tube; esophagostomy or gastrostomy
tubes may have to be used at a later stage when the dog remains anorexic (see chapter 14).
> Dietary management

Oral feeding should be started gradually with small frequent meals in order not to overload the
liver’s metabolic capacity. Half of the daily requirements should be fed initially, and this should
be increased by 10% every day dependent upon the dog’s response. The diet should contain normal amounts of protein (20%) if at all possible, since a positive nitrogen balance is essential for
hepatic regeneration. Protein tolerance can be augmented by increasing caloric content (for instance by mixing a hepatic support diet with a convalescence diet) and/or using drugs to counteract hepatic encephalopathy (e.g. lactulose, oral antibiotics). Moderate protein restriction may be
necessary in patients with persistent HE. However, in acute liver disease it is especially important
not to over-restrict dietary protein, since this could result in endogenous ammonia production
from protein catabolism as well as a reduction in the availability of protein for hepatocellular
repair. The source of protein is also important, with milk and soy protein being better tolerated
than animal protein.
The diet should also include free radical scavengers and antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin
C and SAMe. Ursodesoxycholic acid (10-15 mg/kg PO q24h) can be given as a hepatoprotectant
in the subacute stage when serum bile acids remain high.

Chronic hepatitis includes a diverse group of disorders characterized by mixed inflammatory cell
infiltrates, in which lymphocytes and plasma cells predominate (Center, 1996b; Johnson, 2000).
The etiology is often never determined. Documented causes include abnormal hepatic copper
accumulation and drug- or toxin-induced hepatic injury (anticonvulsants). The presence of lymphocytic-plasmacytic infiltrates may be suggestive of an immune-mediated mechanism, but this is
difficult to distinguish from immunological disease that occurs secondary to hepatocellular injury, due to release of liver antigens and subsequent antibody formation. The use of immunosuppressive therapy remains therefore limited to the few cases with clear lymphocytic-plasmacytic
inflammation of unknown etiology (Center, 1996a,b), especially since immunosuppressents may
have detrimental effects on liver function.

Remember that glucocorticoids can have side-effects that may impact dietary needs, e.g. by aggravating HE, ascites, glucose intolerance and/or gastric ulceration (Laflamme, 1999). This
disease is usually in an advanced stage when recognized, and prognosis is guarded.
Dietary management – Nutritional therapy is particularly important in chronic liver
disease. The amount fed should at first be based on an estimation of the patient’s energy
requirements (Table 7).

hepatitis, showing periportal inflammation with
mononuclear inflammatory cells (H&E).

Every effort should be made to get the dog to eat voluntarily. Food should be palatable,
at room temperature and be fed in small portions 3 to 6 times daily. Dogs that refuse
to eat or consume insufficient amounts to meet minimum requirements may require
tube feeding, usually initially via a nasogastric tube, in order to halt the vicious cycle
of excessive muscle catabolism and worsening signs of liver dysfunction. If the dog
remains anorexic, esophagostomy or gastrostomy tubes may have to be inserted in order
to ensure continuing nutritional adequacy (see chapter 14).
> Protein

REVERSIBILITY OF PROBLEMS
Dietary management of dogs with
chronic liver disease aims to
maintain adequate body condition
in order to support hepatic
regeneration and reduce signs
of hepatic encephalopathy.

Dietary protein should ideally represent 17-20% of metabolic energy, be highly digestible and of high biological value. Protein restriction should only be instituted when there are
signs of HE. Protein tolerance can be increased by administering lactulose (0.5 ml/kg orally three
times daily), which may be combined with oral antibiotics (metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg q 12hr, or
ampicillin 20 mg/kg q 8hr). Increasing dietary levels of vegetable, soy or dairy protein may also
help to reduce the likelihood of HE.
Assessment of the protein-calorie adequacy of the diet is generally based upon weekly monitoring
of body weight and serum albumin concentrations. Progressive hypoalbuminemia (in absence of
proteinuria) is indicative of protein malnutrition and/or progressive liver disease.
> Fiber

The diet should contain both soluble fiber, in order to promote an acidic colonic pH and decrease NH4+ absorption, and insoluble fiber, which helps to normalize transit time, prevent constipation and bind toxins. Foods low in fiber can be supplemented with psyllium (1 tsp per 5 to 10 kg
bodyweight per meal).
> Minerals and vitamins

It is essential that the diet contains increased zinc levels and a mixture of antioxidants including
vitamins E and C. Additional oral zinc supplementation (zinc acetate 2 mg/kg daily)
may be helpful because it is an antioxidant that also has antifibrotic properties and can
reduce the severity of HE.

Copper toxicosis

Bedlington Terriers suffering from copper
intoxication syndrome may present toxic liver
copper concentrations from age 2 to 4 years
(Twedt et al, 1979).

150

Bedlington Terriers affected with primary copper toxicosis develop progressive liver
disease and die within a few years. This disease in Bedlington Terriers has similarities
to Wilson’s disease in man but differs clinically and genetically (Brewer, 1998; Muller
et al, 2003); the treatment is however similar. The role of copper in other breeds is less
clear, although it is thought that in some breeds copper accumulation may contribute
to the development of liver disease (e.g. West Highland White Terriers, Doberman Pinschers and Dalmatians) (Rolfe & Twedt, 1995; Webb et al, 2002; Spee et al, 2005). Quantitative determination of liver copper levels as well as histopathologic assessment is
important in differentiating primary copper storage disease from secondary copper
retention due to cholestasis. Dogs with secondary copper accumulates tend to have
lower concentrations in the liver, rarely exceeding 2000 ppm, and a different localization of copper within the lobule (Center, 1996b; Rolfe & Twedt, 1995).

Dogs with severely increased liver copper levels (> 2000 ppm; normal less than 400 ppm) should
be partially decoppered for 2-4 months using a copper chelator such as D-penicillamine (1015 mg/kg orally q 12hr). Subsequently, treatment with oral zinc, which blocks intestinal copper
absorption by induction of copper-binding metallothionein, is continued lifelong (Brewer et al,
1992). Treatment of dogs with secondary copper retention involves addressing the primary cause,
as well as measures to reduce the accumulated copper.
Prevention – Diets low in copper are essential in breeds known to accumulate copper or that have
increased concentrations on biopsy. Bedlington Terriers that have been genetically assessed as
being at risk of developing copper hepatotoxicosis should be fed a low-copper diet from a young
age since copper accumulation happens early in life. Other foodstuffs (e.g. shellfish, liver), mineral supplements or water with a high copper concentration should also be avoided (Table 8). DNA
testing may help to identify affected and/or carrier Bedlingtons.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE)
HE is a metabolic disorder affecting the central nervous system, which develops secondary to hepatic disease (Maddison, 2000). It is usually a result of congenital portovascular anomalies (congenital portosystemic shunts, microvascular dysplasia) and less commonly due to severe hepatocellular disease. Acquired shunts may occur in response to portal hypertension caused by severe chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and fibrosis, and will also predispose to development of HE. Rarely, HE is
due to urea cycle deficiencies as reported in Irish Wolfhounds (Rothuizen et al, 2001). Signs are
typically intermittent, may be precipitated by a high-protein meal, and vary from anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea and polyuria/polydipsia to disorientation, apparent blindness and seizures. Stunted
growth or failure to gain weight may occur in young dogs with congenital portovascular shunts.
A high index of clinical suspicion is important, since appropriate management of HE will greatly improve the patient’s demeanor and may restore appetite.
> Dietary modification

• Protein quantity
Dogs with HE are initially offered a highly digestible, protein-restricted diet (around 15 % ME),
in combination with medication aimed at reducing ammonia production and colonic absorption
(lactulose; oral antibiotics such as metronidazole or ampicillin) (Figure 8). High diet digestibility as well as the addition of moderate amounts of fermentable fibers is of added benefit in regulating the intestinal microflora. Frequent, small meals should be fed in order to limit the time between meals, which improves nutritional status and reduces catabolism (Laflamme, 1999). If the
patient becomes neurologically asymptomatic, protein quantity is gradually and cautiously increased at weekly or biweekly intervals. Normal or near-normal maintenance protein requirements
should be fed unless the animal again becomes encephalopathic, and in that case the medical
treatment ought to be reinstituted and/or intensified. Serum proteins should be monitored to prevent hypoalbuminemia, in which case dietary protein content is increased in association with
more aggressive adjunctive treatment. In dogs with refractory HE, protein quality may be modified by replacing animal proteins with vegetable (soy) and/or dairy proteins.

Maintenance of muscle mass and
a positive nitrogen balance is
essential in reducing the risk of
hepatic encephalopathy (HE).
Dietary protein should be restricted
only as needed to prevent HE.
Correction of enteric bleeding,
constipation, infection, alkalosis,
hypokalemia and azotemia is also
important in reducing the risk of HE.

• Protein quality
In addition to a protein-restricted diet and adjunct medication, it can be helpful to replace meat
proteins with highly digestible vegetable (e.g. soy isolate) and/or milk proteins (e.g. casein, cottage cheese) (Strombeck et al, 1983; Center, 1998).

5 - Nutritional management adapted to the type of liver disease

Dietary management – Diets for dogs with copper hepatotoxicosis should be low in copper while
high in zinc, contain increased vitamin B levels and adequate levels of high quality proteins. Many
canine diets contain copper well above the minimum required amount, and it is important to
choose a diet with levels as low as possible. Feeding copper-restricted diets slows hepatic copper
accumulation but does little to lower liver copper levels in already diseased dogs with large
amounts of hepatic copper accumulation.

Adjunct treatment
Modify protein type

Protein restriction

Adjunct medical therapy can increase protein tolerance. Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide that is fermented in the colon, resulting in colonic acidification and
reduced ammonia absorption. The starting dose is 0.250.5 ml/kg two to three times daily, which is titrated to
produce two soft stools daily.
Oral antibiotics (e.g. metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg q 8-12 hr
or ampicillin 20 mg/kg q 8hr) are given during severe
encephalopathic episodes in order to modify the enteric microbial flora that is responsible for the generation
of ammonia and other toxins.

Homemade versus
commercial diets

Commercial diets are preferred above homemade ones because they are nutritionally complete.
Veterinary diets formulated for dogs with hepatic insufficiency are now available and meet the
specific nutritional requirements of the liver patient. It is difficult to create homemade diets that
are balanced enough to be used for prolonged periods (Laflamme, 1999).
In general, diets for dogs with liver disease should be highly digestible with a high energy density
provided by fat and carbohydrates (Table 9). Moderate protein restriction may be necessary in
dogs with clinically evident HE, but protein quality should be very high. In addition, the diet
should contain high normal to increased levels of water-soluble vitamins, enhanced zinc
(>43 mg/1000kcal), restricted copper, restricted sodium (<0.5 g Na/1000 kcal) in case of ascites,
and a moderate amount of mostly soluble fiber. Protein restriction should be avoided as much as
possible, especially in dogs with acute inflammatory hepatic disease or necrosis.

Frequently asked questions
- Nutrition of dogs with liver disease

A

Q
Dogs with liver disease often have
a decreased appetite or are anorexic. How can they be stimulated
to eat?

The liver biopsy of a seven-yearold Golden Retriever showed chronic hepatitis and copper accumulation.
Is this copper important?

Are antioxidants important in
managing liver disease?

Should dogs with liver disease be
fed a protein-restricted diet?

The diet must be highly palatable and high in energy, and provide adequate protein, fat, and
all essential micronutrients. Feeding small amounts frequently and slightly warming canned
food can increase palatability.
Tube feeding, initially via a nasogastric tube, may be required in dogs that are anorexic for more
than 3-5 days, since correction and prevention of malnutrition are essential to halt the vicious
cycle of excessive muscle catabolism and worsening signs of liver dysfunction.
Golden Retrievers are not known to have primary copper hepatotoxicosis, and copper accumulation is probably a consequence of cholestatic liver disease resulting in decreased biliary
excretion of copper. Typically, these copper levels are not high enough to result in hepatocellular damage. However, zinc treatment together with measures for chronic liver disease will
help to prevent further copper accumulation.
Yes. There is mounting evidence that free radical production is increased in many liver diseases
and it can play an important role in initiating and perpetuating liver injury. Furthermore, endogenous antioxidant systems become depleted during liver disease, which aggravates the problem.
Supplementation with antioxidants such as vitamins E, C, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe)
helps to minimize oxidative injury. A combination of dietary antioxidants is better than a single
one, since they appear to act synergistically.

Not necessarily. Protein levels are often inappropriately restricted in order to manage possible
hyperammonemia. In fact, protein requirements are at least normal or even increased, and
many dogs with liver disease do not have hyperammonemia. Provision of adequate high-quality proteins as well as calories is essential to ensure a positive protein balance and enable hepatic regeneration. The aim is to keep the protein intake as close to normal as can be tolerated
without precipitating signs of hepatic encephalopathy (HE).
Protein restriction should only be instituted when there are signs of HE, and additional treatments such as lactulose and oral antibiotics can help to avoid excessive restriction of dietary
protein.

How should I feed a dog with
acute liver disease?

154

A dog with acute liver disease needs an ample supply of energy and protein to allow for hepatic regeneration. Protein should never be restricted; protein tolerance can be enhanced if
necessary by increasing caloric content and/or using drugs (lactulose, oral antibiotics). The dog
should be fed small frequent meals in order not to overload the liver’s metabolic capacity. Tube
feeding should be considered if the dog remains anorexic for more than 72 hours.

The diet should have high palatability and energy density, contain normal levels of fat (which
provides energy as well as palatability), adequate levels of high quality protein (>14% of dietary calories, preferably >20%), be restricted in copper and sodium, and contain some fermentable fiber. In addition, the diet should have increased vitamin B and zinc levels, and a
mixture of antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E, C and S-adenosylmethionine).
Zinc supplementation is useful because it is an antioxidant, reduces copper accumulation in
the liver, can reduce the severity of HE and has antifibrotic properties.

What are the dietary
recommendations for
a Bedlington Terrier with copper
hepatotoxicosis?

The diet should be low in copper while high in zinc, and contain adequate levels of high quality proteins. Many canine diets contain copper well above the minimum required amount,
and it is important to choose a diet with levels as low as possible. Feeding copper-restricted
diets slows hepatic copper accumulation but does little to lower liver copper levels in already
diseased dogs with large amounts of hepatic copper.
Additional treatment with a copper chelator (D-penicillamine) will be needed, followed by
life-long zinc therapy to prevent further copper accumulation.

Firstly, determine the cause – congenital portosystemic shunt or severe liver disease. Dietary
management should focus on providing adequate energy and adequate protein to support hepatic regeneration while preventing worsening of HE. Patients with signs of HE are initially offered a protein-restricted diet in combination with medication aimed at reducing colonic absorption of ammonia (lactulose, oral antibiotics).
How do I manage a dog with
hepatic encephalopathy?

Protein quantity is gradually increased at weekly or biweekly intervals when the dog becomes
neurologically asymptomatic. Serum proteins should be monitored to prevent hypoalbuminemia, in which case dietary protein content should be increased in association with more aggressive adjunct treatment.
When HE persists despite a protein-restricted diet and adjunct medication, it may be helpful
to replace meat proteins with highly digestible vegetable and/or milk proteins. Addition of
soluble fiber (psyllium 1-3 tsp mixed with food daily) can also help by acidifying colonic
contents and minimizing ammonia absorption.

Key Points
- Reduce the copper content to limit the risk
of copper accumulation in the liver
- Reduce the sodium content to reduce portal
hypertension and limit the loss of fluid through
the extra-luminal space
- Increase the energy level to prevent the risk of
excessive protein catabolism and combat hepatic
encephalopathy

*The rationing is offered in accordance with the dog’s healthy weight. In case of obesity, the rationing
must be prescribed in accordance with the ideal weight and not the real weight of the dog.
**The fractioning of the daily amount over two or three meals is recommended to limit the postprandial hepatic load.

It is important to serve several smaller meals over
the day while respecting the daily ration in order
to limit the postprandial hepatic load.

Key points
to remember:

Nutrition in the treatment and prevention
of liver diseases
The four objectives of nutritional
support for liver diseases in dogs are:
- Treating the malnutrition by
responding to the energy requirements in terms of essential
nutrients
- Favoring the regeneration of hepatocytes by ensuring the limited
intake of nutrients, particularly
proteins
- Limiting hepatic lesions by preventing the accumulation of copper
and capturing free radicals

160

160

- Preventing or minimizing complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension and ascites
Anorexia is a frequent consequence
of hepatopathies.
Tube feeding can be utilized to ensure an appropriate intake of energy
and nutrients.
Highly digestible vegetable or dairy
proteins are better tolerated than
animal proteins in animals suffering
from hepatic encephalopathy.

Nutritional support must be adapted
to the case, based on the type of
hepatopathy, the degree of hepatic
dysfunction, the tolerance to dietary
proteins and the animal’s nutritional
condition.
The length of the nutritional treatment is dependent on the cause of
the disease and the regeneration
capacity of the liver tissue. A lifelong prescription may prove necessary
in case of a chronic disease.

Focus on:

COPPER

- Copper is one of the anti-anemic
factors that also include folates,
vitamin B12 and iron. Copper facilitates the incorporation of iron in
hemoglobin.
- Copper helps the synthesis of collagen and myelin.
- Copper also plays a role in the synthesis of melanin, due to its tyrosinase coenzyme function.

- As a cofactor of superoxide dismutase (SOD), copper is an integrative
part of the oxidative stress defense
mechanisms.
Copper is absorbed and stored by
bonding with liver proteins: most of
the organism’s copper is stored in the
liver. This storage capacity is limited
and excess copper is eliminated by
the bile. Copper may be toxic when
accumulation is excessive, as in some
predisposed breeds.
The intestinal absorption of copper,
zinc and iron is interdependent. An
excessive iron or zinc level may reduce the availability of copper. In the

enterocytes zinc induces the synthesis of metallothioneine, a metalloprotein that forms a strong bond
with copper in the epithelial cells of
the intestine and prevents its absorption. Food high in zinc (> 40 mg
/1000 kcal) is therefore recommended for dogs with liver failure.

Liver

Although it is present in the organism in very low quantities (< 10 mg
/kg of body weight), copper plays the
role of coenzyme in a great many
metabolic reactions.

The role of nutrition in
the pathogenesis and the

pancreatic disorders
Kenneth W. SIMPSON
BVM&S, PhD, MRCVS, Dipl ACVIM, Dipl ECVIM-CA
Dr. Simpson graduated from the University of Edinburgh (BVM&S) in 1984. His PhD (University of Leicester, 1988) focused on
pancreatic and intestinal function in dogs, and was followed by clinical training at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Ohio State
University. He is presently an Associate Professor of Medicine at Cornell University with clinical and research interests in internal
medicine and gastroenterology.

T

he exocrine pancreas has an essential role in the digestion
and absorption of nutrients. Pancreatic acini synthesize and
secrete enzymes such as lipase, trypsin and amylase that digest
fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Pancreatic duct cells secrete
bicarbonate that maintains an optimal pH for digestive and
absorptive processes, and intrinsic factor that enables the
absorption of cobalamin (Vitamin B12). The exocrine pancreas
also produces bacteriostatic peptides and defensins that regulate
the upper GI flora, and has a role in maintenance of the
intestinal mucosa and glucose homeostasis.

Dysfunction of the exocrine pancreas is broadly characterized
by the loss of functional pancreatic mass (exocrine pancreatic
insufficiency), or inflammation (pancreatitis), with consequent
diarrhea and weight loss, or abdominal pain and vomiting
respectively. This chapter will outline the role of nutrition
in the pathogenesis and management of exocrine pancreatic
disease in the dog.

Diagnosis
> Overview

A diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is made on the basis of compatible historical and clinical findings (Table 1), and by ruling out infectious, parasitic, metabolic, and anatomic causes of small bowel diarrhea and weight loss. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating
a subnormal serum concentration of trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI), recently reviewed by
Westermarck & Wiberg (2003).

> Signs

Dogs with EPI usually present for investigation of chronic diarrhea (feces of large volume and cowpat consistency, often yellow to grey in color) (Figure 1) and weight loss (mild to extreme), which
is often associated with a ravenous appetite. Pica and coprophagia are also common. A poor haircoat (hair loss, eczema, dryness, scurf) polydipsia and marked muscle loss are observed in some dogs.

Polyuria and polydipsia may be present when exocrine pancreatic insufficiency caused by chronic
pancreatitis is complicated by diabetes mellitus. Acute abdomen due to mesenteric torsion has also
been associated with EPI.
> Supplementary tests

• Clinicopathological tests
Routine hematology and biochemistry are fairly unremarkable in dogs with EPI. Modest increases
in alanine amino-transferase (ALT) and a decrease in cholesterol are observed in some dogs. Panhypoproteinemia is not a feature of EPI, and its presence suggests that primary small intestinal
disease is causing the diarrhea and weight loss, rather than EPI.

Figure 1 - The feces of canine pancreatic
insufficiency patients are often of large
volume and cowpat consistency, and are
discolored and highly pungent.

The presence of hyperglycemia and glucosuria in dogs with signs of EPI should prompt consideration of diabetes mellitus secondary to chronic pancreatitis, or pancreatic hypoplasia.

163

1 - Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency

Serum concentrations of cobalamin (Vitamin B12) and Vitamins A and E can also be markedly
reduced in dogs with EPI. In contrast, serum folate concentration is often increased. Serum
concentrations of zinc and copper are decreased in dogs with experimental pancreatic insufficiency, whereas serum iron and transferrin saturation are increased.

• Specific diagnosis
The specific diagnosis of EPI is made by demonstrating a subnormal concentration of trypsin-like
immunoreactivity (TLI) in a fasted serum sample (Williams & Batt, 1988). Serum TLI is considered to originate solely from the pancreas and is an indicator of pancreatic mass and inflammation (Simpson et al, 1991).

Pancreas

In dogs with EPI caused by atrophy or chronic inflammation the amount of TLI leaking from the
pancreas into the circulation is reduced, and a subnormal TLI concentration can be demonstrated (Figure 2).

35.0

Healthy dogs usually have a fasting (overnight fast) TLI concentration greater than 5.0 µg/L
(normal range = 5-35 µg/L) whereas dogs with EPI caused by reduced pancreatic mass have
fasting concentrations < 2.5 µg/L. Where the TLI concentration is between 2.5-5.0 µg/L the
patient may be normal or have partial EPI and the test should be repeated after ensuring an
adequate fast.

DIAGNOSTIC PITFALLS
EPI must be distinguished from primary intestinal
disease.
The combination of diarrhea, weight loss, ravenous
appetite, and relatively normal laboratory findings,
often in a breed that is predisposed (e.g. German
Shepherd) (Figures 3 & 4), strongly suggests EPI
is a likely cause.
The presence of large bowel diarrhea, frequent
vomiting, pallor, jaundice, edema or ascites should
prompt consideration of other more likely diagnoses.
Hypoproteinemia is not a feature of uncomplicated
EPI and usually indicates a protein losing enteropathy.

Patients with persistently intermediate TLI concentrations are likely to have partial EPI that may progress to complete EPI (Wiberg et al, 1999a; Wiberg & Westermarck, 2002).
The TLI test is a simple and reliable way of confirming a diagnosis of EPI. However, if the TLI test result does not fit the patient’s clinical signs it is prudent to rerun the test after ensuring an overnight fast to rule out sampling/handling/technician error. The TLI test will not detect conditions that may cause the intra-luminal destruction of pancreatic enzymes e.g. hyperacidic states such as gastrinoma
and mast cell tumor, but these conditions have other diagnostic features such as
hematemesis and esophagitis to distinguish then from primary EPI.
> Decision tree

Do not rely solely on the TLI test result without other
supportive evidence of exocrine pancreatic disease.

The differential diagnosis of EPI includes other causes of small bowel diarrhea and
weight loss (Table 2).

FIGURE 5 - PHOTOGRAPHS OF EPI DUE
TO PANCRATIC ACINAR AND CHRONIC
ATROPHY AND CHRONIC
PANCREATITIS

Pancreatic acinar atrophy (PAA) is probably the most common cause of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in the dog (Figure 3). Dogs under five years of age diagnosed with EPI are usually suspected of having pancreatic acinar atrophy, whereas older
dogs likely have a higher incidence of pancreatitis induced degeneration (Hall et al,
1991). Dogs with chronic relapsing pancreatitis are considered at increased risk of
developing EPI.
> Breed predispositions

Pancreas

Many different breeds have been diagnosed with EPI (Figure 4).

5A - Chronic pancreatitis. Fibrosis and
atrophy are evident in this section from the
pancreas of a dog with EPI secondary to
pancreatitis (x10; H&E coloration).

A familial predisposition to pancreatic acinar atrophy has been reported in German
Shepherd Dogs, Collies and English Setters (Westermarck,1980; Boari et al, 1994;
Moeller et al, 2002; Wiberg, 2004). As it is impossible to determine the cause of atrophy in an end stage pancreas, prospective studies of the development of canine PAA
have been conducted. These longitudinal studies have identified German Shepherd
dogs and Rough Coated Collies with sub-clinical exocrine pancreatic insufficiency,
detected by assay of circulating TLI, in whom pancreatic atrophy is preceded by a marked lymphocytic infiltration (Westermarck et al, 1993a; Wiberg et al, 1999b, 2000).
This strongly suggests an autoimmune basis for PAA. There is no evidence that a lack
of trophic factors e.g. CCK, or anti-pancreatic antibodies play a role in the genesis of
PAA.
Breeds such as Miniature Schnauzers appear to be overrepresented with relapsing pancreatitis and may be predisposed to EPI.

5B - Lymphocytic inflammation precedes
the development of EPI in dogs with
familial acinar atrophy (x40; H&E
coloration).

Pathophysiological mechanisms of EPI
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in the dog is most often a consequence of a
severe reduction of pancreatic mass caused by pancreatic acinar atrophy, or chronic
pancreatitis (Figure 5).
Pancreatic hypoplasia with concomitant EPI and diabetes mellitus has been rarely
documented. In theory, EPI can also occur secondary to:
- the increased destruction, or decreased activity, of pancreatic enzymes in patients
with acid hypersecretion
- decreased synthesis and secretion of enzymes in the presence of severe malnutrition.

5C - Islet cells, stained for insulin (brown),
and surrounded by a sea of atrophied exocrine
tissue are relatively normal in dogs with EPI.
(Glucose tolerance is abnormal but
responds to enzyme supplementation- see
text for details) (x20; immunocoloration
for insulin).

Extensive loss of exocrine pancreatic mass (approx. 90%), whether by atrophy or chronic inflammation is required before signs of EPI are evident (Simpson et al, 1992). The
predominant clinical signs of EPI, diarrhea, weight loss and a ravenous appetite can
be directly attributed to decreased intra-duodenal concentrations of pancreatic
enzymes, bicarbonate, and various other factors with resultant malassimilation of fats,
carbohydrates and proteins (Figure 6).

Malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins and cobalamin, and changes in the number and
composition of the small intestinal bacterial flora have also been documented in dogs
with EPI and may contribute to their clinical condition (Williams et al, 1987; Westermarck et al, 1993b; Adamama-Moraitou et al, 2002). Subnormal serum concentrations of cobalamin are frequently documented (approximately 75% of cases) in dogs with EPI and are likely a
consequence of intrinsic factor deficiency, disrupted binding of cobalamin to IF (by intestinal pH,
lack of proteases) and bacterial consumption of cobalamin (Figure 7) (Batt et al, 1989; Simpson
et al, 1989a; Simpson et al, 1993).

166

Other abnormalities encountered in dogs with EPI include alterations in:
- glucose homeostasis (subclinical glucose intolerance) (Rogers et al, 1983)
- pancreatic and gastrointestinal regulatory peptides (e.g. vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide) (Hellmann et al, 1991)

FIGURE 7 - COBALAMIN ABSORPTION IN THE DOG
Liver

Following ingestion, cobalamin is released from
food in the stomach. It is then bound to a nonspecific cobalamin-binding protein of salivary
and gastric origin called haptocorrin. Intrinsic
factor (IF), a cobalamin binding protein that
promotes cobalamin absorption in the ileum, is
produced by the stomach and pancreas in dogs.
The affinity of cobalamin for haptocorrin is
higher at acid pH than for IF, so most is
bound to haptocorrin in the stomach.
Upon entering the duodenum haptocorrin is
degraded by pancreatic proteases, and cobalamin
is transferred from haptocorrin to IF, a process
facilitated by the high affinity of IF for
cobalamin at neutral pH. Cobalamin-IF
complexes traverse the intestine until they bind
to specific receptors (previously called IFCR,
but recently dubbed cubilin) located in the
microvillus pits of the apical brush-border
membrane of ileal enterocytes.
Cobalamin is then transcytosed to the portal
bloodstream and binds to a protein called
transcobalamin 2(TC II), which mediates
cobalamin absorption by target cells. A portion
of cobalamin taken up by hepatocytes is rapidly
(within an hour in the dog) re-excreted in bile
bound to haptocorrin.

Cobalamin of hepatobiliary origin, in common

Low serum cobalamin concentrations in dogs
have been associated with exocrine pancreatic
insufficiency (EPI), severe intestinal disease,
IF-Cbl receptor abnormalities, and conditions
associated with the proliferation of enteric
abacteria e.g stagnant loops.

Chronic diarrhea, weight loss and polyphagia
suggestive of maldigestion or malabsorption.
Elevated liver enzymes suggest a primary or secondary
hepatopathy in response to exogenous corticoteroids
or GI disease. Low cholesterol suggests small intestinal
disease, EPI or liver disease. Lack of other evidence
of hepatic synthetic failure (normal protein, BUN)
suggests low cholesterol may be due to GI disease
or EPI.
Normal TLI test lowers the likelihood of EPI
suggesting that high folate and low normal cobalamin
are due to intestinal disease. Due to the degree of
weight loss and lack of a definitive diagnosis an
exploratory laparotomy was performed to biopsy
the gastrointestinal tract, liver and mesenteric lymph
nodes.
At surgery a 10 cm tangled cloth in the stomach and
a 6cm cloth in the jejunum were found. These
were considered incidental as they were not causing
obstruction and likely secondary to the polyphagia.

Over the next two months the dog gained 10lbs (42# to 52#), fecal consistency normalized and
the energy level of the dog increased.

Commentary
The history of marked weight loss, diarrhea and polyphagia coupled with normal serum protein
but low cholesterol are typical for EPI. The increases in liver enzymes, particularly ALP are
higher than might be anticipated in EPI, but the prior steroid treatment and intestinal foreign
bodies may have contributed to these changes. The changes in cobalamin and folate are
suggestive of EPI or a blind loop syndrome.

No obstruction was visualized by ultrasound or at
surgery, so the changes in cobalamin and folate are likely
a consequence of EPI. However the TLI test result at
5.28 argued strongly against EPI. Usually dogs with
signs of EPI have TLI < 2.5. In this case histology
confirmed atrophy secondary to lymphocytic infiltration.
Perhaps the small amount of inflammation in the
residual pancreatic tissue was enough to keep
the TLI in the normal range while exocrine secretion
was severely impaired. Unfortunately the owner
declined further TLI tests to further investigate
the normal TLI.

- the regulation of small intestinal mucosal growth, enzyme synthesis and enzyme degradation
(Batt et al, 1979; Sorensen et al, 1988; Simpson et al, 1989b).
Trace element status in EPI has received relatively little study. One report of German Shepherd
dogs with EPI indicates normal serum concentrations of copper and zinc. However, it has been
recently demonstrated that serum copper and zinc decline, and serum iron and transferrin saturation increase, after pancreatic duct ligation (Adamama-Moraitou et al, 2001).
The clinical significance of these abnormalities is unclear. The severe malassimilation of nutrients
in EPI can lead to protein calorie malnutrition (Figure 8) that may further compromise residual
pancreatic function, intestinal absorption and metabolic homeostasis.

Pancreas

Dermatological abnormalities are variably present in German Shepherd dogs with EPI and their
presence may be related to protein calorie malnutrition, deficiencies in trace elements and minerals and potentially adverse reactions to food.

Treatment
> Enzyme supplement

A non-enteric enzyme preparation must be given at mealtimes in situations of insufficient enzyme secretion by the exocrine pancreas. Only powder enzyme preparations coated to resist the gastric acid should be administered. The alternative is feeding fresh pancreas.
Use only non-enteric coated powdered supplements that are in date and stored appropriately (dog:
0.25-0.4 g/kg body weight/meal or 2 tsp/20 kg body wt/meal) (Westermarck et al, 1987; Wiberg et
al, 1998). The enzyme supplement should be mixed into the food. Pre-incubation does not significantly impact outcome (Pidgeon & Strombeck, 1982). A new batch, change of preparation or
increased amounts may produce a response. If cessation of diarrhea and weight gain are observed
over a two week period the animal is maintained on this regimen and an attempt is made to decrease the enzyme supplement to the lowest effective dose.
If the therapy fails, the lot or the mode of presentation may be changed, or the enzyme quantities
increased. If a response is not being achieved with a dose of 0.4 g/kg of non-enteric coated powdered extract or 3g/kg body weight/meal whole pancreas, inadequate enzyme replacement is an
unlikely reason for treatment failure.
> Micronutrients

Fat soluble vitamins are likely candidates for malabsorption, and low levels of Vitamins A and E
have been reported in German Shepherd dogs with EPI. Vitamin E can be given orally (400500 IU SID q 1 month). It seems prudent to examine the vitamin K status of dogs with EPI who
have laboratory evidence of a coagulopathy.
Cobalamin deficiency can have a myriad of effects on the body and the provision of supplementary parenteral cobalamin (cyanocobalamin, Vitamin B12) is recommended because pancreatic
enzyme supplementation does not reverse the deficiency. Studies in dogs indicate that the parenteral administration of a single dose of cyanocobalamin (250-500 µg SQ once per month) is
enough to prevent recurrence of metabolic abnormalities for up to one month. The cobalamin
malabsorption does not resolve after enzyme supplementation and lifelong therapy is recommended.

Feeding dogs with EPI

A 50% reduction of the initial dose
is possible in the majority of the
dogs (Simpson et al, 1994). This
adaptation of the dose is important,
because the cost of pancreatic
enzymes is an obstacle to treatment
for many owners, who prefer to
euthanize their dogs.

The pivotal role of the exocrine pancreas in the digestion and assimilation of nutrients would suggest
that EPI is a disease that would be particularly amenable to nutritional intervention. In theory a highly digestible, fat restricted diet (fat is considered the most difficult nutrient to assimilate and lipase

activity is the limiting step in its digestion) that is low in fiber (fiber is indigestible, lowers energy density and hinders pancreatic enzyme activity) would seem justified in dogs with EPI. However, analysis
of the outcome (survival) of 116 dogs with EPI indicates that dogs that received a modified diet (n=73,
30% dead) did not outlive those receiving a standard diet (n=43, 35% dead) (Hall et al, 1991).
> Potential advantages of a high fat content

In complete contrast to the paradigm of fat restriction in EPI, diets with 43% calories from fat
have been shown to promote better protein, fat and carbohydrate digestibility compared to diets
containing 18 and 27% calories from fat in dogs with experimental EPI (Suzuki et al, 1999). Improved preservation of exogenous pancreatic enzymes, especially lipase, could explain this observation. It is of note that studies in dogs with experimental exocrine pancreatic insufficiency demonstrated that fecal fat output is more dependant on the digestibility of the fat, rather than the amount
fed (Pidgeon, 1982; Pidgeon & Strombeck, 1982).
A case report of 3 German Shepherd dogs with EPI and poor haircoat demonstrated that a 19%
fat DM (40.8 % of calories from fat), soy protein isolate hydrolysate and rice diet was well tolerated and improved fecal quality, haircoat and weight gain (2-10 kg) compared with the dogs
previous diets. The dogs recovered optimal body condition within a 2-month period (Biourge &
Fontaine, 2004).
These observations suggest that high fat, highly digestible diets are not contra-indicated in the
management of EPI. Traditionally, dietary supplementation with medium chain triglyceride oil (24 mL/meal) has been considered a beneficial way of providing calories to severely malnourished
patients fed a highly digestible fat restricted diet but supportive data are lacking. However feeding
a higher fat and thus more energy dense diet could promote a rapid restoration of optimal body
weight without recourse to medium chain triglyceride oil.
170

• Inadequate enzyme supplementation
This is probably the number one cause of treatment failure. Some dogs
develop an aversion to the enzyme supplement and raw pancreas may have
to be used, if attempts to disguise the powder are unsuccessful. Stomatitis
has been reported as a side effect of exogenous enzyme supplementation
and may be remedied by decreasing the supplement by 50% (Rutz et al,
2002). Decreasing the enzyme supplement may also be considered in the
majority of dogs with EPI.

• Bacterial overgrowth/intolerance

Finally, feeding a low fat (13% of calories) diet in combination
with exogenous enzymes (2.5 g/300 g food) to dogs (n=20)
has been shown to promote a 24% average weight gain over
a four month period, and a good response in 17/20 dogs
(Simpson et al, 1994). However, the role of the diet in
this study is unclear as 11/20 dogs were subsequently
successfully maintained on a variety of diets after
the trial period.

EPI may impact the quantity and composition of the small intestinal flora
and compromise the host response to a normal or abnormal flora. These
alterations are usually addressed by treatment with an enzyme supplement.
However, in some patients, diarrhea cannot be eliminated until antibiotics are administered. In these patients treatment failure may reflect decreased synthesis of intestinal mucosal enzymes associated with EPI. The presence of an abnormal flora cannot be predicted accurately by measuring serum concentrations of cobalamin and folate, so a trial with an antibiotic such as oxytetracycline (20 mg/kg PO TID 28d), or tylosin (10mg/kg PO TID) can be undertaken.

• Small intestinal disease
Routine hematology and biochemistry are almost always normal in uncomplicated EPI, so abnormalities such as hypoproteinemia (which may indicate a protein losing enteropathy) should be
pursued.

• Dietary modifications
Once these common reasons for treatment failure (inadequate enzyme supplementation, the presence of bacterial overgrowth or intolerance, and concomitant small intestinal disease) have been
addressed, nutritional modification must be considered.
Dietary management of small intestinal disease is typically based on feeding a highly digestible,
usually a rice based diet that is restricted in fat. If dietary sensitivity is suspected an antigen restricted or protein hydrolysate diet may be employed. Hydrolysates are produced by enzymatic proteolysis of native proteins which results in an array of peptides that are small enough so that they
may not be recognized by, nor trigger a reaction by the immune system (Guilford, 1996). These
peptides are also highly digestible, therefore reducing their retention time in the lumen of the
intestine. Soy hydrolysates have been used extensively in the prevention of food sensitivity in
babies and in calves (Lallès et al, 1995; Terracciano et al, 2002). If gastrointestinal signs resolve
after the dietary trial (usually one to two weeks) it is necessary to rechallenge the individual with
the original diet to confirm a diagnosis of dietary intolerance. The addition of specific antigens
such as beef, soy, chicken to the diet that induced remission is required to document hypersensitivity.

171

Pancreas

> Treatment failures

Benefits of dietary modification in dogs (n=14) fed a “moderate
fat, highly digestible low fiber diet” for four weeks versus a
maintenance diet were restricted to a tendency (8/14 dogs)
to reduced borborygmi, flatulence and fecal volume
(Westermarck et al, 1990). A study in 21 EPI dogs, evaluating
the benefit of feeding a low fat (13% of calories), low fiber diet
compared to the usual commercial or home cooked diet
failed to show any significant benefit of severe fat restriction
(Westermarck et al, 1995).

1 - Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency

As the importance of nutritional modification in the management of EPI
is far from clear, and the costs associated with special diets are a common
reason for euthanasia this author recommends initially feeding a good quality maintenance dog food (i.e. high digestibility) with an appropriate exogenous enzyme supplement mixed into it. If the response to treatment is
poor then dietary modification is an option (see treatment failure- below).

Conclusion/prognosis

If response to treatment is still poor then acid suppression to protect pancreatic enzymes and empirical dietary modifications can be made, while carefully reviewing the diagnosis of EPI and considering other underlying disorders.

Dogs with confirmed EPI that
respond poorly to appropriate
enzyme supplementation and
antimicrobial therapy usually require
investigation of the small intestine.

Conclusion/prognosis
In a majority of dogs suffering from EPI a high quality maintenance diet supplemented with powdered pancreatic enzymes resolves most of the abnormalities associated with the disease. The relatively high cost of enzyme supplementation and special diets can significantly impact the outcome, precipitating euthanasia. If pancreatitis or diabetes is associated, prognosis is more reserved.

It is of interest that the use of a soy hydrolysate diet with relatively high fat content was effective in facilitating weight gain, decreasing diarrhea and improving haircoat in three dogs with EPI
that had failed to respond to diet and pancreatic extracts (Biourge & Fontaine, 2004) (Figure 10).

A

The expense of pancreatic enzymes
makes it hard for me to justify
treating my dog. Is there any
way around this?

Enzyme costs can be reduced by feeding cow or pig pancreas (where available), this can be stored frozen in individual portions. A powdered pancreatic extract is usually recommended and
the dose of this may decrease with time, reducing cost.

Do I have to pre-incubate the food
with the pancreatic enzymes?

No. Sprinkle on the powder and mix it thoroughly. Pre-incubation is unnecessary.

Will my dog have to be on pancreatic enzyme supplementation for
life?

Usually this is the case. However, the amount of enzymes is often able to be reduced with time
and some reports suggest that occasional dogs may eventually be maintained enzyme free.

Can I breed my dog that has been
diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic
insufficiency?

Pancreatic acinar atrophy is a heritable condition in breeds such as German Shepherds and
Rough Coated Collies. It is therefore recommended not to breed dogs that have EPI, or come
from lines associated with EPI.

2 - Acute pancreatitis: diagnostic

Diagnostic reminder
A diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on a combination of compatible clinical, clinicopathological
and imaging findings. Surgical biopsy may be required to confirm a diagnosis, and to distinguish
inflammation from neoplasia.
> History

The history may reveal a recent episode of dietary indiscretion, toxin ingestion (e.g. chocolate or
high-fat food) or drug administration. Common clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, hunched
stance, vomiting (± blood), diarrhea (± blood), increased respiratory rate and enlarged abdomen.
Some dogs have a history of icterus preceded by vomiting.

2 - Acute pancreatitis

Polyuria and polydipsia may be present in dogs with diabetes mellitus and pancreatitis.
Dog suffering from acute pancreatitis.

> Physical examination

Physical findings in dogs with acute pancreatitis are very variable, ranging from depression, to mild
dehydration with signs of abdominal pain, to acute abdominal crisis, shock (tachycardia, prolonged capillary refill time, tacky mucous membranes, hypothermia), petechiation, icterus and ascites.
An abdominal mass is palpated in some dogs.
> Supplementary tests – clinicopathological findings

• Hematology
Extremely variable, ranging from mild neutrophilia and slightly increased hematocrit, through
marked leukocytosis with or without a left shift, to thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia
with a degenerative left shift. When thrombocytopenia is detected, tests of hemostasis (OSPT,
APTT, FDP or D-dimer, fibrinogen, antithrombin III) are performed to determine if the patient
has a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).

• Serum biochemistry
Serum biochemical abnormalities include azotemia (pre-renal and renal), increased liver enzymes
(ALT, AST, AP), hyperbilirubinemia, lipemia, hyperglycemia, hypoproteinemia, hypocalcemia,
metabolic acidosis and variable abnormalities (usually decreased) in sodium, potassium and chloride.

• Urinalysis
Urinalysis enables azotemia to be characterized as renal or pre-renal. Proteinuria occurs in some
dogs with acute pancreatitis, possibly as a consequence of pancreatic enzyme-mediated glomerular damage, and is usually transient. The presence of glucose or ketonuria should prompt consideration of diabetes mellitus.

• Pancreas specific enzymes
Classically, elevations in serum amylase and lipase activity have been used as indicators of pancreatic inflammation in dogs. However these enzymes can be increased in non-pancreatic disease, and dogs with confirmed pancreatitis may also have normal amylase and lipase activity. For
example, in dogs with histologically confirmed pancreatitis, lipase is normal in 28 to 61% of dogs,
and amylase is normal in 31 to 47% of dogs (Strombeck et al, 1981; Hess et al, 1998; Mansfield et
al, 2003). These limitations have led to the development of assays for enzymes or markers considered pancreatic in origin such as trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI), trypsinogen activation
peptide (TAP), and pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI). Experimental studies have documented high concentrations of TLI, TAP and PLI in dogs with experimental acute pancreatitis.

may be a better prognostic than diagnostic indicator of pancreatic inflammation (Mansfield & Jones,
2000; Mansfield et al, 2003).

Normal, subnormal and increased concentrations
of TLI have been observed in dogs with confirmed
pancreatitis and TLI level does not predict severity
(Ruaux & Atwell, 1999).

Experience with PLI is even more limited, though
it appears more promising than TLI as serum
elevations of PLI seem more substantial and
prolonged than TLI. Diseases such as renal disease
can increase TLI, TAP and PLI.

• Radiography
Radiographic findings in dogs with acute pancreatitis are generally non-specific and include loss
of serosal detail, increased opacity in the right cranial quadrant of the abdomen, displacement of
the duodenum ventrally and/or to the right, dilated hypomotile duodenum and caudal displacement of the transverse large intestine. Punctate calcification may occasionally be identified in
dogs with long-standing pancreatitis. It indicates saponification of mesenteric fat around the pancreas.
Ultrasonographic findings in a dog
Thoracic radiographs may enable the detection of pleural fluid, edema or pneumonia
which has been associated with pancreatitis in dogs.

• Ultrasonography

Ultrasonographic signs identical to those observed in the case of pancreatitis (Figure
11) may exist alongside other disorders such as pancreatic neoplasia, pancreatic edema
(associated with hypoproteinemia or portal hypertension) and enlarged peri-pancreatic structures (Lamb et al, 1995). Fine needle aspirates of cavitary lesions may be useful
to
distinguish abscess from pseudocyst.

One study of dogs with fatal acute pancreatitis indicated that ultrasound supported a
diagnosis of pancreatitis in 23/34 dogs (Hess et al,1998).

Figure 11A - English translation
The pancreas is diffusely enlarged with irregular
margins and mixed echogenicity. The mesenteric
fat in the right cranial abdomen is hyperechoic and

• Other imaging modalities
Contrast enhanced computed tomography is the imaging technique of choice in
people with pancreatitis and enables the distinction between pancreatic necrosis and
mild pancreatitis. It has only undergone preliminary evaluation in dogs (Jaeger et al,
2003).

• Abdominal paracentesis
© KW Simpson

Examination of peritoneal fluid may aid the detection of various causes of acute abdominal signs such as pancreatitis, gastrointestinal perforation or ruptured bile duct.

• Surgery
Surgical intervention can be undertaken in patients with persistent or recurrent pancreatitis to confirm the diagnosis and to detect neoplasia and complicating factors such
as infection. Surgery is also indicated to drain pancreatic abscesses and persistent pseudocysts (Salisbury et al, 1988). The advent of laparascopic techniques may decrease
morbidity (Harmoinen et al, 2002). Surgery is also indicated to place enteral feeding
tubes (see nutritional management below) and it is prudent to consider feeding tube
placement prior to an exploratory surgery in dogs with suspected pancreatitis.

Where abdominal pain is the major finding it is rapidly pursued with radiography, ultrasonography, and paracentesis, with supportive treatment provided on the basis of physical findings and
initial clinicopathological testing (Macintire,1988).
Diarrhea, that can be bloody, may also be observed in dogs with acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis and its complications (infection, pseudocyst or abscess formation) should be considered
in the differential diagnosis of icterus and pyrexia.
> Pitfalls and frequent mistakes

Pancreatitis is likely to be overdiagnosed when either clinical signs or clinicopathological tests are
used as the major/sole diagnostic criteria. Acute enteritis, intestinal obstruction and a variety of
causes of the acute abdomen can have very similar clinical and clinicopathological findings to
those of pancreatitis.
178

2 - Acute pancreatitis: epidemiology

Over-reliance on serum markers of pancreatic disease may lead to misdiagnosis. Increases in total
amylase and lipase are commonly encountered in a variety of other conditions, and normal values
do not exclude pancreatitis. More specific tests of pancreatic inflammation such as TLI, TAP and
PLI have not been thoroughly validated at this point so caution is advised when considering them.
Changes in pancreatic echogenicity and size have to be determined by a qualified sonographer,
and the sonographic findings integrated with other findings to determine if pancreatitis is a likely diagnosis. Pancreatitis has to be distinguished from neoplasia, or other causes of parenchymal
fluid accumulation such as portal hypertension, or hypoproteinemia.

Epidemiology
Pancreas

> Risk factors

Middle aged to old dogs (>5 years old) that are overweight appear at higher risk. There is no clear
sex predisposition. Dietary indiscretion, consumption of high fat meals, and the administration of
drugs (e.g. azathioprine, phenobarbital and potassium bromide) or toxins (e.g. organophosphates)
have been reported to precede the development of clinical signs suggestive of pancreatitis in dogs
(Simpson, 1993; Hess et al, 1999).
Endocrinopathies such as hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus and hyperadrenocorticism may also
be risk factors (Hess et al, 1999). Thirteen percent of 221 dogs with diabetes mellitus had histological evidence of acute pancreatitis. Hyperlipidemia is another potential risk factor (Hess et al,
2000).

• Breed predispositions
Miniature Schnauzers, Yorkshire and Silky Terriers and perhaps miniature Poodles may be at

Pathophysiological mechanisms
© Hermeline

The etiology and pathogenesis of spontaneous pancreatitis is poorly understood (Karne & Gorelick,1999; Zyromski & Murr, 2003). A wide variety of factors have been implicated by association
or experimentation as causes of acute pancreatitis in the dog. The potential causes of pancreatitis with a nutritional aspect are summarized in Figure 12.

2 - Acute pancreatitis: pathophysiology
Pancreas

Clinically, inflammation of the pancreas can be broadly categorized as acute, recurrent acute, or
chronic. Acute and recurrent acute pancreatitis are characterized by sudden episodes of inflammation and appear to be the most frequent form of pancreatitis in the dog.
• Acute pancreatitis may resolve or may cause continued inflammation (chronic or recurrent
acute) or necrosis which can be complicated by secondary infection and pseudocyst or abscess formation (Figures 13 & 14).
• Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by low grade or sub-clinical inflammation and may be a
factor in the development of diabetes mellitus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in dogs.

Figure 13 - Pancreatic abscess
Pancreatic abscess is a rare
complication of acute pancreatitis
in the dog. Treatment is
generally surgical.

Regardless of the initiating cause, pancreatitis is generally considered to occur when digestive
enzymes are activated prematurely within the pancreas. Experimental pancreatic hyperstimulation with cholecystokinin (CCK) or its analogue cerulein, dietary supplementation with ethionine, and obstruction of the pancreatic duct lead to the formation of large intracellular vacuoles in
acinar cells. Vacuole formation is thought to be a consequence of the uncoupling of exocytosis of
zymogens and abnormal intracellular trafficking of digestive and lysosomal enzymes. These subcellular alterations are considered to precipitate the intracellular activation of digestive enzymes.
Pancreatic hyperstimulation may be of direct relevance to naturally occurring pancreatitis in dogs.
CCK is normally released by cells in the duodenum in response to intraluminal fat and amino
acids and coordinates and stimulates pancreatic secretion and gallbladder contraction during
digestion. It is possible that high fat diets exert their effects via the excessive release of cholecystokinin and that hypercalcemia, organophosphates and high levels of circulating glucocorticoids
also facilitate (potentially by changing pancreatic sensitivity to hyperstimulation), or cause pancreatic hyperstimulation; however, this is not proven.

2 - Acute pancreatitis: pathophysiology

Edematous pancreatitis induced by CCK hyperstimulation in dogs is characterized by a rapid
but self-limiting, burst of trypsinogen activation (Figure 15), suggesting that the pancreas has
a feedback mechanism to limiting trypsinogen synthesis and activation (see nutritional management) (Simpson et al, 1995). This concept of pancreatic down regulation is important when
considering nutritional intervention in acute pancreatitis.

Edematous pancreatitis is generally regarded as the mildest form of pancreatitis (A). It is associated with self-limiting trypsinogen
activation and release of trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) into the circulation (B). In the clinical setting the accumulation of
fluid within the pancreas can be detected with ultrasound (C).

Release of active pancreatic enzymes and inflammatory mediators from the inflamed pancreas,
such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) interleukin-1 (IL-1) and platelet activating factor (PAF),
amplify the severity of pancreatic inflammation, and adversely affects the function of many organs
(systemic inflammatory response), and cause derangement in fluid, electrolyte and acid-base
balance (Denham & Norman, 1999; Ruaux et al, 1999; Brady & Otto, 2001; Mentula et al, 2004 ;
Raraty et al, 2004).

2 - Acute pancreatitis: nutritional management

Pancreas

It is the development of multisystemic abnormalities that separates mild from severe, potentially
fatal pancreatitis. Elucidating the systemic inflammatory response holds the promise of novel treatments for acute pancreatitis and is the focus of current research (Johnson et al, 2004; Oruc et al,
2004).

Nutritional management
> Identify and prevent, or treat,
nutritional factors associated with pancreatitis

Obesity, hyperlipidemia and dietary indiscretion are reported to be associated with pancreatitis in
dogs. Where these are present it would seem prudent to address their underlying cause in an
attempt to prevent future bouts of pancreatitis.
> Nutrient provision to dogs with pancreatitis

Precise recommendations for the dietary management of acute pancreatitis in dogs are hampered
by the absence of controlled studies, and are often based on empirical wisdom and a best guess
least harm approach.
> The dilemma between feeding and stimulating the pancreas

It has been well documented that pancreatic secretion in healthy dogs occurs in response to ingested nutrients, particularly fats and amino acids delivered into the duodenum (Figure 17).
Restricting oral intake, or providing nutrients intravenously, does not stimulate pancreatic secretion (Stabile et al, 1984). Thus it has been largely accepted that to provide “pancreatic rest” oral
intake should be withheld until clinical signs resolve, or when signs persist for approximately 7296 hrs that parenteral nutrition is introduced. This dogma is still prevalent in veterinary and
human medicine.

People with acute pancreatitis fed via jejunostomy tubes (these can be oral transpyloric tubes),
have lower morbidity, shorter hospital stays and less cost than those treated with TPN (Figure
17) (Kalfarentzos et al, 1997; McClave et al, 1997; Windsor et al, 1998; Powell et al, 2000; Pupelis
et al, 2000; Paraskeva et al, 2001; Duerksen et al, 2002).
Since it is now technically possible to place jejunostomy tubes non-surgically in dogs, through the
nose, esophagus or stomach, clinical application of this feeding strategy is not restricted by a surgical procedure. However, it remains open to question whether patients with acute pancreatitis
really require jejunal delivery of nutrients. There is evidence that the pancreas of dogs with acute
experimental pancreatitis (see CCK induced pancreatitis above), and people with naturally occurring severe pancreatitis, is not as amenable to stimulation as the normal pancreas. Dogs recovering from naturally occurring pancreatitis have also been shown to have subnormal circulating
TLI concentrations suggesting that pancreatic enzyme synthesis is downregulated. In addition, it
appears that the major benefits of enteral support in acute pancreatitis in people and experimental dogs are due to reductions in the systemic inflammatory response and the translocation of enteric bacteria rather than a reduction in pancreatic stimulation. In this respect probiotic treatment
may have a role, and it has been evaluated in people (Olah et al, 2002).
Intestinal permeability and morbidity in dogs with parvovirus are positively impacted by feeding
a liquid diet (41% protein, 18% fat, 3% crude fiber) through a nasoesophageal tube supporting
the concept that enteral feeding in general, rather than jejunal delivery, is the reason for the beneficial effects of enteral nutrition, though this needs to be critically evaluated (Mohr et al, 2003).
Despite the evidence from human clinical trials and experimental studies in dogs, resistance to
enteral feeding of dogs with pancreatitis is anticipated. One common argument used to promote
parenteral nutrition in dogs with pancreatitis is that they vomit too frequently to be fed enterally. However, recent studies in dogs with parvovirus should also help to allay this fear as these dogs
tolerated naso-esophageal feeding despite severe vomiting and diarrhea, with enterally fed dogs
showing faster recovery rates, greater body weight gains and lower intestinal permeability than
dogs that were held nil per os (Mohr et al, 2003).
It is not intended that parenteral nutrition be discontinued completely, but that its use be restricted to patients that really need it, for instance those in whom caloric intake is severely and
persistently impaired by persistent vomiting. When parenteral nutrition is indicated a choice has
to be made between total and partial parenteral nutrition. Partial parenteral nutrition (PPN) is a
more practical and manageable procedure than TPN in most settings and has been shown to be
a safe and effective way of providing nutrition to dogs with pancreatitis and gastrointestinal disease (Chan et al, 2002). Interestingly dogs that received a combination of enteral and partial parenteral nutrition survived more often than those receiving partial parenteral nutrition exclusively
(Chan et al 2002).

2 - Acute pancreatitis: nutritional management

However, there is growing evidence in people and animals that enteral nutrition is superior to
parenteral nutrition in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. It has been shown in both people and
animals that jejunal feeding (distal to the site of pancreatic stimulation) does not exacerbate acute
pancreatitis (Vu et al, 1999; Qin et al, 2002, 2003).

Commentary

No evidence of metabolic or endocrine
causes of vomiting, no history of access to
drugs or toxins. Static gas filled duodenum
on radiographs suggests ileus secondary to
intestinal disease, pancreatitis or peritonitis.
Ultrasound showed no abnormalities apart
from an enlarged hypoechoic pancreas.
The laboratory tests showed hemoconcentration
(increased PCV, and pre-renal azotemia),
neutrophilia and a left shift, mild
hypoalbuminemia, elevated liver enzymes,
hypercholesterolemia, lipemic serum and
increased fibrinogen. Taken as a whole
these findings are consistent with a diagnosis
of acute pancreatitis.

A working diagnosis of pancreatitis was
established. The absence of thrombocytopenia
or coagulation changes argues against
pancreatic necrosis. Treatment continues with
crystalloids at twice maintenance fluid rate and
an infusion of 10ml/kg of hetastarch. Heparin
(100 u/kg SC) was given to clear the lipemia.
Buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg SC q 8hrs) was
administered for abdominal pain. Ampicillin
(20 mg/kg IV TID) was initiated because
of the left shift. The dog is maintained NPO
for 48 hrs. Vital signs, PCV and protein,
electrolytes, platelet count, and body weight
are monitored.

This dog has fairly classical findings associated
with acute pancreatitis. The relatively rapid
response to treatment along with absence of
coagulation abnormalities is consistent with
mild, rather than necrotizing, pancreatitis.
The dietary management of this case is
the conventional normal. Given recent
observations in experimental dogs and people,
enteral feeding could have been started through
a nasogastric or nasojejunal feeding tube,
however, the merits of this approach in clinical
patients remains to be determined.

Vomiting and abdominal pain resolve on the
third day and chicken broth is fed. The patient
continues to improve and is weaned onto, and
discharged on a fat restricted diet (due to
hyperlipidemia).

If the patient had presented with evidence
of more severe pancreatitis or had not
responded so rapidly to treatment a more
aggressive therapeutic and nutritional
plan would have been initiated, such
as a plasma transfusion and surgical
placement of a jejunostomy tube.

Frequently asked questions

> What diet should be fed to dogs recovering
from pancreatitis?

Free choice oral feeding is usually resumed when the appetite returns and vomiting and abdominal pain have subsided. Fat is frequently regarded as the major nutrient to be restricted as it stimulates CCK release and pancreatic secretion. However amino acids are also potent stimulators
of pancreatic enzyme secretion and they are not restricted.

Pancreas

High-fat diets (>50 g/1000 kcal) with low protein contents (<20 g/1000 kcal) that have a nutrient
profile similar to diet known to induce pancreatitis in dogs must be avoided. Obesity, a risk factor for pancreatitis, should be controlled with a balanced nutritional approach. Elemental diets
cause a similar degree of pancreatic stimulation as normal diets.

The composition of a home-made diet must be adapted to the characteristics of the pancreatic disease.

• Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency:
Choose highly digestible ingredients. The ideal fat content can vary with individual cases:
- poor body condition: a diet designed for cachectic animals is suitable (see chapter 13)
- fat intolerance: a low fat-diet, suitable for hyperlipidemia is advised (see chapter 7)
A hypoallergenic diet can be the second choice if the animal doesn't respond or if a dietary allergy is
suspected (see Chapter 2).

• Acute pancreatitis:
Choose a low fat-diet, suitable for hyperlipidemia (see Chapter 7).

Frequently asked questions: pancreatitis

Q

A

My dog has just recovered from
pancreatitis. Is there anything I
can do to avoid the dog getting
pancreatitis again?

There is no simple answer to this question. Where risk factors can be eliminated the chance of
recurrence is likely to be reduced. For example avoidance of dietary indiscretion or drugs (e.g phenobarbital and potassium bromide) that were thought to precipitate the bout may decrease the
chance of recurrence. Where hyperlipidemia is present feeding a fat restricted diet and maintaining
optimal body weight may decrease the chance of recurrence.

My dog was diagnosed with
pancreatitis a week ago. He has
now stopped vomiting but he is
now turning yellow. Why is this
happening?

The development of jaundice after acute pancreatitis is usually associated with obstruction of the
bile duct by pancreatic inflammation. The diagnosis is usually made with a combination of blood
tests and abdominal ultrasonography. Where the dog is otherwise happy and healthy conservative
management consists of monitoring physical and biochemical parameters for approximately two
weeks to see if hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice are resolving or worsening. When biliary obstruction persists for over two to three weeks it is usually relieved surgically.

Pancreas

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency affects all breeds of dog, but the syndrome
is particularly common in German Shepherds and Collies around
2 years of age.

Key Points
to remember:

The role of nutrition in the treatment
of pancreatic disorders
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency syndrome (EPI) results not only from the
reduced digestion of nutrients in the
intestinal lumen, but also from insufficient neutralization of chyme, an
alteration of enzymes of the brush
border and the proliferation of intestinal bacteria. This results in abnormal activity of intestinal mucosal
enzymes as well as a reduction in the
transportation of sugars, amino
acids, fatty acids and vitamins (particularly vitamin B12) from the intestinal lumen to the enterocytes.

188

The treatment of EPI consists supplementing meals with pancreatic
enzymes and feeding these animals
a highly digestible diet.
The most effective ways of administering enzyme supplements are:
- pancreatic powder: 3 g per meal for
a 20-35-kg dog
- fresh pig or bovine pancreas: 50100 g per meal for a medium dog.
Tablets should be avoided as they are
often found intact in fecal matter.

Preincubation of the meal with the
enzymes serves no purpose. The initial dose can most often be reduced
to 50% as soon as the animal
responds to treatment. This procedure is not insignificant given the cost
of the enzyme supplements.
Supplementation will be life-long for
most dogs.
Oral bleeding has been reported in
dogs receiving pancreatic enzyme
supplements. A 50% reduction in the
supplement generally eliminates the
clinical signs.

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

The Traditional Approach
Traditionally, a highly-digestible lowfiber diet with a moderate fat
content is generally recommended
for the nutritional management of
patients with EPI.
- The low fiber content is dictated by
the need to safeguard an energyconcentrated diet (for dogs with
pancreatic insufficiency that are difficult to keep in good condition). In
addition, excess fiber can inhibit
the action of the pancreatic
enzymes.
- Fat restriction in EPI is recommended
to prevent diarrhea which is stimulated by the presence of hydroxylated
fatty acids in the intestinal lumen,
which stimulates water loss. These
hydroxylated fatty acids are produced by the intestinal flora, which proliferate as a result of the influx of
non-digested fats in the intestine.
The malabsorption of fat, is due to
both the pancreatic lipase deficiency
and to deconjugation of biliary acids
by bacterial.

The interest
of fat

If no improvement (weight gain,
reduction in diarrhea or polyphagia)
is observed within 4-5 days following
the start of enzyme or dietetic treatment, an antibiotic treatment should
be initiated (metronidazole or tylosin) to combat bacterial proliferation.

Selecting a highly
digestible source of starch

Conclusion
Contrary to conventional wisdom,
some dogs with EPI can tolerate
large quantity of fat in their diet.
The dietary fat permits better
conservation of the enzyme supplementation while it passes through
the acid environment of the stomach. Protein hydrolysate-based diets
will benefit not only the digestive
function but also dietary intolerance.

Its very high starch digestibility
makes rice the preferred cereal for
dogs with EPI, who may also suffer
from allergies and dietary intolerances. Preliminary observations
appear to indicate that a protein
hydrolysate diet can have a very
favorable effect in dogs with EPI. The
small peptides in these diets facilitate digestion and absorption.

Preventing
vitamin deficiencies
Vitamin B12 and vitamin E deficiencies are very common in dogs suffering from EPI. Vitamin A and K deficiencies have also been identified.
Parenteral supplementation is necessary to correct these deficiencies.

Prognosis
The quality of life for the majority of
dogs suffering from EPI that receive
enzyme supplements and are fed
twice a day is very similar to that of
healthy individuals. The prognosis
for dogs with EPI associated with
pancreatitis or diabetes is more
reserved.
© Lenfant

However, studies have contradicted
this practice. A high-fat diet (43%
calories) improves fat absorption
(and the clinical signs) in dogs with
EPI compared with a standard maintenance diet (27% fat calories) or a
low-fat diet (16% calories).

Hypothesis: a high-fat diet will result
in a better conservation of lipase in
the pancreatic supplement. Highly
digestible diets that contain approx.
20% fat are very well tolerated by
dogs with EPI. High-fat diets also
favor energy consumption in underweight animals.

In German Shepherds
the transmission of endocrine
pancreatic insufficiency
suggests a recessive autosomal
gene trait.

Interest of a high-fat

Dermatological signs of adverse
reaction to food are common in dogs
suffering from EPI, especially in
German Shepherd Dogs. Dogs with
these two diseases respond poorly to
enzyme supplementation and a diet
specifically designed for EPI.
The report below describes the positive responses of 4 German Shepherd

Four male German Shepherd dogs,
age range 2.5-9.0 yrs, body weight
31-40 kg, and suffering from EPI (TLI
0.88 to 5.08 µg/L) were included in
this study.

All dogs were suffering from recurrent diarrhea that was more or less

Only the fourth dog still had average
pruritus and some erythamtous
lesions and local scabbing associated

A high level of fat (40.8 % of the

the dogs of this study and confirms
earlier findings. This suggests that
high fat and highly digestible diets
not only are not contra-indicated in
the management of EPI but could be
beneficial to restore body condition.

After 7 days’ exclusive consumption
of the food described above, feces

SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE HYDROLYSATE
- non-digestible carbohydrates that
are likely to ferment in the colon
and to induce flatulence and other
digestive disturbances.

- anti-nutritional factors (e.g. antitrypsin) that inhibit protein digestion and proper absorption of
nutrients

Soy hydrolysate is obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of soy isolate.
Compared with intact proteins forming soy isolate, the hydrolysate
contains
smaller
polypeptides.

During the process of obtaining soy
protein isolate hydrolysate, the
undesirable substances are destroyed or removed. Its main advantages are:
- very high digestibility and excellent
digestive tolerance
- reduced ability to induce allergic
reactions.

iabetes mellitus is a common endocrine disease of dogs and
requires life-long therapy. Nutritional management is an
important part of the treatment regimen and feeding guidelines
based on evidence from well-designed clinical studies are
essential. The first part of this chapter provides an understanding
of the pathogenesis of diabetes in dogs, which is required before
evaluation of issues relating to nutritional management. This
allows comparison of the current, evidence-based, nutritional
recommendations for human patients with types of diabetes
analogous to canine diabetes. The second part reviews the
available evidence from feeding studies in dogs and provides
detailed analysis of the recommendations for dietary fiber,
carbohydrate, fat, protein, and selected micronutrients in
diabetic dogs. The final summary uses the American Diabetes
Association grading system to rank the scientific basis of the
nutritional recommendations for canine diabetes.

Prevalence of diabetes mellitus in dogs
Diabetes mellitus is one of the most frequent endocrine diseases affecting middle-aged and older
dogs, and the prevalence is increasing. Thirty years ago, 19 in 10,000 dogs visiting veterinary hospitals were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Marmor et al, 1982; Guptill et al, 2003). By 1999, the
prevalence in the same veterinary hospitals had increased three-fold to 58 per 10,000 dogs (Figure
1) (Guptill et al, 2003).

Prevalence of DM increased over the study period. The number of institutions for which data are
recorded is lower from 1995 to 1999 (16 institutions in 1994, 13 in 1995, 12 each in 1996-1997,
11 each in 1998-1999), therefore the number of cases per year is lower in these years.

Clinical sequelae of diabetes in dogs
Insulin deficiency results in altered carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. Abnormal carbohydrate metabolism manifests as hyperglycemia and glycosuria and is responsible for the polyuria,
polydipsia, and cataract formation seen in diabetic dogs. The hyperlipidemia, ketone production,
and hepatic changes seen in these dogs primarily results from altered fat metabolism. Decreased
tissue utilization of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids causes lethargy, weight loss, reduced stimulation of the satiety center, poor coat, and reduced immunity that is characteristic of untreated diabetic dogs.

b: Severe uveitis in a diabetic
dog. The eye is red and painful,

ocular discharge and posterior

> Cataract formation

Cataract formation is the most common, and one of the most important, long-term complications
associated with diabetes in dogs (Beam et al, 1999) (Figure 2). Cataracts are irreversible and can
progress quite rapidly (Figure 3). About 30% of diabetic dogs already have reduced vision at presentation (Graham & Nash, 1997a). Cataracts will develop within 5-6 months of diagnosis in the
majority of diabetic dogs and, by 16 months, approximately 80% will have significant cataract formation (Beam et al, 1999). Importantly, the risk of cataract development seems to be unrelated to
the level of hyperglycemia but increases with age (Salgado et al, 2000). Thus, dietary manipulation
is not likely to influence the rate or severity of cataract development in diabetic dogs.

> Concurrent disease

Treated diabetic dogs have a similar chance
of survival as compared to non-diabetic dogs
of the same age and gender, although the
hazard of death occurring is greatest during
the first 6 months of therapy (Graham &
Nash, 1997b). Most diabetic dogs are middleaged and older and are prone to diseases that
commonly affect this age group. Consequently, many suffer concurrent problems
that need to be managed in combination
with the diabetes. For diabetic dogs receiving
insulin therapy, the nutritional requirements
of any concurrent disease may need to take
precedence over the dietary therapy for diabetes. Regardless of the diet fed, glycemic
control can still usually be maintained with
exogenous insulin therapy.

c: The same dog following phacoemulsification
surgery to remove the cataract from the right
eye.

If concurrent illness causes transient inappetence, it is generally advisable to administer
half the usual insulin dose to reduce the risk
of hypoglycemia. Diabetic dogs with a reduced appetite will often eat if they are hand-fed highly palatable food by their owner. If there is a
more severe concurrent illness causing prolonged inappetence, diabetic dogs should be hospitalized for blood glucose concentration monitoring and treatment with a rapid-acting insulin preparation and intravenous fluids supplemented with glucose and potassium (Feldman et al, 2004a).

Insulin-induced hypoglycemia
Severe hypoglycemia resulting from insulin overdose can cause irreversible brain damage and
death, and avoidance of insulin-induced hypoglycemia is one of the primary aims of therapy in
diabetic dogs. Dietary manipulation that reduces the risk of insulin-induced hypoglycemia affords
important clinical benefit for diabetic dogs. Severe hypoglycemia has been reported in a diabetic
dog that was fed ad libitum and received insulin at grossly irregular intervals (Whitley et al, 1997).
Commercial dog foods usually result in postprandial elevation of plasma glucose for less than 90
minutes following consumption by dogs (Nguyen et al, 1998a) and meals should ideally be timed
so that maximal exogenous insulin activity occurs during the postprandial period (Church, 1982).
Thus, dogs should be fed within 2 hours of administration of lente insulin or within 6 hours of
protamine zinc insulin (Stenner et al, 2004) (Figure 4). In practice, a feasible compromise is to feed
the dog immediately following the insulin injection. This considerably simplifies the home treatment regimen for most dog owners while still allowing good glycemic control to be readily achieved. In addition, many owners prefer this regimen because they feel their pet is rewarded for submitting to the injection.
Because the daily insulin-dosing regimen tends to be fixed for diabetic dogs, it is important that a
predictable glycemic response is achieved following each meal. Ideally, every meal should contain
the same ingredients and calorie content, and should be fed at the same time each day. It is crucial that the diet fed is palatable so that food intake is predictable. The major determinant of the
postprandial glycemic response in dogs is the starch content of the meal (Nguyen et al, 1998b) so
particular care should be applied to ensure consistent source and content of dietary starch.
The importance of avoiding an insulin overdose cannot be over-emphasized. Every person in the
diabetic dog’s household needs to be aware of this life-threatening complication, which can rapid194

For insulin-treated diabetic dogs, meals should ideally be timed so that maximal exogenous insulin activity occurs during the
postprandial period. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of two commercial veterinary insulin preparations, lente
(Caninsulin®, Intervet) and protamine zinc insulin (PZI VET®, IDEXX), indicate that the maximal glucose-lowering effect
occurs during the first 2 hours following subcutaneous administration for lente insulin, and within 6 hours of subcutaneous
protamine zinc insulin injection. Commercial dog foods usually result in postprandial elevation of plasma glucose for less than
90 minutes following consumption, thus dogs should be fed within 30 minutes of administration of lente insulin or within 4.5 hours
of protamine zinc insulin. A feasible compromise is to feed the dog immediately following the insulin injection. This considerably
simplifies the home treatment regimen for most dog owners while still allowing good glycemic control to be readily achieved.

ly develop into a serious emergency. If some insulin is spilt during the injection it should never be
‘topped up’, even if it appears that the dog has received no insulin. If the owner is ever uncertain
about whether or not to give an insulin dose, the safest option is to withhold the injection, as the
consequences of missing a single insulin dose are negligible. If mild signs of hypoglycemia develop, the owner should feed a meal of the dog’s usual food. If the dog is unwilling or unable to eat,
syrup containing a high glucose concentration can be administered orally. Suitable syrups are marketed for use by human diabetics. When the dog recovers, food should be fed as soon as possible.
No more insulin should be given to the dog and the owner should discuss the case with a veterinarian before the next injection is due. A 50% reduction in insulin dose is usually recommended
in these circumstances.
Successful management of 94% of diabetic dogs is achieved with twice-daily insulin dosing (Hess
& Ward, 2000). High doses of insulin and episodes of hypoglycemia are more common in diabetic dogs that receive insulin only once-daily (Hess & Ward, 2000). Although treatment regimens

Diabetes

comprising once-daily insulin injections are considered by some to be simpler and more convenient, most of these regimens involve feeding two meals each day, one soon after the insulin injection and another at the time of peak insulin activity about 8 hours later. Given the length of the
usual working day, it may actually be more convenient for people to feed the second meal 12 hours
after the first. Experienced owners rarely report any difficulty with the administration of insulin
injections and, if they are required to be at home to feed the dog, it is little more effort to give the
dog an insulin injection at the same time. As a result, many clinicians favor treatment regimens
that involve administration of the same dose of insulin along with feeding of the same sized meal
every 12 hours.

Pathogenesis of diabetes in dogs
The owners of diabetic dogs
should be aware that a consistent
insulin-dosing and feeding routine
is optimal. Conservative, fixed-dose,
twice-daily insulin therapy, in
conjunction with a palatable diet
containing a consistent content and
source of dietary starch, which is
fed at defined times in relation to
insulin administration, is likely to be
associated with reduced risk of
hypoglycemia in diabetic dogs.

Evidence is mounting for a genetic
basis for canine diabetes. An association with major histocompatibility
complex alleles on the dog leukocyte
antigen gene strongly suggests that
the immune response has a role in
the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus
(Kennedy et al, 2003; Davison et al,
2003a; Rand et al, 2004).

196

The current classification of human diabetes mellitus is based on pathogenesis, and thus provides
a rational foundation for understanding treatment issues. Adoption of these criteria for canine diabetes will afford a similar benefit for veterinarians. Human diabetes is divided into type 1, type 2,
other specific types of diabetes, and gestational diabetes (The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and
Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 1997). At present, there are no internationally accepted criteria
for the classification of canine diabetes. If the criteria established for human diabetes were applied
to dogs, at least 50% of diabetic dogs would be classified as type 1. The remainder are likely to
have ‘other specific types of diabetes’ resulting from pancreatic destruction or chronic insulin resistance, or they have diestrus-induced diabetes.
> Type 1 diabetes

Type 1 diabetes appears to be the most common form of diabetes in dogs, and is characterized by
pancreatic beta cell destruction leading to absolute insulin deficiency. In people, this usually occurs
via cell-mediated, autoimmune processes and is associated with multiple genetic predispositions
and poorly defined environmental factors (The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of
Diabetes Mellitus, 1997). The majority of diabetic dogs have absolute insulin deficiency (Montgomery et al, 1996). The etiology of beta cell destruction is often unknown, although there is evidence that in approximately 50% of diabetic dogs it is caused by immune-mediated processes similar to human type 1 diabetes (Alejandro et al, 1988; Hoenig & Dawe; 1992; Davison et al, 2003a,
2003b).
Although genetic susceptibility appears to be a prerequisite, multiple environmental factors likely initiate beta cell autoimmunity, which once begun, then proceed by common pathogenic pathways (Kukreja & Maclaren, 1999). Similar to canine diabetes, the incidence rate of type 1 diabetes
in people is rising (Onkamo et al, 1999), a trend that has been explained on the basis of increased
contacts with adverse environmental factors (Kukreja & Maclaren, 1999). There is a highly significant seasonal incidence of diagnosis of both human type 1 diabetes (Gamble & Taylor, 1969; Fleegler et al, 1979) and canine diabetes (Atkins & MacDonald, 1987), with the incidence peaking in

1 - Diabetes in dogs

winter, indicating that environmental influences may have a role in disease progression just prior
to diagnosis.
The rate of progression to absolute insulin deficiency is quite variable in human patients. It can
be rapid in young children and much slower in middle-aged and older people. This latter group
has the latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) form of type 1 diabetes, which is characterized by gradual beta cell destruction over months or years and is not associated with obesity
(Zimmet et al, 1994). Distinct autoantibody patterns are recognized in the acute onset and slowly
progressive (LADA) forms of human type 1 diabetes (Zimmet et al, 1994; Seissler et al, 1998), indicating a different pathogenesis for the two forms of the disease.

Diabetes

The rate of progression to absolute insulin deficiency has not been studied in dogs, but epidemiological factors closely match those of human patients with the LADA form of type 1 diabetes,
who are usually not obese and tend to be middle-aged and older. Most affected dogs are over 7
years of age and the onset of clinical signs is typically insidious, ranging from weeks to months in
duration (Ling et al, 1977). This has prompted speculation that there may also be similarities between the pathogenesis of canine diabetes and human LADA.
> Other types of canine diabetes

• Association between diabetes and pancreatitis in dogs
Extensive pancreatic damage, which likely results from chronic pancreatitis, is responsible for the
development of diabetes in approximately 28% of diabetic dogs (Alejandro et al, 1988) and thus is
the most common ‘other specific type’ of diabetes in dogs. Beta cell loss is being investigated in
non-diabetic dogs with chronic pancreatitis and preliminary findings indicate that some have
reduced beta cell function and appear to be pre-diabetic (Watson & Herrtage, 2004). Serum canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI) is a sensitive marker for pancreatic inflammation in
dogs (Steiner, 2003). Increases in serum cPLI concentration have been reported in 5 of 30 (17%)
newly diagnosed diabetic dogs, although none of these dogs had serum cPLI concentrations above
the diagnostic cut-off value for pancreatitis (Davison et al, 2003b).

The association between canine diabetes and pancreatitis warrants particular attention because
beta cell autoimmunity, pancreatic inflammation, and regulation of gut immunity might be linked in disease pathogenesis. The gut immune system likely plays a central role in the pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes because accumulating evidence suggests that affected persons have
aberrant regulation of gut immunity (Vaarala, 1999, Akerblom et al, 2002). The gut and the pancreas are probably immunologically linked, as well as anatomically linked, and influenced by environmental factors such as intestinal microflora, infections, and dietary factors (Vaarala, 1999).
Hypertriglyceridemia has been proposed as a possible inciting cause of canine pancreatitis
(Williams, 1994) and is commonly seen in diabetic dogs (Ling et al, 1977). Obesity affects onequarter to one-third of dogs presented to veterinary practices (Edney & Smith, 1986), and is also
associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis (Hess et al, 1999). Environmental factors such as
feeding high-fat diets, lipemia and disturbances in lipid metabolism, have been implicated as
potential etiological factors in dogs with obesity-associated pancreatitis (Simpson, 1993), and
likely play a role in the development of pancreatitis in diabetic dogs. More detailed discussion on
canine pancreatitis and hyperlipidemia can be found in chapters 5 and 7 of this encyclopedia.

In long-term diabetic dogs with no clinical evidence of exocrine pancreatic disease, serum cPLI
concentrations in the diagnostic range for pancreatitis were found in 2 of 12 (17%) dogs, with a
further 4 (33%) dogs recording increases in cPLI that did not reach the diagnostic cut-off value
for pancreatitis, and an additional 2 (17%) dogs having laboratory evidence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (unpublished data). This indicates that subclinical exocrine pancreatic disease is
common in diabetic dogs.

1 - Diabetes in dogs

• Role of insulin resistance in canine diabetes
Diabetes induced by insulin resistance states are less common ‘other specific types’ of canine diabetes.
Disease conditions such as hyperadrenocorticism (Peterson, 1984) and acromegaly (Selman et al,
1994) result in insulin resistance, and may induce diabetes in dogs. Iatrogenic causes of insulin
resistance that might lead to induced diabetes include chronic corticosteroid therapy (Campbell &
Latimer, 1984). As most dogs do not develop overt diabetes with chronic corticosteroid therapy or
spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism, for overt diabetes to develop it might require underlying reduced beta cell function resulting from immunological processes or chronic pancreatitis.

Diabetes

Although obesity causes insulin resistance in dogs, there are no published data clearly indicating
that obesity is a risk factor for canine diabetes.
Obesity is a well-established risk factor for type 2 diabetes in cats and people. In contrast, there
are no well-documented studies demonstrating convincingly that type 2 diabetes is a significant
disease entity in dogs. In dogs, obesity causes insulin resistance (Rocchini et al, 1999; Villa et al, 1999,
Mittelman et al, 2002), which leads to hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance (Mattheeuws
et al, 1984, Henegar et al, 2001). These effects are particularly pronounced when obesity is induced
by feeding a diet high in saturated fat (Truett et al, 1998). Dogs fed a high-fat diet develop insulin
resistance that is not compensated for by increased insulin secretion, resulting in more severe glucose intolerance (Kaiyala et al, 1999). Despite the evidence that obesity causes impaired glucose
tolerance, it appears that very few dogs develop overt diabetes as a consequence of obesity-induced insulin resistance.
Diestrus- and gestation-associated diabetes

Gestational diabetes is another classification of diabetes recognized in human patients. In women,
it is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy
(The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 1997). If overt diabetes
persists after the pregnancy ends, then it is reclassified as type 1, type 2,
or another specific type of diabetes. Reduced insulin sensitivity occurs in
healthy bitches by day 30-35 of gestation (McCann, 1983) and becomes
more severe during late pregnancy (Concannon, 1986). The luteal phase
of the non-pregnant cycle of the bitch is similar in duration to the 9
weeks of pregnancy and it is generally agreed that the hormone profiles
during diestrus and pregnancy, are essentially identical (Concannon et al,
1989; Feldman et al, 2004b). Progesterone elevation causes glucose intolerance and overt diabetes during diestrus in bitches (Eigenmann et al,
1983, Scaramal et al, 1997). Progesterone also stimulates the mammary
gland of bitches to produce growth hormone, which is a potent inducer
of insulin resistance (Selman et al, 1994).

© Lanceau

The periodic influence of diestrus-associated insulin resistance might
contribute to the increased risk of female compared with male dogs for
developing diabetes (Marmor et al, 1982; Guptill et al, 2003).
If diabetes is diagnosed in a bitch during either
pregnancy or diestrus, it probably should be classified as
being comparable to human gestational diabetes. If diabetes
persists after pregnancy or diestrus ends, then it should
be reclassified as type 1 or another
specific type of diabetes.

Nutritional perspectives based on pathogenesis
of diabetes in dogs
Understanding the pathogenesis of diabetes in dogs provides a logical foundation for understanding issues relating to nutritional management of this disease. Recently, the American Diabetes
Association released a position statement comprising a large meta-analysis presenting evidencebased nutrition principles and recommendations for the treatment and prevention of human diabetes (Franz et al, 2002a). Consideration of the evidence-based recommendations for human
patients with types of diabetes comparable to canine diabetes provides a rational perspective for
dietary recommendations for diabetic dogs.
> Dietary carbohydrate and type 1 diabetes

Diabetes

Perspective gained from the dietary carbohydrate recommendations for human type 1 diabetics
provide relevant perspective for canine diabetics because at least 50% of diabetic dogs appear to
have analogous disease. Most relevant is perhaps the current recommendation regarding consumption of dietary fiber by human type 1 diabetics. After decades spent researching the effects of dietary fiber on the glycemic and lipemic responses of diabetic people, it is interesting that the current recommendation is that consumption of fiber is to be encouraged in all people and that those
with type 1 diabetes require no more dietary fiber than non-diabetic people (Franz et al, 2002a).
This suggests that there might also be no clinical benefit of feeding a diet with increased levels of
fiber to diabetic dogs compared with feeding ‘typical’, moderate-fiber diets formulated for adult
maintenance.
With regard to the glycemic effects of carbohydrates, there is strong evidence in human diabetics
that the total amount of carbohydrate in meals and snacks is more important than the source or
type (Franz et al, 2002a). Additionally, there is a strong association between the pre-meal insulin
dosage required and the postprandial glycemic response to the carbohydrate content of the meal,
regardless of the glycemic index, fiber, fat, or caloric content of the meal (Franz et al, 2002a). As
a regimen of fixed daily insulin dosages is typically used to manage diabetic dogs, it is rational to
provide a consistent amount of carbohydrate in the meals fed each day.

The primary goal regarding dietary fat in human patients with diabetes is to decrease intake of saturated fat and cholesterol to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (Franz et al, 2002a). As coronary heart disease is not recognized as a significant clinical entity in dogs, it might not be relevant
to extrapolate dietary fat recommendations for human patients to diabetic dogs. For most human
type 1 diabetics, effective insulin therapy returns serum lipid levels to normal and usually lowers
plasma triglyceride concentrations (Franz et al, 2002a). However, for obese individuals with type 1
diabetes, there is strong evidence that restricted intake of saturated fats, incorporation of monounsaturated fats into the diet, modest weight loss, and increased physical activity may be beneficial
(Franz et al, 2002a). The same recommendations might afford clinical benefit for obese diabetic dogs.
> Dietary protein and type 1 diabetes

The protein composition of the recommended diet for people with diabetes is the same as that
recommended for the non-diabetic population (Franz et al, 2002a). However, if microalbuminuria
or persistent proteinuria develop, then protein restriction might help slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in these people (EASD, 1995).

> Diabetes with exocrine pancreatic disease

Approximately 60% of human type 1 diabetics have reduced exocrine pancreatic function and it
is now recognized that diabetes secondary to exocrine pancreatic disease might be more frequent
in people than previously realized (Hardt et al, 2000). Despite this, no specific dietary recommendations are given in the current American Diabetes Association position statement regarding diabetic patients with concurrent exocrine pancreatic disease. Human diabetics with hypertriglyceridemia have increased risk of acute pancreatitis and current management recommendations
include a fat-restricted diet (Athyros et al, 2002).
> Dietary recommendations for gestational diabetes

Diabetes

In the supplemental American Diabetes Association position statement focusing on gestational
diabetes (Franz et al, 2002b), it is noted that restriction of dietary carbohydrate has been shown to
decrease maternal postprandial glucose levels (Major et al, 1998). Similarly, bitches with diestrusassociated insulin resistance might benefit from a carbohydrate-restricted diet. This would likely
reduce postprandial blood glucose fluctuations, helping to alleviate the hyperinsulinemia associated with diestrus, thus preserving beta cell function and reducing the risk of overt diabetes. There
is some evidence that reduced intake of total fat, particularly saturated fat, in people might improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk for insulin resistance-associated diabetes (Franz et al,
2002a). Potentially, feeding a fat-restricted diet to bitches with diestrus-associated insulin resistance might improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of overt diabetes. As both fat and carbohydrate restriction may be recommended for these animals, a high-protein diet is a rational
choice.
Importantly, nutrient-restricted diets should never be recommended for pregnant bitches unless
there is strong scientific evidence for both maternal and fetal benefit.
> Dietary recommendations for older diabetics

© Lanceau

There are no evidence-based nutritional recommendations for aging diabetic persons and they
must be extrapolated from what is known for the general population (Franz et al, 2002a). There is
strong evidence that energy requirements for older adults are less than those for younger adults,
however it is pointed out that under-nutrition is more likely than over-nutrition in elderly people.
Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing weight-loss diets (Franz et al, 2002a).

Evidence-based approach
Recommendations for feeding diabetic dogs should ideally be
based on evidence provided by results of randomized, controlled clinical trials that clearly document significant clinical
value of the test diet. Whenever this is lacking, clinicians must
assess the best evidence that is available and interpret this in
the light of expert clinical experience and knowledge of current pathophysiological concepts.

Diabetes

To assist this process, evidence in the following review has
been ranked into categories (Table 2):
1. Randomized, controlled, clinical trials in diabetic dogs
2. Other clinical trials in diabetic dogs
3. Randomized, controlled, clinical trials in non-diabetic dogs
4. Expert opinion, clinical experience, and pathophysiological rationale

General goals of nutritional therapy
for diabetic dogs
• Evidence based on expert opinion, clinical experience,
and pathophysiological rationale
The diet of diabetic dogs should provide adequate calories to achieve and maintain optimal body
condition. Dogs with poorly controlled diabetes have a decreased ability to metabolize the
nutrients absorbed from their gastrointestinal tract and lose glucose in their urine and so may
require more calories for maintenance than healthy dogs. The diet fed should be nutritionally
balanced and needs to be palatable so that food intake is predictable. Meals should ideally be timed
so that maximal exogenous insulin activity occurs during the postprandial period (Church, 1982).
Because the daily insulin-dosing regimen tends to be fixed for diabetic dogs, it is also important
that a predictable glycemic response is achieved following each meal. Consequently, every meal
should contain roughly the same ingredients and calorie content, and should be fed at the same
time each day. The owners of diabetic dogs should be aware that a consistent insulin-dosing and
feeding routine is optimal.

Dietary fiber and canine diabetes
> Total dietary fiber

• Evidence based on various clinical
trials in diabetic dogs
Some studies in diabetic dogs have indicated that high-fiber diets might be associated with improved glycemic control. However, these studies have compared high-fiber (56-73 g/1000kcal and
15%DM) with lower-fiber (16-27 g/1000 kcal) diets without including comparison with a control
diet formulated for typical canine adult maintenance. Thus, there has not been a clear demonstration of clinical benefit for diabetic dogs fed a high-fiber formulation compared with feeding a
typical adult maintenance diet.
Additionally, low-fiber diets typically contain increased dietary starch content, which might be a
confounding factor when comparing the glycemic responses of diabetic dogs to high- and lowfiber diets. Regardless of the composition of the high-fiber diet or the length of time over which
the diabetic dogs were monitored, no significant difference in daily insulin requirement (Nelson et
202

al, 1991; Graham et al, 1994; Nelson et al, 1998, 2000; Kimmel et al, 2000; Graham et al, 2002) or fasting triglyceride levels (Nelson et al, 1991, 1998; Graham et al, 2002) between groups of diabetic

dogs fed low-fiber and high-fiber diets has been found.
Importantly, there seems to be marked variation between the responses of individual diabetic dogs
to dietary fiber. In one study (Nelson et al, 1998), significant improvement of all indices of glyce-

mic control, including lowered daily insulin requirement, was seen in 9 of 11 dogs when they were
fed a high-fiber diet (64.4g/1000kcal). The remaining 2 dogs were found to have improved glycemic control on the lower-fiber diet (27.0g/1000kcal or 11% in 4000kcal/kg of food).

Diabetes

In another study of 12 diabetic dogs (Nelson et al, 2000), glycemic control was best in 6 dogs when
fed a soy-based, moderate-fiber diet (total dietary fiber 8% DMB), in 4 dogs when fed a cellulosebased, high-fiber diet (total dietary fiber 16% DMB), in 1 dog when fed a cellulose-based, moderate-fiber diet (total dietary fiber 8% DMB), and glycemic response to diet could not be ranked in
the remaining dog. A similar situation exists for people because high-fiber diets do not have a uniform effect in all diabetic subjects (EASD, 1988). This might be partly due to the side effects that
are sometimes associated with high-fiber diets, which include poor palatability, poor weight gain,
poor hair coat, vomiting, voluminous feces, flatulence, diarrhea, and constipation. Individual tolerance to dietary fiber is dependent on a large number of factors, including the quality and type of
the fiber.

• Evidence based on a randomized,
controlled, clinical trial in diabetic dogs
A randomized, controlled, trial was performed to assess the influence of canned, high-fiber, moderate-starch diets on insulin requirement and glycemic control in dogs with stabilized diabetes (Fleeman & Rand, 2003). The two trial diets had high-fiber (50g/1000kcal) and moderate-starch (26%
ME) content, but varied in fat content (31% ME and 48% ME). The control diet was a commercial dog food formulated for adult maintenance with moderate-fiber (35g/1000kcal), low-starch (2.3% ME), and higher fat (61% ME) content.
Diabetic control evaluated every 2 weeks included history, physical examination, and 2-hourly
blood glucose measurements over 12 hours. Insulin dose was adjusted based on standardized criteria to maintain control of glycemia. At the end of each 2 month feeding period, glycemic control
was evaluated by plasma fructosamine, glycosylated hemoglobin, and 48 hour serial blood glucose measurements. No significant differences in insulin requirement or glycemic response among
diets were found. It was concluded that, for stable diabetic dogs, high-fiber, moderate-starch diets
offer no significant advantage for insulin requirement or glycemic control compared with a commercial diet formulated for adult maintenance with moderate-fiber and low-starch content.

Soluble fiber: Dietary fiber can be characterized by degree of solubility, which is a reflection of its
properties in an aqueous media. Soluble fiber, as provided by guar gum and psyllium, has great
water-holding capacity, and forms a viscous solution in the intestine.

Dogs fed diets with increased viscosity might have more rapid postprandial glucose absorption,
resulting in higher total postprandial glucose absorption and are more likely to develop secretory
diarrhea than dogs fed diets with lower viscosity (Nelson & Sunvold, 1998b).
This suggests that only diets with an intermediate viscosity (solubility) level might be associated
with a delay in gastrointestinal transit time and optimal glucose homeostasis in dogs.
Soluble fiber, with the exception of psyllium, is usually also fermentable fiber.

2 - What to feed diabetic dogs

Fermentable fiber: Dietary fiber can be characterized by degree of fermentability, as well as solubility. Fermentable fiber is readily degraded by colonic microflora in dogs to produce short-chain
fatty acids that are absorbed across the intestinal mucosa.

Fermentable dietary fiber is associated with increased intestinal glucose transport capacity, increased glucagon-like-peptide-1, and increased insulin secretion in non-diabetic dogs (Massimino et al,
1998). The overall effect is a significant reduction of the area under the blood glucose concentration versus time curve during oral glucose tolerance testing. As diabetic dogs lack the capacity to
increase insulin secretion and match increased intestinal glucose transport, it needs to be investigated whether they benefit from diets containing high levels of fermentable fiber or whether these
diets may actually contribute to glucose intolerance.

Diabetes

Insoluble, non-fermentable fiber: Dogs cannot digest the insoluble fiber component of their diet
and it is excreted in the feces. In contrast to soluble fiber, insoluble fiber such as purified cellulose seems to exert relatively little physiological effect in the canine gut and can be tolerated in fairly high dietary levels (Bauer & Maskell, 1995).

• Evidence based on a randomized, controlled,
trial in non-diabetic dogs
A randomized controlled evaluation in non-diabetic dogs of the effects of diets containing different fiber types (highly-soluble, highly-fermentable guar gum, poorly-soluble, poorly-fermentable
cellulose, and mixed soluble-insoluble, moderately-fermentable sugar beet pulp fiber) at three different dietary concentrations has helped to clarify some of the issues relating to the putative glucoregulatory effects of dietary fiber in dogs (Hoenig et al, 2001) (Figure 5). The different test diets
were obtained by substituting 3.5%DM of cornstarch in the control diet with the fiber sources
mentioned above. The total dietary fiber level varied between 4.9% and 17.2%DM (Hoenig et al,
2001).
Compared with the control diets (total dietary fiber 3.5% and 4.4%DM), there were no significant differences in physical findings, serum glucose and insulin concentrations during oral glucose
tolerance testing, serum triglyceride concentrations, or cholesterol content of HDL, LDL, and
VLDL associated with feeding any of the fiber-modified diets. The only significant findings were
that total serum cholesterol concentrations were lower in dogs fed sugar beet fiber and higher in
dogs fed cellulose fiber, compared with control diets. Although it was not objectively measured, it
was noted that the dogs’ coat hairs seemed to become dull and lusterless when they consumed the
fiber-modified diets.

Glycemic control is statistically similar when diabetic

suggest that a blend of soluble and insoluble fiber
such as soy or beet pulp might be preferable to
insoluble fiber such as cellulose in lower-fiber diets
(total dietary fiber 8%DM) (Nelson et al, 2000).

204

The authors proposed that this might have been due to an inhibitory effect of fiber on the absorption of minerals and vitamins.

• Evidence based on various clinical trials
in diabetic dogs
When dogs were fed a single meal containing added soluble fiber or added insoluble fiber, a greater reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia was seen with the meal containing soluble fiber (Blaxter et al, 1990) although the dietary fiber composition of the diets was not reported and were probably not comparable (Davis, 1990).

Diabetes

When comparisons were made following long-term feeding for 1 or 2 months of diets high in
soluble fiber or insoluble fiber (34g/1000kcal soluble fiber versus 60g/1000kcal insoluble fiber)
(Nelson et al, 1991); 10g/1000kcal soluble fiber versus 73g/1000kcal insoluble fiber (Kimmel et al,
2000)), a tendency for improved glycemic control and fewer side effects was seen with the diets
containing increased insoluble fiber. In particular, significantly lower glycosylated hemoglobin
(Nelson et al, 1991) or fructosamine (Kimmel et al, 2000) levels were recorded. The current evidence
regarding dietary fiber and canine diabetes mellitus is summarized in Table 3.

• There has been no clear demonstration of clinical benefit for diabetic dogs of feeding high-fiber

• Regardless of the composition of the high-fiber diet or the length of time over which the diabetic
dogs were monitored, no significant difference in insulin requirement between groups of diabetic
dogs fed low-fiber and high-fiber diets has been found
• Some diabetic dogs might have improved glycemic control when fed diets with increased fiber
content, although there is marked variation among the responses of individual dogs to dietary
fiber
• For non-diabetic dogs, there are no significant differences in physical findings, serum glucose and
insulin concentrations during oral glucose tolerance testing, serum triglyceride concentrations, or
cholesterol content of HDL, LDL, and VLDL associated with feeding diets containing different
quantities of fiber and fiber sources

Evidence-based recommendations regarding
the type of dietary fiber fed to diabetic dogs

• In diabetic dogs fed high-fiber diets, there is a tendency for improved glycemic control and fewer
side effects when diabetic dogs are fed diets containing increased insoluble fiber, compared with
increased soluble fiber
• In diabetic dogs fed moderate-fiber diets, a blend of soluble and insoluble fiber such as soy or
beet pulp might be preferable to insoluble fiber alone (such as cellulose)

Summary

• The most suitable dietary fiber recommendation for diabetic dogs might be moderate-fiber
formulations (for example, 35 g/1000kcal) containing a blend of soluble and insoluble fiber,
such as soy or sugar beet pulp
• Further research is required to demonstrate clinical benefit of this formulation for diabetic dogs
compared with typical commercial dog foods formulated for adult maintenance

starch 0.4-52.7% DMB), regardless of the carbohydrate source
or type, or of the composition profile of other macronutrients
(Nguyen et al, 1998b). Although similar studies have not been
performed in diabetic dogs, there is very good evidence in diabetic people for a strong association between the insulin dosage requirement and the carbohydrate content of the meal,
regardless of the glycemic index (Figure 6), the carbohydrate
source or type, or the composition profile of other macronutrients (Franz et al, 2002a). The same might be true for diabetic
dogs.

time

In man, GI does not necessarily represent a practical guide for
evaluating foods because data can be in conflict depending on the
composition of the meal, the processing method, cooking, etc.
Answers can also vary amongst individuals. In animals, results
are more reliable because the diet can be better controlled.

The digestibility of whole cereal
grains (in this case rice) is lower
than that of the same cereal
ground into meal.

206

The postprandial glycemic response to dietary carbohydrate
might be potentially influenced by the type of carbohydrate and
by the way it has been processed. Digestion of dietary carbohydrate occurs in the small intestine of dogs and results in the
breakdown of starch to glucose, fructose, and galactose. The
postprandial glycemic response is directly dependent on the
absorption of glucose, because fructose and galactose require
hepatic metabolism for conversion to glucose. Thus, the type of
starch contained in the dietary carbohydrate fed might influence the postprandial glycemic response. Carbohydrate sources
that predominantly breakdown to glucose during digestion are
likely to result in the greatest postprandial glycemic response.

Studies assessing the digestibility in dogs of different dietary carbohydrate substrates (Murray et al,
1999; Bednar et al, 2000; Twomey et al, 2002), have found that the processing method as well as the
carbohydrate source significantly influences digestibility (Bednar et al, 2000). For example, barley
flour is approximately five times more digestible in dogs compared with barley grain, while rice
flour is almost ten times more digestible than white rice grain (Bednar et al, 2000). When commercial dog foods are formulated, the dietary starch is usually in the form of flours prepared using
a combination of roller milling, sieving, and steam cooking (Murray et al, 1999). The extrusion
process then tends to gelatinize the starch and make it even more digestible (Camire, 1998), so
that starch digestibility is essentially 100% for most carbohydrate sources included in commercial
dry dog foods (Murray et al, 1999; Twomey et al, 2002). There is some evidence that the gelling agents
used in canned commercial dog foods may similarly increase digestibility (Karr-Lilienthal et al, 2002).
Thus, for most commercial dog foods, processing effects likely have minimal influence on the postprandial glycemic response and the major potential influence on the postprandial glycemic response is likely the dietary carbohydrate source.

2 - What to feed diabetic dogs

• Evidence based on a randomized
trial in non-diabetic dogs

Diabetes

Little is known about the glycemic responses of diabetic dogs to different sources of dietary carbohydrate. However, a study in non-diabetic dogs that examined the postprandial effects of five
diets with equivalent starch content (30% DMB) from different cereal sources found marked differences in the glucose and insulin responses (Sunvold & Bouchard, 1998; Bouchard & Sunvold, 2001).
The rice-based diet resulted in significantly higher postprandial glucose and insulin responses. Sorghum generally caused the lowest postprandial glucose response while barley produced the lowest
insulin response. These findings form an interesting basis for future study on the effects of diets
containing sorghum in diabetic dogs, but more work is required before specific recommendations
can be made. Caution is required when extrapolating the results of dietary carbohydrate studies
in non-diabetic dogs to clinical recommendations for diabetic dogs. This is because all diabetic
dogs require exogenous insulin therapy, which has an overwhelming effect on carbohydrate metabolism and the postprandial glycemic response. It is also worth noting that studies in people have
found a marked variability in the glycemic response to different types of barley (Liljeberg et al, 1996)
and rice (Jarvi et al, 1995). The same is likely true for dogs.
The current evidence regarding dietary carbohydrate and canine diabetes mellitus is summarized
in Table 4.

Dietary fat
and canine diabetes
> Evidence based on expert opinion, clinical experience,
and pathophysiological rationale

Diabetes

Altered lipid metabolism occurs with insulin deficiency in dogs, yet there are minimal published
data on the influence of dietary fat on diabetic dogs. In human patients, the lipid disorders that
occur in association with diabetes are atherogenic and predispose to coronary artery disease (Stamler et al, 1993). Restricted-fat diets reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic
people. Although atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease are not usually a clinical concern in
diabetic dogs, atherosclerosis does occur in association with spontaneous canine diabetes (Sottiaux,
1999; Hess et al, 2003). Perhaps of greater clinical relevance is that diabetes secondary to exocrine pancreatic disease appears to be common in dogs, and the diabetic state might also be a risk
factor for pancreatitis. High-fat diets and hypertriglyceridemia have been proposed as possible inciting causes of canine pancreatitis (Simpson, 1993; Williams, 1994). Low-fat diets (for example fat
< 20% ME) are recommended for dogs with chronic pancreatitis. As it can be difficult to identify those diabetic dogs with subclinical pancreatitis (Wiberg et al, 1999), it might be prudent to consider feeding a restricted-fat diet (for example fat< 30% ME) to all diabetic dogs. This might have
the added benefit of improving insulin sensitivity in animals with insulin resistance-associated diabetes and reducing the risk of overt diabetes in bitches during diestrus. However, greater levels of
energy restriction might lead to undesirable weight loss
> Evidence based on a randomized, controlled,
clinical trial in diabetic dogs

The same randomized, controlled trial that assessed the influence of canned, high-fiber, moderate-starch diets on insulin requirement and glycemic control of dogs with stabilized diabetes also
assessed the influence of dietary fat (Fleeman & Rand, 2003). Different amounts of dietary fat in
the high-fiber (50 g/1000 kcal), moderate starch (26 % ME) diets had no significant influence on
insulin requirement or glycemic control of the dogs. Lower dietary fat content (31% ME compared with 48% ME) was associated with significantly improved lipid profiles. The low fat, high fiber,
moderate starch diet resulted in significantly lower mean total cholesterol concentration compared with either of the other diets, and significantly lower mean glycerol and free fatty acids than
the commercial diet. It is unknown whether any health benefits for dogs might be attributed to
these improvements in the lipid profile. Significant weight loss occurred when the dogs were fed
the low-fat, high-fiber, moderate-starch diet, whereas maintenance of weight was achieved with
both of the other diets. It was concluded that diets with lower fat content may result in improved
lipid profiles in diabetic dogs, but might contribute to undesirable weight loss. Therefore, restricted-fat diets should not routinely be recommended for diabetic dogs with thin body condition.
The current evidence regarding dietary fat and canine diabetes mellitus is summarized in Table 5.

Dietary protein
and canine diabetes
> Evidence based on pathophysiological rationale

The optimal dietary protein for diabetic dogs has not been determined and it is rational that recommendations would be no different than for non-diabetic dogs. As restriction of dietary carbohydrate
might reduce postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetic dogs and dietary fat restriction might be
beneficial if there is concurrent pancreatitis, there will be a tendency for suitable diets to have
higher protein levels (>30%ME).

208

Microalbuminuria and proteinuria do occur in diabetic dogs (Struble et al, 1998) and lower dietary protein intake may be indicated in diabetic dogs with microalbuminuria.

TABLE 5 - SUMMARY OF CURRENT EVIDENCE REGARDING DIETARY FAT
AND CANINE DIABETES MELLITUS

Evidence-based recommendations
regarding canine diabetes and
dietary fat

Summary

• The primary goal regarding dietary fat restriction in human diabetics is to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease
• As coronary heart disease is not recognized as a significant clinical entity in dogs, it might not be relevant to
extrapolate dietary fat recommendations for human patients to diabetic dogs
• Diabetes secondary to exocrine pancreatic disease appears to be common in dogs, and the diabetic state might also
be a risk factor for pancreatitis. As low-fat diets (for example fat< 20% ME) are recommended for dogs with chronic
pancreatitis, in addition, since it can be difficult to identify those diabetic dogs with subclinical pancreatitis, it might
be prudent to consider feeding a fat-restricted diet (for example fat< 30% ME) to all diabetic dogs
• However, results of a randomized, controlled clincial trial in diabetic dogs indicate that diets with lower fat content
(31% ME compared with 48% ME) may result in improved lipid profiles but may contribute to undesirable weight
loss
• Although evidence of clinical benefit of feeding fat-restricted diets (< 30% ME) to diabetic dogs is lacking,
this option may be considered for diabetic dogs with concurrent pancreatitis
• To avoid undesirable weight loss, restricted-fat diets (< 30% ME) should not routinely be recommended for diabetic
dogs in poor body condition

Dietary L-carnitine
and canine diabetes
> Evidence based on pathophysiological rationale

L-Carnitine is a conditionally essential, vitamin-like nutrient that plays a pivotal role in fatty acid
metabolism. Supplemental L-Carnitine suppresses acidosis and ketogenesis during starvation in
dogs (Rodriguez et al, 1986). L-Carnitine supplementation at 50 ppm of diets fed to dogs enhances
energy conversion from fatty acid oxidation and protects muscles from catabolism during weight
loss (Gross et al, 1998; Sunvold et al, 1999; Center, 2001). Dogs with poorly controlled diabetes experience weight loss, altered fat metabolism, ketogenesis, and hepatic changes, and so are likely to
benefit from dietary L-carnitine supplementation. The majority of diabetic dogs are middle-aged
and older and can be expected to already have reduced lean body mass (Kealy et al, 2002) before
the onset of diabetes-associated weight loss. Consequently, it is important to consider any dietary intervention, such as L-carnitine supplementation, that promotes maintenance of lean body
mass in these animals.

Dietary chromium and canine diabetes
> Evidence based on pathophysiological rationale
and a controlled clinical trial in diabetic dogs

Chromium tripicolinate is a dietary mineral supplement that has been shown to increase the clearance rate of glucose from the blood by approximately 10% in healthy dogs (Spears et al, 1998).
However this potential benefit is only possible if there is chromium deficiency because chromium
is a nutrient, not a drug. Thus, supplementation may only result in benefits if the individual is
deficient or marginally deficient in chromium.
It is now clear that dietary chromium levels of people in industrialized countries are sub-optimal
(Anderson, 1998). Similar information is not available for dogs and further studies are warranted
to try and establish the minimum recommended dietary chromium intake for healthy dogs.

2 - What to feed diabetic dogs

Chromium is thought to potentiate insulin’s ability to store glucose and would theoretically be
useful in dogs with insulin resistance or as an adjunct to exogenous insulin therapy. It is also possible that inadequate dietary intake of chromium by dogs might increase their risk of developing
diabetes. It has been postulated that some insulin-dependent diabetic people might lose their ability to convert inorganic chromium to the biologically active form and might actually need to
consume foods that contain active forms of chromium (Anderson, 1992). At this stage, there is little information available on the effects of chromium supplementation in human patients requiring
insulin therapy (Ravina et al, 1995; Fox et al, 1998). Supplementation with chromium picolinate
capsules has not been found to improve glycemic control in insulin-treated dogs (Schachter et al,
2001). The influence of chromium supplementation on bitches with diestrus-induced insulin resistance is unknown.

Diabetes

Dietary chromium supplements usually contain low molecular weight chromium salts such as trivalent chromium [Cr(III)], which has a large safety margin but can be toxic at very high doses
(Jeejeebhoy, 1999). In contrast, oral hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] appears to be 10-100 times
more toxic than trivalent chromium compounds and is an unsuitable dietary supplement (Katz &
Salam, 1993).

SUMMARY OF DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CANINE DIABETICS
The American Diabetes Association uses a grading system to rank the

scientific principles of their nutritional recommendations.
- The highest ranking, Grade A, is assigned when there is supportive
evidence from multiple, well-conducted studies
- Grade B is an intermediate rating
- Grade C is a lower ranking
- Grade E represents recommendations based on expert consensus.
If this grading system is used to rank the scientific basis of the nutritional
recommendations for canine diabetes, current evidence can be summarized
in the following fashion.

Grade B evidence
- Controlled evaluation in non-diabetic dogs of diets with different
amounts and types of fiber indicate that increased fiber intake
has no significant influence on glucose homeostasis, compared with
typical diets formulated for canine adult maintenance.
- Several studies in diabetic dogs indicate that high-fiber diets, compared
with low-fiber diets, might be associated with improved glycemic control.
However, randomized, controlled comparison identified no measurable
benefit for insulin requirement or glycemic control in diabetic dogs,
compared with a conventional, moderate-fiber diet formulated for adult
maintenance (Grade C evidence).
- There seems to be marked variation between the responses of individual
diabetic dogs to dietary fiber.
- High-fiber diets do not significantly improve hypertriglyceridemia in
diabetic dogs but might lower serum cholesterol concentrations.
- Supplementation with chromium capsules has not been found to improve
glycemic control in insulin-treated dogs.

210

Grade C evidence
- When lower-fiber diets are fed to diabetic dogs, a blend of soluble and
insoluble fibers (such as soy fiber or beet pulp) might be preferable to
insoluble fiber alone.
- Comparison in non-diabetic dogs found that a rice-based diet resulted
in significantly higher postprandial glucose and insulin responses, while
a sorghum-based diet caused reduced glucose responses, and barley
produced lower insulin responses.
- Diabetic dogs might benefit from dietary L-carnitine supplementation.
- Diets with lower fat content might result in improved lipid profiles in
diabetic dogs, but might also contribute to undesirable weight loss.

Grade E evidence
- The diet fed to diabetic dogs should be palatable so that food intake is
predictable
- The diet fed to diabetic dogs should be nutritionally balanced.
- The nutritional requirements of any concurrent disease may need to take
precedence over the dietary therapy for diabetes.
- As a regimen of fixed daily insulin dosages is typically used to manage
diabetic dogs, it is rational to provide a consistent amount of
carbohydrate in the meals fed each day.
- The optimal dietary protein for diabetic dogs has not been determined.
Lower dietary protein might be indicated only in diabetic dogs with
microalbuminuria or proteinuria.

A

Do diabetic dogs have significant
postprandial hyperglycemia? If they
do, how long does it last?

Yes. In non-diabetic dogs, commercial dog foods usually result in postprandial elevation of
blood glucose concentration for less than 90 minutes. Diabetic dogs lack endogenous insulin
secretion, resulting in failure of the major physiological mechanism for counter-regulation of
increasing blood glucose concentration. Consequently, postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetic
dogs is of greater magnitude and duration compared with non-diabetic dogs.

When should diabetic dogs be fed in
relation to administration of insulin
injections?

Therapy with exogenous insulin has a marked effect on postprandial hyperglycemia. Insulin
administration and meal feeding should ideally be timed so that maximal exogenous insulin
activity occurs during the postprandial period. Thus, dogs should be fed within 2 hours of subcutaneous administration of lente insulin or within 6 hours of protamine zinc insulin (Figure
2). A feasible compromise is to feed the dog immediately following the insulin injection. This
considerably simplifies the home treatment regimen for most dog owners while still allowing
good glycemic control to be readily achieved. In addition, many owners prefer this regimen
because they feel their pet is rewarded for submitting to the injection.

What should be done if a diabetic
dog will not eat?

It is crucial that the food fed to diabetic dogs is highly palatable so that food intake is predictable. If the diet is not palatable, it should be changed to a formulation that is more acceptable
to the dog. Whenever an individual diabetic dog does not reliably consume meals when they
are fed, it should be recommended that insulin injections are administered immediately after
meal feeding. If the dog consumes the meal, the full insulin dose can be administered. If the
dog refuses to eat, then administration of half the usual insulin dose should be recommended to
reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. If a diabetic dog refuses to eat a meal that it usually finds palatable, the possibility of concurrent illness should be considered and veterinary examination is
recommended.

Can diabetic dogs be fed ad libitum
or should they all be meal fed?

Diabetic dogs should ideally be fed a set number of meals per day. The daily insulin-dosing regimen tends to be fixed for diabetic dogs, and the timing of meals should be matched to insulin
administration so that a predictable glycemic response occurs at the time of maximal exogenous insulin activity. Thus, meals should be fed at the same times each day. Severe hypoglycemia has been reported in a diabetic dog that was fed ad libitum and received insulin at grossly irregular intervals (Whitley et al, 1997). The majority of diabetic dogs will readily consume
meals twice-daily if the meals are highly palatable and contain half the daily caloric requirement. For finicky eaters, the meal should be fed at the time of insulin administration and
remain available until the expected end of the period of maximal exogenous insulin activity.

Can the meals fed to a diabetic dog
be varied from day to day?

Ideally, every meal should contain the same ingredients and calorie content. This is an important aspect of diabetes management in dogs and owner compliance should be encouraged.
However, care should be taken to consider each case individually. It is usually possible to allow
some changes in the feeding regimen without compromising the clinical response of the dog.

Frequently asked questions regarding diabetes

Frequently asked questions

A

What is the recommended fiber
content of diets fed
to diabetic dogs?

There is no evidence of clinical benefit for diabetic dogs of feeding a high-fiber formulation compared with feeding a typical adult maintenance diet. There is marked variation between the responses of individual diabetic dogs to dietary fiber. Some diabetic dogs will have improved glycemic
control when fed diets with an increased amount of dietary fiber, while others will not. The response to dietary fiber must be individually assessed in each case. Increased dietary fiber intake is not
recommended for diabetic dogs that are underweight, or for dogs for which fiber-supplemented formulations are unpalatable or associated with unacceptable gastrointestinal side-effects. The most
suitable general dietary fiber recommendation for diabetic dogs may be moderate-fiber formulations (for example, 35 g/1000kcal), although further research is required to demonstrate clinical
benefit of this formulation for diabetic dogs compared with typical commercial dog foods formulated for adult maintenance.

Is a low-carbohydrate, highprotein diet now recommended for
diabetic dogs similar to the current
recommendation for diabetic cats?

Dogs and cats are prone to different types of diabetes and also have different basic macronutrient
requirements. Diabetic dogs have forms of diabetes analogous to both human type 1 diabetes and
end-stage pancreatitis, while diabetic cats have a form analogous to human type 2 diabetes. There
is no evidence that type 2 diabetes occurs in dogs, so it is not valid to extrapolate information on
either this disease or feline diabetes to dogs. Unlike dogs, a large proportion of diabetic cats have
sufficient beta cells to allow diabetic remission if glucose toxicity and its associated insulin resistance can be reversed, and there is evidence that remission rates are higher if diabetic cats are fed
a low-carbohydrate diet. This does not apply to dogs. Diabetic dogs have absolute insulin deficiency and require life-long therapy with exogenous insulin. As a regimen of fixed daily insulin dosages
is typically used to manage diabetic dogs, it is rational to provide a very consistent amount of
starch in the meals fed each day.

What is the best method
to achieve body weight gain
in a thin diabetic dog, and
weight loss in an overweight
diabetic dog?

Caloric intake in diabetic dogs should be adjusted to achieve and maintain an ideal body condition. Dogs with poorly controlled diabetes have a decreased ability to metabolize the nutrients
absorbed from their gastrointestinal tract and loose glucose in their urine, so require more calories
for maintenance than healthy dogs. Most dogs have weight loss by the time diabetes is diagnosed.
Many will be underweight while others might still be obese even though they will have experienced weight loss. Insulin therapy ends this state of catabolism and weight loss will soon be arrested.
At this stage, a weight management program can be initiated. Body weight and body condition
should be monitored regularly in all diabetic dogs and caloric intake should be adjusted at each
re-evaluation until the desired rate of gain or loss is achieved. If a diabetic dog fails to gain weight
when there is good glycemic control and adequate caloric intake, concurrent disease such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency should be considered. Conversely, a possible cause of obesity in treated diabetic dogs is excessive insulin dose, because insulin has an anabolic action on adipose tissue.

Diabetes

Q

What diet is recommended for
diabetic dogs with recurring
pancreatitis or exocrine pancreatic
insufficiency?

212

Dietary therapy for recurring pancreatitis or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is usually a higher
clinical priority than dietary therapy for diabetes. The prognosis might be improved if these

concurrent conditions are recognized early in diabetic dogs and specific nutritional and medical therapy instituted. The dietary recommendations for exocrine pancreatic diseases can be
found in Chapter 5 of this encyclopedia.

Key Points
- Incorporating cereals with a low glycemic index
to smooth out the postprandial hyperglycemic peak
- Intake of soluble and insoluble fiber to help regulate
glycemia
- Reducing the fat content due to the risk of subclinical
pancreatitis

*The number of meals must be adapted to the insulin injection protocol. Ideally, each meal must be given in such a way
that the postprandial period corresponds to the maximum period of activity of the insulin.

© Didier Schmidt-Morand

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

Cataracts are the most common complication among diabetic dogs.
The risk increases as the dog grows older. The word comes from the Greek
word kataraktès (rupture) where the crystalline lens loses its transparency
and the eye has a gray-blue opalescence.

Key Points
with respect to:

The role of nutrition in the treatment
of diabetes mellitus in dogs
Rather than a traditional maintenance diet for adult dogs, the diet
recommended for diabetic dogs and
bitches presenting with diestrusassociated insulin resistance must
meet the following key criteria:
• High palatability to guarantee
regular consumption.
• Limited starch content (<50%
carbohydrate calories): there is a
correlation between the starch
content and the dog’s glycemic response (Nguyen et al, 1998). It is easy
to lower the starch content below
30% even in dry foods. If the pancreas no longer functions (which is

218

more often the case in dogs), it is
important to adjust the insulin
dose to the starch intake every
time the diet is changed. When the
starch content of a diet is reduced,
the insulin dose must also be reduced.
• High glycemic index starches such
as rice and bread should be avoided in diabetic dogs. It is preferable to fed cereals with starch
that is digested more slowly, facilitating slower, prolonged absorption of glucose. Low glycemic index
cereals include corn, wheat, barley
and sorghum.

• A diet with a higher fiber content
compared with a standard maintenance diet for adult dogs may not
be particularly beneficial for diabetic dogs. The optimal fiber content
depends on the dog’s physical
condition, the level and source of
the starch and the nature of the
fiber used.
• Every type of fiber has its own particular properties, therefore intake
of fiber from different sources is
important

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

- Soluble, non-fermentable fiber
(e.g. fructo-oligosaccharides) improves
glucose tolerance.
- Insoluble, non-fermentable fiber
(e.g. psyllium) impacts the speed of
transit through the intestine and
the release of glucose.
NB. Beet pulp contains both insoluble and non-fermentable fiber, and
soluble and non-fermentable fiber.
• The ideal fat content depends on
the physical condition of the dog,
but diets with a high fat content
should be avoided in diabetic dogs,
due to the associated risk of pan-

creatitis. An intake of 20-35% lipid
calories appears to be sufficient,
unless the dog is in poor body
condition. There is an inverse correlation between the dietary fat
content and the postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses
(Prudhomme et al, 1999). This effect is
probably a consequence of deceleration of gastric emptying associated with high fat foods.
• If the food contains moderate starch, fiber and fat content, the protein will be the main source of
energy. There are no negative
effects associated with providing at
least 30%-45% protein calories in
the food. High protein intake helps
compensate for the catabolism of
protein and increased gluconeogenesis in diabetic dogs, especially
when the diabetes has not been
properly stabilized.

• An L-carnitine supplement helps
maintain the lean body mass.
• Diets for diabetic dogs must
contain mineral and trace-element
levels similar to those for non-diabetic dogs. Particular attention
should be given to potassium to
avoid deficiencies.
• The level of water soluble vitamins
should be increased to compensate
for losses due to polyuria.
• Oxidative stress is involved in the
pathophysiology of diabetes.
Therefore, appropriate supplementation with a blend of antioxidants
is recommended.

POINTS TO BE MONITORED BY THE OWNER OF A DIABETIC DOG
The quantities of water and food
consumed by the dog

polydipsia (accompanied by polyuria), anorexia or conversely polyphagia may be signs
of poor diabetic control

The dog’s body weight

changes in body weight may require modification of the insulin dosage. Obesity is a risk factor
contributing to insulin resistance

The dog’s level of activity

regular physical activity should be included in the list of preventative measures to reduce the incidence of
canine diabetes mellitus (Hedhammar et al, 2005)

The timing of meals

this is essential for successful treatment. Dividing the ration into two meals a day helps minimize the
hyperglycemic peaks, regardless of the type of diabetes. With insulin therapy, the meals should ideally
be served just after the insulin peaks, which vary according to the individual and the type of insulin
administered

The composition of the meal

the appropriate food should not be changed after selection, as both the quantity and the type of carbohydrate ingested have a direct impact on the postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses. Supplements,
especially sugary treats or food rich in carbohydrates should not be given to dogs with diabetes mellitus

A few simple rules help prevent complications with diabetes mellitus in dogs.

219

Diabetes

- Insoluble, non-fermentable fiber
(e.g. cellulose) is well tolerated,
even in large quantities. Varying
the content of this type of fiber
permits the adaptation of the energy density of a food to the dog’s
physical condition.

forms a gel or a viscous solution. The
viscosity of this type of fiber tends to
slow down gastro-intestinal transit
due to the simple increase in flowthrough resistance (Guilford, 1996).

Soluble fiber

The effect of fiber on the quality of
stools varies according to its ability to
be fermented by colonic bacteria.
With the exception of psyllium, most

In contact with water, soluble fiber
(pectins, gums, oligosaccharides, etc)

types of soluble fiber are degraded
by the microflora of the large intestine. The bacteria flora use the fermentable fiber as an energy source,
and in the process, generate fermentation products such as short chain
fatty acids and lactic acid which have
a trophic effect on the colonic mucosa.

The ratio that exists between fermentable and non fermentable fibers (F/nF) in the food influences the production
of putrefaction by-products in the stools.
Example: if the F/nF increases from 0.15 to 0.48, the fecal concentration in amines is 50% lower, corresponding
to a total dietary fiber content of 7.7% and 9.2%, respectively (Hernot et al, 2005).

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

mainly due to proliferation of the
bacterial biomass produced.

Insoluble fiber
Insoluble fiber regulates transit,
accelerating it during constipation
and decelerating it during diarrhea
(Guilford, 1996).
Insoluble fiber is not generally
degraded by the microflora of the

colon. As a consequence, insoluble
fiber is excreted almost fully intact in
the stools. The capacity to increase
the indigestible residue of feces
contributes to fecal consistency as
well as increasing the volume of
stools (Silvio et al, 2000). An excess
quantity of insoluble fiber in a food
is also detrimental to its good digestibility.

Diabetes

However, a excess quantities of fermentable fiber in a diet is detrimental to digestive tolerance. A diet rich
in fermentable fiber (pectins, guar
gums) increases the water content
and the volume of the feces
(Wiernusz, 1995; Silvio et al, 2000).
Furthermore, the fermentation products may induce osmotic diarrhea
by attracting free water into the
intestinal lumen. These effects are

Hyperlipidemia

Dr. Schenck received her Masters degree in Animal Science and her DVM degree from the University of Illinois
in Champaign-Urbana. After owning her own small animal practice, she returned to the University of Florida where she completed
her PhD in lipid biochemistry. After completing a post-doc at the USDA in Peoria Illinois, she joined the Ohio State University,
where she became interested in research in calcium regulation. After working in the pet food industry for a number of years,
she joined the Endocrinology section in the Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health at Michigan State University
in 2001. Her current research interests include developing new tests for increasing diagnostic utility in calcium
and lipid disorders, hyperlipidemias in the dog, idiopathic hypercalcemia in the cat,
and the relationships between lipids and parathyroid hormone.

H

yperlipidemia or hyperlipemia refers to an increased
cloudiness in serum due to an excess of circulating lipids.
The term lipemia, the presence of lipids in serum, is often
incorrectly used to describe excess circulating lipids.
Hyperlipidemia and hyperlipoproteinemia are often used
interchangeably, but hyperlipoproteinemia more correctly refers
to an excess of circulating lipoproteins. Hypercholesterolemia
and hypertriglyceridemia refer respectively to an excess of
circulating cholesterol or triglyceride. Hypercholesterolemia
or hypertriglyceridemia may occur alone or in combination
with hyperlipoproteinemia. Normally hyperlipidemia occurs
after ingesting a meal, but fasting hyperlipidemia is indicative
of abnormal lipid metabolism.

Perturbations in any aspect of lipid metabolism may result in abnormal hyperlipidemia. Abnormalities may occur in lipid absorption, synthesis, esterification, lipoprotein
synthesis, receptor-mediated uptake, bile formation and circulation, or reverse cholesterol transport.

1 - Lipid metabolism

1 - Lipid metabolism

FIGURE 1 - DIGESTION
AND ABSORPTION OF LIPIDS
(From Gogny, 1994)

Lipid absorption
Fat
globule

Cholesterol and triglycerides are absorbed in the small intestine. Cholesterol may be
ingested in the diet (exogenous), or is derived from biliary secretion and desquamation of intestinal epithelial cells (endogenous) which may account for up to 50% of
the total cholesterol present in the small intestinal lumen (Holt, 1972). Absorption
requires bile acids and micelle formation (Figure 1). Bile salts are secreted by the liver
and enter the small intestine via the bile, and most salts exist as conjugates with glycine or taurine. When the concentration of bile salts reaches a high enough level, bile
salts form aggregates or micelles (Feldman et al, 1983), and allow approximately 30 to
60% of available cholesterol to be absorbed. Within the lumen of the intestine, cholesteryl esters from micelles are hydrolyzed by pancreatic cholesterol esterase. Free cholesterol passively diffuses across the intestinal mucosal cell wall (Westergaard et al,
1976). Within the intestinal cell, free cholesterol is re-esterified with fatty acids, a process mediated by the enzyme acyl CoA:cholesterylacyltransferase (ACAT). A combination of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters are then secreted into chylomicron
particles.
Within the intestinal lumen, triglycerides are hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase to monoglycerides, diglycerides, and free fatty acids. In combination with cholesterol, phospholipid, and bile salts, these monoglycerides, diglycerides, and free fatty acids form
mixed micelles. These micelles release monoglycerides, diglycerides, and free fatty
acids at the intestinal cell wall where they are absorbed (Figure 1). Within the intestinal cell, monoglycerides and diglycerides are re-esterified to form triglycerides. Triglycerides along with cholesteryl esters, free cholesterol, phospholipid, and proteins
will be incorporated into chylomicron particles for release into the circulation via the
lymphatic system and the thoracic duct.

Cholesterol synthesis
Endogenous cholesterol synthesis contributes to the total body cholesterol concentration. Cholesterol can be synthesized by almost all cells, with the highest rate of synthesis in the liver and intestine (Turley et al, 1981). Approximately 1g cholesterol per
day is synthesized within the body from acetyl CoA. The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA reductase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in
cholesterol synthesis (Alberts, 1988).

Lipoprotein production
Lipoproteins are the main carriers of triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood and are
important in the delivery of cholesterol to all tissues. Circulating lipoproteins are classified by their size, density, and electrophoretic behavior (Mahley et al, 1974a). Lipoproteins in humans have been well characterized (Alaupovic et al, 1968; Assmann,
1982; Shepherd et al, 1989), but direct correlations cannot be made to the dog due to
many differences in lipoprotein characteristics (Mahley et al, 1974a; Mahley et al,
1974b).

unesterified cholesterol, and proteins (Assmann, 1982). Proteins within a lipoprotein tend to be
specific for that lipoprotein class.
Lipoprotein particles are not static, but are in a dynamic state of equilibrium, with transfer of components occurring between lipoproteins.
Five major classes of lipoproteins have been characterized, including:
- chylomicrons
- very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)
- intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL)
- low density lipoproteins (LDL)
- and high density lipoproteins (HDL).
Some mammals (such as humans and most monkeys) have a predominance of LDL and are classified as “LDL mammals” (Chapman, 1986). LDL mammals are more sensitive to elevations in
LDL cholesterol and the development of atherosclerosis. Dogs and most other mammals are considered “HDL mammals” due to the predominance of circulating HDL. HDL mammals are less sensitive to elevated LDL cholesterol concentrations, and are more resistant to the development of
atherosclerosis (Table 1).

1 - Lipid metabolism

In the peripheral circulation, chylomicrons gain apoprotein C and apoprotein E from HDL (Figure
2), increasing their protein content (Capurso, 1987). Lipoprotein lipase activated by apoprotein
C-II of chylomicrons hydrolyzes the triglyceride present in chylomicrons, creating a phospholipid-rich particle. Lipoprotein lipase is associated with endothelial cell surfaces, interacting with
membrane associated heparan sulfate (Nilsson-Ehle et al, 1980). Apoprotein A is transferred to
HDL, and a chylomicron remnant is formed.

Chylomicron particles containing a high concentration of
triglyceride are released from the intestinal mucosal cell into the
lymphatics and to the circulation. Lipoprotein lipase hydrolysis of
triglycerides within chylomicrons releases fatty acids and decreases
the triglyceride content of chylomicrons, creating a chylomicron
remnant. In addition, there is an exchange of apoproteins between
HDL and chylomicrons. Chylomicrons contribute apoprotein
A to HDL in exchange for apoproteins C and E. The chylomicron
remnant formed is recognized by an apoprotein E receptor on
hepatocytes and is removed from the circulation. A deficiency
of lipoprotein lipase activity can result in decreased metabolism
of chylomicrons to chylomicron remnants and thus a prolonged
appearance of chylomicrons in the circulation.

Chylomicron particles containing lipids are released from
the intestine into the circulation. Cholesterol-rich chylomicron
remnants form and are recognized by the apoprotein E receptor
on hepatocytes. Once in the hepatocyte, cholesterol can be stored
as cholesteryl ester (via the action of ACAT), can be excreted
into bile as cholesterol or bile acids, or secreted into VLDL
particles. Synthesis of cholesterol in the hepatocyte (via
HMGCoA reductase) contributes to the available cholesterol
pool. Lipoprotein lipase hydrolysis of triglyceride within secreted
VLDL and exchange of apoproteins create a triglyceride-depleted
IDL which forms the triglyceride-poor, cholesterol-enriched LDL
particle. The LDL receptor recognizes apoproteins B and E
and mediates uptake and removal of LDL from the circulation.
A deficiency of lipoprotein lipase activity can result in decreased
metabolism of VLDL to LDL and thus a prolonged appearance
of VLDL in the circulation.

Discoidal HDL (nascent HDL) is secreted by the liver and
obtains unesterified cholesterol from peripheral cells. LCAT in
the circulation esterifies this cholesterol, resulting in a more
spherical cholesteryl ester-rich particle. If cholesteryl ester transfer
protein (CETP) is present, cholesteryl ester is transferred from
HDL to LDL, with exchange of triglyceride from LDL to HDL.
LDL carrying cholesteryl ester derived from peripheral cells
returns to the liver completing reverse cholesterol transport.
In dogs with little CETP, other mechanisms exist to return
cholesterol to the liver via HDL directly.

Apoprotein E

Hyperlipidemia

Chylomicron remnant formation is necessary for hepatic clearance (Cooper, 1977). Once chylomicron remnants are formed, they are rapidly removed from the circulation by the apoprotein E
receptor in liver cells (Mahley et al, 1989).
VLDL are synthesized by hepatocytes (Figure 3), and are a major transporter of triglyceride (Mills
et al, 1971). VLDL binds to lipoprotein lipase, and lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes the triglyceride
present in VLDL. This process may create VLDL remnants which can be removed by the liver
via receptor or non-receptor-mediated uptake (Havel, 1984). HDL transfers apoprotein E to
VLDL, creating an IDL particle. With further loss of triglyceride, phospholipid, and apoprotein,
LDL is formed. Removal of LDL from the circulation is via the LDL receptor which binds both
apoprotein B and apoprotein E (Goldstein et al, 1984).

Figure 5 - The appearance of
normal and hyperlipidemic serum.
Normal serum should be clear, with no
evidence of turbidity (left tube).
Fasting serum that is turbid indicates
the presence of excess lipid in
the serum (right tube).

Nascent HDL is secreted by the liver (Figure 4), and contains very little free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester. Free cholesterol is transferred from peripheral cells to nascent HDL, and these cholesterol-rich particles serve as substrate for lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), converting free cholesterol to cholesteryl esters. With the increased concentration of cholesteryl esters,
the core of HDL enlarges and becomes more spherical. Hepatic lipase may also play a role in the
interconversion of HDL subfractions (Groot et al, 1981). The conversion of free cholesterol to
cholesteryl esters and its subsequent transfer to other lipoproteins allows additional free cholesterol to transfer from the surface of cells and other lipoproteins to HDL (Kostner et al, 1987). Thus
LCAT plays a key role in the transfer of free cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver (Albers
et al, 1986).
In humans, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is responsible for cholesteryl ester and triglyceride exchange between HDL and LDL or VLDL. Cholesteryl ester derived from free cholesterol in peripheral cells is transferred to LDL, which can then return to the liver via receptormediated uptake (reverse cholesterol transport) (Noel et al, 1984). Dogs however have low levels
of CETP (Mahley et al, 1983); thus there is little transfer of cholesteryl ester to LDL. Without cholesteryl ester transfer, HDL remains enriched with cholesteryl esters, and is designated HDL1, or
HDLc. In the dog, reverse cholesterol transport is completed via HDL uptake by the liver. The
dog is a “HDL mammal” since most of the circulating cholesterol is carried by HDL and cannot
be transferred to LDL as in humans (an “LDL mammal”).

Figure 6 - Refrigeration test of
canine hyperlipidemic serum.
On the left, a fasting serum sample
from a dog shows hyperlipidemia.
After the refrigeration test, there is the
appearance of a lactescent layer
(‘cream layer’) floating on top of the
serum. This layer is due to increased
chylomicron particles present in the
serum sample. Note that the serum
below the top lactescent layer is also
turbid, indicating the presence of other
lipoproteins in excess (in addition to
the excess chylomicron particles).

226

2 - Diagnostic approach to the
hyperlipidemic patient
When a patient exhibits serum hyperlipidemia after a 10 to 12 hour fast (Figure 5), investigation
into the cause is warranted (Figure 7). The presumption that the dog was fasted should be verified to ensure that all food and treats have been withheld. Once fasting hyperlipidemia has been
confirmed, hyperlipidemia secondary to other disorders should be investigated. If no secondary
disorder resulting in hyperlipidemia can be identified, a primary lipid abnormality should be considered.

Serum turbidity
Visual evaluation of the degree of serum turbidity can provide an estimation of serum triglyceride
concentration. Normal, clear serum typically has a triglyceride concentration of less than
200 mg/dL, while hazy serum may have a triglyceride concentration of approximately 300 mg/dL.
Opacity is seen when triglyceride concentration approaches 600 mg/dL, and if the serum has the
appearance of skim milk, the triglyceride concentration is usually around 1000 mg/dL. Serum with
the appearance of whole milk can have triglyceride concentration as high as 2500 to 4000 mg/dL.

2 - Diagnostic approach to the hyperlipidemic patient

Refrigeration test
To ascertain the lipoprotein classes that may be present in excess, a simple refrigeration test can
be performed (Figure 6). The serum sample is refrigerated and left undisturbed overnight. Chylomicrons, being the least dense lipoprotein, will ‘float’ forming a ‘cream layer’ on the top of the
serum sample (Rogers, 1977). If the serum below is clear, only chylomicrons are present in excess,
and either a non-fasted sample, or primary hyperchylomicronemia should be suspected. If the
serum below the chylomicron layer is turbid, then other lipoproteins are present in excess in addition to the hyperchylomicronemia. If a ‘cream layer’ does not form after refrigeration, then chylomicrons are not present, and the visible hyperlipidemia is due to an excess of other lipoproteins.

lipoproteins in the normal dog (a HDL mammal).

Lipoprotein
electrophoresis
Lipoprotein electrophoresis can be used
to characterize lipoproteins in serum.
With electrophoresis, lipoproteins separate based on their charge and mobility
on agarose gel. The agarose gel is then
stained and scanned using a densitometer
to semi-quantify classes of lipoproteins
(Figure 8). Lipoprotein electrophoresis
should be performed on fresh, not-previously-frozen serum, and the scan interpreted by someone knowledgeable of
canine lipoprotein characteristics (i.e.
not a human laboratory), since major differences exist between humans and dogs
in electrophoretic pattern. Lipoprotein
electrophoresis is not specific since there
is some overlap in electrophoretic migration, but is useful especially for monitoring effectiveness of treatment of lipid
abnormalities.

Ultracentrifugation
Ultracentrifugation can be utilized to separate lipoproteins based on density. Ultracentrifugation
is time-consuming, requires expensive equipment, and considerable skill to produce reliable
results, and is rarely available except in the research setting.

Serum interferences
Excess of other analytes present in serum may interfere with the measurement of lipids.
- Hyperbilirubinemia may cause a false lowering of cholesterol measurement.
- Hypertriglyceridemia may also result in a falsely lower cholesterol concentration (Cobbaert et al,
1993).
- If cholesterol is present at a concentration of greater than 700 mg/dL, the measured triglyceride
concentration may be falsely lowered (Shephard et al, 1990).
- Pentobarbital may also falsely increase triglyceride measurement (Hata et al, 1978), but phenobarbitone has no effect on cholesterol concentration (Foster et al, 2000).
Depending on methodology utilized for analysis, hyperlipidemia may interfere with a number of
assays. Hyperlipidemia may result in an approximately 2% increase in sodium, urea, glucose, chloride, and total protein measurement (Miyada et al, 1982). Total calcium measurement may be
slightly elevated (Darras et al, 1992), and cortisol may be slightly elevated, but not clinically significant (Lucena et al, 1998). Bilirubin concentration may be falsely increased (Ng et al, 2001), and
immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin M, haptoglobin and ·1-antitrypsin concentration may also
be falsely increased (Bossuyt et al, 1999). Concentration of LDH is decreased and AST and ALT
concentrations are increased (Miyada et al, 1982). Hypertriglyceridemia may interfere with WBC,
RBC, hemoglobin and platelet measurements (Peng et al, 2001), and causes a false increase in haptoglobin concentration (Weidmeyer et al, 1996). Glycated hemoglobin measurement may be falsely decreased (Garrib et al, 2003), and free thyroxine measured by ELISA may be increased (Lucena et al, 1998). However, triglyceride concentration up to 1000 mg/dL will not interfere with phenobarbital measurement (Baer et al, 1987).

228

Hypothyroidism is the most common endocrine disease in dogs and often causes serum hyperlipidemia. In a survey of 2007 dogs with reported recurrent hyperlipidemia, 413 (21%) were diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Dogs with fasting hyperlipidemia were 3.2 times more likely to have
hypothyroidism than dogs that did not have hyperlipidemia (Schenck, 2004).
Increases in both serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations have been associated with
canine hypothyroidism (Rogers et al, 1975b; Boretti et al, 2003). In one study of 50 dogs with hypothyroidism, 88% exhibited hypertriglyceridemia and 78% had hypercholesterolemia (Dixon et al,
1999). Congenital hypothyroidism resulted in hypercholesterolemia in 4 out of 5 Giant Schnauzers (Greco et al, 1991). Cholesterol elevations are usually moderate (Jaggy et al, 1994), and with
adequate treatment of hypothyroidism, both cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations return to
normal (Rogers et al, 1975b; Cortese et al, 1997). In dogs with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia associated with hypothyroidism, there are increases in VLDL, LDL and HDL1 (Mahley et al, 1974b; Rogers et al, 1975b), and the lipoprotein electrophoresis pattern should return to
normal with thyroid replacement therapy. Cholesterol accumulation is seen in VLDL, and these
cholesterol-rich particles may stimulate cholesteryl ester synthesis within tissue macrophages
(Mahley et al, 1980).
In humans with hypothyroidism, mRNA for LDL receptors is decreased resulting in decreased
cholesterol and chylomicron clearance (Kovanen, 1987). Lipoprotein lipase activity may be
increased (Hansson et al, 1983), diminished (Pykalisto et al, 1976) or unaltered (Franco et al, 2003),
and there is decreased excretion of cholesterol into bile (Gebhard et al, 1992). Cholesterol synthesis is also decreased, but the decrease in clearance is greater than the decrease in synthesis, leading to a net increase in cholesterol concentration (Field et al, 1986).

3 - Causes of hyperlipidemia

Hyperlipidemia may be the result of lipid abnormalities secondary to a number of other conditions (Table 3). Conditions resulting in secondary hyperlipidemia include hypothyroidism, pancreatitis, cholestasis, hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, nephrotic syndrome, obesity, and
the feeding of very high fat diets. These conditions should be investigated and eliminated as potential causes of the hyperlipidemia before primary hyperlipidemia is considered.

Pancreatitis usually results in hyperlipidemia with an increase in both serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, but the lipoprotein electrophoresis pattern remains normal until 48 to
72 hours post-induction of pancreatitis (Whitney et al, 1987). Free fatty acids and β-migrating lipoproteins (VLDL and LDL) increase (Rogers et al, 1975b; Whitney et al, 1987; Chikamune et al,
1998), and there is a consistent decrease in α1-migrating lipoprotein (HDL2) (Bass et al, 1976;
Whitney et al, 1987). Changes in α2-migrating lipoproteins (HDL1) are inconsistent, and may be
increased or decreased (Whitney et al, 1987). In addition, there may be other differences in the
lipoprotein electrophoresis pattern depending on whether the pancreatitis is naturally occurring
or experimentally induced.
Within the lipoprotein structure, there are changes in lipid and protein content in pancreatitis.
LDL exhibits an increase in triglyceride, total cholesterol, and phospholipid, and an increase of
apoprotein B100 (Chikamune et al, 1998). VLDL shows an increase in total cholesterol and phospholipid. HDL particles have decreased total cholesterol and phospholipid, with an increase in
apoprotein A-IV and a decrease in apoprotein A-I (Chikamune et al, 1998).

Pancreatitis

Naturally occurring atherosclerosis has
been noted in dogs with hypothyroidism. In a family of Beagles with hypothyroidism, there was evidence of
moderate to severe atherosclerosis
which occurred mainly in the coronary
and renal arteries (Manning, 1979).
Arteries were stenotic but patent, with
no evidence of prior occlusion. Even
with therapy for hypothyroidism, no
regression of atherosclerotic plaques
was seen despite a decrease in serum
cholesterol concentration (DePalma et
al, 1977).
229

3 - Causes of hyperlipidemia

In humans, there is evidence that pancreatitis is associated with decreased lipoprotein lipase activity (Hazzard et al, 1984). This decreased activity of lipoprotein lipase may result in increased triglyceride concentrations with slower clearance of chylomicrons. Two dogs with pancreatitis also
exhibited a moderate decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity, which returned to normal with treatment and resolution of the pancreatitis (Schenck, unpublished observations).

Diabetes mellitus
In diabetes mellitus, elevations of both serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentration are typically observed (Rogers et al, 1975b; Renauld et al, 1998) (Table 4).

(Wilson et al, 1986)

Cholesterol concentration increases in VLDL and IDL, and decreases in HDL (Wilson et al, 1986).
Insulin therapy will usually decrease serum triglyceride concentration, but serum cholesterol
concentration may remain elevated due to increased cholesterol synthesis (Gleeson et al, 1990)
(Figure 8).
In humans with diabetes mellitus, lipoprotein lipase activity is decreased, with an increase in free
fatty acids (Steiner et al, 1975) and hepatic lipase activity (Muller et al, 1985). Urinary mevalonate concentration is elevated approximately 6-fold, indicating an increase in whole-body cholesterol synthesis, and HMGCoA reductase activity is increased (Kwong et al, 1991; Feingold et al,
1994). Intestinal cholesterol absorption may also be increased in diabetes mellitus (Kwong et al,
1991) (Gylling et al, 1996). There is impaired removal of VLDL from the circulation (Wilson et al,
1986), and a decrease in the number and affinity of LDL receptors (Takeuchi, 1991). Prolonged
retention of lipoprotein remnants may contribute to an increased delivery of cholesterol to extrahepatic tissues, and the increased concentration of HDL1 reflects a disturbance in cholesterol
transport from peripheral cells back to the liver (Wilson et al, 1986).
Naturally occurring atherosclerosis has been observed at necropsy in a dog with diabetes mellitus
(Sottiaux, 1999). Atherosclerotic plaques were noted in the terminal aorta, coronary arteries, renal
arteries, and arteries of the brain, but there was no evidence of thrombosis or complete occlusion
of any vessel.

Nephrotic syndrome
Lipoprotein abnormalities have been poorly characterized in dogs with nephrotic syndrome. Dogs
with nephrotic syndrome show a mild increase in serum cholesterol concentration early in the
course of disease, with a mild elevation of serum triglyceride concentration occurring later. Dogs
with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic renal failure exhibit a decrease in lipoprotein
lipase activity, resulting in impaired removal of lipid from the circulation (Akmal et al, 1990).
Lipoprotein abnormalities in nephrotic syndrome and chronic renal disease have been well characterized in humans, and the progression of renal dysfunction has been shown to correlate with
serum total cholesterol (Washio et al, 1996). Lipoprotein lipase activity is decreased which may
account for the hypertriglyceridemia due to a decrease in lipoprotein clearance (Olbricht, 1991).
There is decreased clearance of LDL (Shapiro, 1991; Vaziri et al, 1996) due to decreased LDL receptor expression (Portman et al, 1992). LDL may also be increased due to an increase in synthesis
(de Sain-van der Velden et al, 1998). HMGCoA reductase activity is increased in the liver (Szolkiewicz et al, 2002; Chmielewski et al, 2003), and the increased cholesterol does not up-regulate
LDL receptors (Liang et al, 1997). Reverse cholesterol transport is impaired (Kes et al, 2002), and
ACAT activity within the liver is increased with a decrease in LCAT activity (Liang et al, 2002).
VLDL increases due to decreased catabolism (de Sain-van der Velden et al, 1998), and proteinuria
may also stimulate VLDL synthesis by the liver, induced by hypoalbuminemia (D'Amico, 1991).
Impaired clearance of VLDL may be due to deficiencies in apoprotein C-II, apoprotein C-III, and

230

3 - Causes of hyperlipidemia

apoprotein E, creating smaller VLDL particles that are not cleared efficiently by receptors (Deighan et al, 2000). This altered structure of VLDL results in altered binding to endothelial bound
lipoprotein lipase (Shearer et al, 2001), and proteinuria may also be associated with the urinary
loss of heparan sulfate, an important cofactor for lipoprotein lipase (Kaysen et al, 1986). Synthesis of apoprotein A-I by the liver increases in response to proteinuria (Marsh, 1996), and protein
catabolism in peripheral tissues is increased.

Hyperadrenocorticism
In hyperadrenocorticism, mild elevations of both serum cholesterol and triglyceride may be seen
in dogs and humans (Friedman et al, 1996). Lipoprotein lipase activity is decreased with an increase
in hepatic lipase activity (Berg et al, 1990). In addition, hypercortisolism stimulates production of
VLDL by the liver (Taskinen et al, 1983). Excess glucocorticoids stimulate lipolysis, and this excess
fat breakdown exceeds the liver’s capacity for clearance. The occurrence of steroid hepatopathy
in hyperadrenocorticism may lead to biliary stasis resulting in further lipid abnormalities.

In hyperadrenocorticism, mild
elevations of both serum cholesterol
and triglyceride may be seen (Ling
et al, 1979; Reusch et al, 1991).
In dogs, concentration of β-migrating
lipoproteins (VLDL and LDL) are
typically increased (Bilzer, 1991).

Cholestasis

Hyperlipidemia

In cholestasis, there is typically moderate hypercholesterolemia, and there may be a mild hypertriglyceridemia (Chuang et al, 1995). Concentration of LDL increases, and HDL1 concentration
decreases (Danielsson et al, 1977). In LDL, phospholipid content increases and triglyceride concentration decreases, but there is no change in composition of HDL. Both plasma cholesteryl ester
and LCAT activity increases (Blomhoff et al, 1978).

Obesity
Some obese dogs show an increase in serum triglyceride concentration (Bailhache et al, 2003), and
a mild increase in serum cholesterol (Chikamune et al, 1995). Free fatty acids are increased, triglyceride concentration is increased in both VLDL and HDL, and
HDL cholesterol may be decreased (Bailhache et al, 2003). Phospholipid concentration is increased in both VLDL and LDL, and is
decreased in HDL2 (Chikamune et al, 1995). There is a moderate
decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity in some obese dogs, and activity increases with weight loss (Schenck, unpublished observation).
Lipid abnormalities observed in obese dogs may however be secondary to insulin resistance (Bailhache et al, 2003).

Obesity may result in hyperlipidemia
in a small percentage of dogs.

High fat diets

© M. Diez

The feeding of high fat diets may result in hyperlipidemia and moderate elevation in serum cholesterol concentration. As serum cholesterol concentration increases, the majority of cholesterol is carried
by HDLc (HDL1); thus an increase in α2-migrating lipoprotein is
observed (Mahley et al, 1974b). A substantial portion of the HDL
observed in response to cholesterol feeding is formed in the periphery (Sloop et al, 1983). Once this HDL reaches the plasma, it is
converted to HDLc via the action of LCAT, which exhibits increased activity (Bauer, 2003). LDL and IDL concentrations increase,
and the concentration of HDL2 decreases. Hypercholesterolemia
results in the appearance of α-migrating VLDL, and cholesterolenrichment also occurs in LDL, IDL and HDLc (Mahley et al,
1974b). Diets very high in fats (above 50%) may additionally cause
an elevation in triglyceride (Reynolds et al, 1994) with a marked
increase in circulating LDL and other abnormalities.

231

4 - Primary hyperlipidemia

4 - Primary hyperlipidemia
Once it is verified that hyperlipidemia occurs after a 10- to 12-hour fast, and all possible causes of
secondary hyperlipidemia have been ruled out, a presumptive diagnosis of primary hyperlipidemia
is made. Primary hyperlipidemias are usually genetically determined. In the dog, several different
types of primary hyperlipidemia have been observed, including idiopathic hyperchylomicronemia, idiopathic hypercholesterolemia, and idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemia; however etiologies of
these conditions have not been well established. It is likely that with further research, many different primary syndromes with subtle differences in etiology will be identified in dogs as in
humans.

Idiopathic hyperchylomicronemia

Hyperlipidemia

A pure hyperchylomicronemia has been reported in a 28 day old mixed-breed puppy (Baum et al,
1969). This puppy was the smallest in a litter of three, was irritable and weak, with a palpably
enlarged liver. Blood had the appearance of “cream-of-tomato” soup, and after cold centrifugation, a lactescent upper layer was observed with a triglyceride concentration of 830 mg/dL, and
cholesterol concentration of 312 mg/dL. The administration of heparin sulfate did not clear the
plasma from this puppy, and a presumptive diagnosis of lipoprotein lipase deficiency was made.
There was no evidence of diabetes mellitus, but other causes of secondary hyperlipemia were not
ruled out. The puppy died of pneumonia at 33 days of age. At necropsy, the liver was enlarged,
yellow in color, with marked accumulation of lipid within hepatocytes.

Idiopathic hypercholesterolemia
In 15 clinically healthy Briards with unexplained fasting hypercholesterolemia, serum was not
hyperlipemic, and serum triglyceride concentrations were normal in all dogs (Watson et al, 1993).
Causes of secondary hyperlipidemia were ruled out. Lipoprotein electrophoresis revealed a marked increase in α2-migrating lipoproteins (HDL1) with no other abnormalities. This abnormality is unlike those reported in dogs with idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemia where serum cholesterol
and triglyceride concentrations are both increased.

© Labat

Idiopathic hypercholesterolemia has also been noted in a miniature Bull Terrier (Schenck, unpublished observation). This dog was clinically healthy with unexplained fasting hypercholesterolemia and normal serum triglyceride concentration. Serum was not hyperlipemic, and the only
abnormality seen on lipoprotein electrophoresis was an accumulation in α2-migrating lipoprotein
(HDL1).

In the Briard, idiopathic
hypercholesterolemia may be related
to the development of retinal
pigment epithelial dystrophy.

Idiopathic or primary hyperlipoproteinemia
Primary hyperlipoproteinemia with similar characteristics has been observed in a number of dog
breeds including the miniature Schnauzer, Shetland sheepdog, Beagle, miniature Poodle, Cocker
Spaniel, English Cocker Spaniel, and mixed-breed dog. Miniature Schnauzers appear to have a
higher incidence of primary hyperlipoproteinemia, however any breed of dog may be affected. Clinical signs associated with primary hyperlipoproteinemia may include abdominal pain (presumptively due to pancreatitis) and seizures (Rogers et al, 1975a), but many dogs exhibit no obvious clinical signs.
In a study of 5 miniature Schnauzers diagnosed with idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemia, all dogs had
moderately increased serum cholesterol concentrations, and moderate to marked increase in serum
triglyceride concentration (Rogers et al, 1975a). Increases in β-migrating and α2-migrating lipoproteins on lipoprotein electrophoresis were the most consistent findings. Two of 5 dogs had an
increase in chylomicrons. Injection of heparin caused shifting of lipoproteins in two dogs, but only
cleared the serum of one dog.

232

4 - Primary hyperlipidemia

In another study of 6 healthy miniature Schnauzers diagnosed with idiopathic
hyperlipoproteinemia, 4 of 6 had a history of recurrent episodes of hyperlipidemia (Whitney et al, 1993). On lipoprotein electrophoresis all 6 dogs had
increased β-migrating lipoproteins, predominantly due to an increase in VLDL
as determined by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Four of 6 had an increase
in chylomicrons at the origin.

Miniature Schnauzers appear to present
a high incidence of primary hyperlipoproteinemia, although no breed is safe.

Hyperlipidemia

Potentially two different abnormalities may exist in a study of 62 Shetland
sheepdogs with hypercholesterolemia (Sato et al, 2000). Both mean plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were increased in these dogs, though no correlation between cholesterol and triglyceride was observed. In Shetland sheepdogs with plasma cholesterol concentrations
greater than 250 mg/dL, an increase in α2-migrating lipoproteins was noted, similar to that seen
in Briards. In dogs with plasma cholesterol concentrations greater than 500 mg/dL, an increase in
β-migrating lipoprotein, mostly due to LDL was also observed. The plasma triglyceride concentration in the group of dogs with plasma cholesterol concentration greater than 500 mg/dL was
not reported.

© Hermeline

Two related Beagles with idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemia also exhibited an
increase in β-migrating and α2-migrating lipoproteins on lipoprotein electrophoresis (Wada et al, 1977). Both dogs were clinically normal, showed increased serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, and had a common sire.

In 10 clinically healthy dogs of various breeds diagnosed with primary hyperlipoproteinemia, mean
serum cholesterol concentration was 532 ± 256 mg/dL, and mean serum triglyceride concentration was 1955 ± 2193 mg/dL (Schenck, 2002). A group of healthy, non-hyperlipidemic control
dogs had mean serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations of 153 ± 17 mg/dL and 56 ±
13 mg/dL respectively. On lipoprotein electrophoresis the most consistent finding was an increase
in β-migrating lipoproteins, and percentages of chylomicrons and α2-migrating lipoproteins were
similar in both groups (Figure 9). Lipoprotein lipase activity was significantly decreased in dogs with
primary hyperlipoproteinemia, with a mean of 35±8 nmol free fatty acids released/min/mL
compared to 110 ± 10 nmol free fatty acid released/min/mL in the control dogs. Hepatic lipase
activity was significantly increased in dogs with primary hyperlipoproteinemia, with a mean of

37±10 nmol free fatty acid released/min/mL compared to 28 ± 5 nmol free fatty acid
released/min/mL in the control dogs. This study presents the first potential etiology for ‘idiopathic’ hyperlipoproteinemia. Decreased activity of lipoprotein lipase leads to decreased clearance
of VLDL and chylomicrons, and hepatic lipase may be increased in a compensatory role. A decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity in 8 miniature Schnauzers with primary hyperlipoproteinemia was
also observed in a subsequent study (Jaeger, 2003).

5 - Effects of persistent hyperlipidemia
Long-term effects of hyperlipidemia in dogs are unknown. Dogs are resistant to the development
of atherosclerosis as compared to humans, due to differences in lipoprotein metabolism between
the species (Mahley et al, 1977). For atherosclerosis to develop in the dog, serum cholesterol
concentrations greater than 750 mg/dL must be maintained for more than 6 months (Mahley et
al, 1974b).

Hyperlipidemia

Hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis
in dogs
Arteriosclerosis is often confused
with atherosclerosis.
Arteriosclerosis is a chronic
hardening of the arteries, with
loss of elasticity, and luminal
narrowing. Lipid and cholesterol
accumulation in arterial tunica

intima and tunica media is not
a feature of arteriosclerosis as
opposed to atherosclerosis.
Arteriosclerosis may be more
common in the dog, but has
not been associated with chronic
hyperlipidemia.

Atherosclerosis is a specific type of arteriosclerosis with deposition of lipid and cholesterol in arterial tunica intima and tunica
media (Liu et al, 1986). The dog has been used as an experimental
model for atherosclerosis lesions for more than 40 years, with
experimental induction of atherosclerosis resulting from hypothyroid dogs fed high levels of cholesterol, fat, taurocholic acid
and/or coconut oil (Duncan et al, 1960; Mahley et al, 1974b).
However, naturally occurring atherosclerosis in the dog has also
been reported.

> Atherosclerosis and Hypothyroidism

An association of atherosclerosis and hypothyroidism in dogs was noted over 30 years ago (Manning, 1979). In a family of Beagles, moderate to severe atherosclerosis occurred in the coronary
and renal arteries with no evidence of occlusion. Hyperlipidemia was present, even when feeding
a diet low in fat and cholesterol. Treatment of hypothyroidism with thyroxine resulted in
a decrease in serum cholesterol concentrations. However, dogs that have developed atherosclerosis do not have any regression of atherosclerotic lesions even with lowering cholesterol concentrations (DePalma et al, 1977).
Cerebrovascular atherosclerosis associated with hypothyroidism was observed in a 6 year old
Doberman pinscher (Patterson et al, 1985). This dog presented with seizures, ataxia, circling and
head tilt. At necropsy, severe generalized atherosclerosis and cerebrocortical necrosis were noted.
Necrosis was due to tissue hypoxia secondary to cerebrovascular atherosclerosis.
Twenty one cases of atherosclerosis in dogs over a 14 year period were associated with hypothyroidism (Liu et al, 1986). Clinical signs included lethargy, anorexia, weakness, dyspnea, collapse
and vomiting. Necropsy revealed myocardial fibrosis and infarction in the myocardium. Affected
arteries included coronary, myocardial, renal, carotid, thyroidal, intestinal, pancreatic, splenic,
gastric, prostatic, cerebral, and mesenteric. Arteries were thick and nodular with narrow lumens,
and walls contained foamy cells or vacuoles, and mineralized material.
> Atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus

Atherosclerosis in the canine has also been associated with diabetes mellitus (Sottiaux, 1999). A
7 year old Pomeranian initially presented with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and anterior uveitis with lipid deposition in the anterior chamber of the eye. Both hypertri234

glyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia were present, with increases in chylomicrons and β-migrating lipoproteins. One year later the dog died from ketoacidosis. Atherosclerosis was observed in
the abdominal aorta, coronary, renal, arcuate, and carotid arteries. Thyroid histology appeared
normal with no evidence of atrophy.
Thirty dogs with atherosclerosis confirmed at necropsy were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, or hyperadrenocorticism (Hess et al, 2003). Dogs with
atherosclerosis were 53 times more likely to have diabetes mellitus, and 51 times more likely to
have hypothyroidism compared to dogs without atherosclerosis. An increased incidence of hyperadrenocorticism was not noted in dogs with atherosclerosis.

Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in dogs
Recently, apoprotein B100 has been localized to the accumulation of lipids seen in the splenic arteries of aged dogs (Sako et al, 2001). Chlamydial antigens have also been noted in canine atherosclerotic lesions (Sako et al, 2002), and the Chlamydial organism may play a role in the pathogenesis of canine atherosclerosis. The ratio of apoprotein B100 to apoprotein A-I is increased in dogs
with systemic atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia, and this ratio could be important in the diagnosis of atherosclerosis in dogs (Miyoshi et al, 2000).

Hyperlipidemia and pancreatitis in dogs
There is also evidence that persistent hyperlipidemia may lead to pancreatitis (Dominguez-Munoz
et al, 1991), and pancreatitis often occurs in humans with familial hyperchylomicronemia (Heaney
et al, 1999). A burst of free radical activity in pancreatic acinar cells disrupts glutathione homeostasis and may be the initiating event in pancreatitis (Guyan et al, 1990). Increased free radical activity may relate to pancreatic ischemia resulting from sluggish pancreatic microcirculation due to

high concentrations of chylomicrons (Sanfey et al, 1984). Free radical damage causes leakage of
lipase into the pancreatic microcirculation. Lipase causes hydrolysis of triglyceride present in excess
chylomicrons or VLDL resulting in release of free fatty acids which are intensely inflammatory. Free
fatty acids can also cause activation of Hageman factor, or may bind calcium leading to microthrombi and capillary damage. Phospholipid present in chylomicrons and VLDL are also susceptible to free radical attack leading to lipid peroxidation, intensifying inflammation. This results in
an increase in release of pancreatic lipase and further lipolysis, leading to pancreatitis (Havel, 1969).

Hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus in dogs

Hyperlipidemia

Persistent hyperlipidemia may also cause diabetes mellitus (Sane et al, 1993). Increased triglyceride and free fatty acids may lead to insulin resistance due to inhibition of glucose oxidation and
glycogen synthesis (Boden, 1997). Free fatty acids may stimulate glyconeogenesis which contributes to inappropriate glucose production (Rebrin et al, 1995). Increased free fatty acids early on
act to stimulate insulin production even with low glucose concentrations. In the long term, increased free fatty acids modulate β-cell gene expression and inhibit insulin secretion (Prentki et al,
1996). By multiple mechanisms, increased serum triglyceride and free fatty acids can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. If hyperlipidemia is corrected, diabetes mellitus caused by hyperlipidemia can be reversed (Mingrone et al, 1999).
The effects of persistent hyperlipidemia in the canine on other organ systems have not been studied. In rats with nephrotic syndrome, persistent hyperlipidemia contributes to progressive renal
injury (Hirano et al, 1992), and progression of renal dysfunction correlates to serum cholesterol
concentration (Washio et al, 1996).

6 - Treatment of hyperlipidemia
Caution must be exercised when
considering dietary fat content on
only a percentage basis. For example,
a diet containing 10% fat with an
ME of 4000 kcal/kg provides only
25 g fat/1000 kcal, whereas a diet
containing 8% fat with an ME
of 2700 kcal/kg provides 30 g
fat/1000 kcal.

Because of the potential risks associated with persistent hyperlipidemia, hyperlipidemia should
be treated aggressively. The underlying disorder in secondary hyperlipidemias should be treated,
but there is no specific therapeutic regimen for dogs with idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemias.
Unfortunately since little is known regarding the mechanisms of primary hyperlipidemia, and
multiple syndromes most likely exist, no single treatment regimen has been effective in all cases.

Nutritional treatment of hyperlipidemia
> A fat-restricted diet

Initial treatment of primary hyperlipidemia involves a switch to a low-fat diet (<25 g/1000 kcal)
with moderate protein content (generally greater than 18%, or 60 g protein/1000 kcal). Diets low
in protein may cause an increase in serum cholesterol concentration (Polzin et al, 1983; Hansen
et al, 1992) and are therefore not recommended unless the presence of other conditions warrant
their use. Numerous nutritionally complete, low-fat canine diets are commercially available, but
one must be careful to choose a diet that is low in fat based on a metabolizable energy (ME), and
not strictly on the percent fat present in the diet. Most diets with a fat content less than 8% will
provide less than 25g fat/1000 kcal. However, some diets appear low in fat on a percentage basis
(<8%), but actually provide substantially more than 25 g fat/1000 kcal when the amount of fiber
in the diet and metabolizable energy are taken into account, and thus are not low-fat diets.
After feeding a low-fat diet for 6 to 8 weeks, the presence of hyperlipidemia should be re-evaluated. Low-fat diets alone may not cause resolution of hyperlipidemia, especially when there is a
high concentration of endogenous triglyceride (VLDL-TG) (Bauer, 1995).

236

6 - Treatment of hyperlipidemia

> Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation

If hyperlipidemia is still present after 6 to 8 weeks, then fish oil at a dose of 220 mg/ kg of body
weight (BW) once daily should be added to the treatment regimen. Fish oil capsules may be obtained over-the-counter, but labels should be read carefully to ensure that the dog receives 220 mg/kg
BW of a combination of alpha-linolenic acid, and the long chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Some products claim to be ‘omega-3 supplements,’ but contain a high percentage of other non-omega-3 fatty acids.

Hyperlipidemia

In the author’s experience the only side effect noted with this level of fish oil supplementation is
that the dog may have a noticeable ‘fishy’ odor which may be objectionable to some owners. If
hyperlipidemia resolves with this level of fish oil supplementation and the owner complains about
the fishy odor, a half-dose (110 mg fish oil/kg BW/day) can be evaluated. A few dogs can be managed at this dose; however, most will require a minimum of 170 mg fish oil/kg BW/day to maintain
the absence of hyperlipidemia. In one particular case in the author’s experience, a 6 year-old Shetland Sheepdog with idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemia and multiple lipomas showed complete resolution of serum hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia after 4 weeks on
a low-fat diet and 220 mg fish oil/kg BW/day. In addition, most of the lipomas resolved. Due to
the dog’s fishy odor, the dosage of fish oil was dropped to 110 mg/kg BW/day, with a return of
hyperlipidemia. A dosage of 170 mg fish oil/kg BW/day in combination with a low-fat diet has
maintained the absence of hyperlipidemia for over one year.
The use of fish oil and EPA & DHA in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis has
been extensively studied in a number of species.
- EPA supplementation resulted in a 31% decrease in serum triglyceride in human patients (Okumura et al, 2002).
- Rats fed diets containing EPA and DHA exhibited a decrease in serum cholesterol and triglyceride and the development of atherosclerosis was prevented (Adan et al, 1999).
- Fish oil supplementation decreased serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, VLDL-triglyceride and
VLDL-cholesterol in chicks (Castillo et al, 2000).
- In dogs with renal insufficiency, fish oil supplementation resulted in a decrease in serum cholesterol concentration (Brown et al, 2000).
- Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemia (WHHL) rabbits exhibited a decrease in serum triglyceride
and cholesterol with a decrease in VLDL-triglyceride (Mortensen et al, 1998).

FISH OIL AND OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS

Synthesis of triglyceride and VLDL in the liver is decreased by omega-3 fatty acids (Harris et al,
1990; Connor et al, 1993), and the effectiveness of fish oils in dogs with hyperlipidemia suggests
that the hypertriglyceridemia may be partly due to overproduction of VLDL (Bauer, 1995).

237

6 - Treatment of hyperlipidemia

Fish oils may exert a beneficial effect on hyperlipidemia by stimulating lipoprotein lipase activity
(Levy et al, 1993), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose and lipid (Thomson et al, 1993),
increasing cholesterol secretion into bile (Smit et al, 1991) and by decreasing cholesterol absorption (Thompson et al, 1989). Fish oils also decrease serum concentration of free fatty acids (Singer
et al, 1990) which may be important in the prevention of pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus. Development of atherosclerosis may be prevented by fish oil due to an inhibition of mitogen-induced
smooth muscle cell proliferation (Pakala et al, 2000).
Unfortunately there are no long-term studies to verify the safety and efficacy of any lipid-lowering agent in dogs, and any therapy should be used with caution. One concern with fish oil therapy is that fish oil increases the concentration of lipoperoxides in LDL (Puiggros et al, 2002). The
addition of vitamin E to the fish oil therapy regimen may enhance beneficial effects by increasing
glutathione reductase activity and decreasing peroxide levels (Hsu et al, 2001).
In severe cases of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in human patients, fish oil and other dietary therapies result in some improvement, but serum lipids may remain elevated (Richter et al, 1992).
> Interest of medium chain triglycerides

Hyperlipidemia

In human patients, in addition to fish oil therapy, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) in combination with low-fat diets cause a decrease in hypertriglyceridemia (Rouis et al, 1997; Chou et al,
2002; Nagasaka et al, 2003). MCT administration results in increased lipoprotein lipase activity
(Shirai et al, 1992) and may prevent hyperlipidemia associated pancreatitis (Mizushima et al, 1998).
MCT administration does not lower, and may even elevate serum cholesterol concentration (Asakura et al, 2000). Therefore, MCT therapy should only be used in cases where there is elevation
of serum triglyceride concentration without a high elevation in serum cholesterol. Unfortunately, MCT oil is not very palatable, limiting its use.
> Fermentable fiber intake

The presence of a blend of fructooligosaccharides and beet pulp in the diet may also be desirable,
since this blend can decrease serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations in the dog (Diez
et al, 1997).
> Antioxidant treatment

Since the pathogenesis for idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemia has been at least partly determined
(Schenck, 2002), treatments that have been effective in human patients with lipoprotein lipase
deficiency may be worthy of investigation.
Several humans with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency treated with a combination of oral
antioxidant therapy (OAT) showed prevention of recurrent pancreatitis even though there was
no effect on circulating lipids (Heaney et al, 1999). Antioxidant therapy consisted of a combination of α-tocopherol, β-carotene, vitamin C, selenium, and methionine.

Medical treatment of hyperlipidemia
Other treatment regimens have been attempted with variable results.
Gemfibrozil has been used to stimulate lipoprotein lipase activity and decrease VLDL secretion
(Santamarina-Fojo et al, 1994).
Niacin therapy has also been used in a few dogs; however, adverse effects have been noted in both
dogs (Bauer, 1995), and humans (Kashyap et al, 2002).

238

Conclusion

Dextrothyroxine administration significantly decreased serum lipids in dogs with induced hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis (Nandan et al, 1975), though these effects may have been due to
contamination of dextrothyroxine with L-thyroxine (Young et al, 1984). Dextrothyroxine administration in humans results in an approximately 18% decrease in serum total cholesterol (Brun
et al, 1980), but is not vastly utilized as a treatment for hyperlipidemia due to a concurrent lowering of HDL cholesterol (Bantle et al, 1984). A major mechanism of cholesterol-lowering by thyroxine in humans is an increase in cholesteryl ester transfer protein (Berti et al, 2001); however,
since dogs have little cholesteryl ester transfer protein, thyroxine may not be as effective. Thyroxine does have other lipid-lowering mechanisms, including an increase in hepatic lipase activity and increased conversion of IDL to LDL (Asami et al, 1999), and is effective in lowering lipid
concentrations in hypothyroid dogs (Rogers et al, 1975b; Cortese et al, 1997). Since thyroxine is
fairly well tolerated in the dog, an investigation of lipid-lowering properties in euthyroid dogs with
primary hyperlipoproteinemia may be warranted.
Gene therapy has been effective in mice (Zsigmond et al, 1997) and may become a clinical reality in the future for patients with severe dyslipidemias (Rader et al, 1999).

Conclusion
Many conditions may cause hyperlipidemia in the dog. Postprandial hyperlipidemia should always
be verified, and secondary causes of hyperlipidemia must be ruled out before a diagnosis of primary
hyperlipidemia can be made. Hyperlipidemias are characterized by a number of different changes
in lipoprotein concentrations, depending on cause (Table 5). Treatment of the underlying cause
of hyperlipidemia is usually effective at resolving the secondary hyperlipidemia. Primary hyperlipidemias should be aggressively treated because of the potential complications of persistent hyperlipidemia.

Hyperlipidemia

TABLE 5 - LIPOPROTEIN CHANGES IN CANINE HYPERLIPIDEMIAS

Q

A

What causes serum to be turbid?

Elevated serum triglyceride carried by lipoproteins causes serum to appear turbid.
Opacity is seen when triglyceride concentration approaches 600 mg/dL. Serum may
have the appearance of whole milk when triglyceride concentrations reach 25004000 mg/dL.

What conditions cause
hyperlipidemia?

The most common cause is a non-fasted animal. If fasting for greater than 12 hours is confirmed, then primary hyperlipidemia, or secondary hyperlipidemia due to hypothyroidism, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, cholestasis, or nephrotic syndrome may be
present.

Is primary hyperlipoproteinemia
hereditary?

Since hyperlipoproteinemias appear to be more common in certain breeds, some defects in
lipid metabolism may be hereditary. However, it is likely that primary hyperlipoproteinemia
may represent a number of different lipid metabolic defects which may or may not be hereditary in nature.

Are high fat diets harmful
to dogs?

Not usually. Lipid metabolism in dogs is very different from that in humans. Dogs carry most
of their cholesterol in HDL, and are very resistant to the development of atherosclerosis.
However, if certain other diseases are present such as hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus, high
fat diets could result in further lipid abnormalities.

What causes a ‘cream layer’
to separate in some turbid
serum samples?

The ‘cream layer’ which floats to the top of serum is due to the presence of chylomicrons. This is normal in a non-fasted animal, but represents an abnormality if the animal has been fasted for greater than 12 hours.

Do dogs develop
atherosclerosis?

Unlike humans, dogs rarely develop atherosclerosis due to differences in lipid metabolism.
Atherosclerosis may develop in some dogs that have another concurrent disease that causes
chronic hyperlipidemia.

Should persistent fasting
hyperlipidemia be treated

Yes. If the hyperlipidemia is due to a secondary cause, then treatment of the underlying condition may resolve the hyperlipidemia. There is evidence suggesting that chronic hyperlipidemia may lead to the development of pancreatitis, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, or atherosclerosis in some dogs.

Key Points
- Restrict fat to combat hyperlipidemia and any
obesity
- Ensure low fiber content and high digestibility
to promote the good absorption of essential nutrients

*The diet is offered in accordance with the dog’s healthy weight. In obese dogs, the diet must be prescribed in accordance
with the ideal weight and not the real weight of the dog.
**Dividing the daily amount over two or three meals is recommended to promote good digestion.

Hyperlipidemia

© Renner

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

The Collie (and the German Shepherd) may suffer primary disorders of lipoprotein metabolism, leading to hypercholesterolemia.
The disease may lead to corneal lipidosis where the cholesterol and phospholipid vacuoles are present
in the superficial stroma of the cornea.

Key Points
to remember:

In the nutritional management of hyperlipidemia
• Achieve weight loss in the dog if
the body condition demands it.
There is a correlation between obesity and the plasma indicators of
hyperlipidemia (lipoproteins, leptin,
insulin and ghrelin) (Jeusette et al,
2005).
• Give the dog a low-fat diet:
< 25 g/1000 kcal, or less than 9% fat
in a 3500 kcal/kg diet. Controlling
the energy ingested is the best way
of controlling hyperlipidemia in
obese dogs.
• During the low fat diet, simply
controlling the hyperlipidemia is not

enough. It may be necessary to prescribe a fish oil supplement (220 mg/kg)
to provide EPA and DHA (long-chain
omega 3 fatty acids), which have a
lipopenic action.
• High levels of poly-unsaturated
omega-3 fatty acids may increase the
risk of oxidation of lipid membranes.
The administration of biological
antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E, vitamin
C and beta-carotene) may be necessary to prevent oxidative reactions.
• Supplementation with fermentable
fiber in association with a low-calorie
diet may help to regress corneal lipi-

dosis. In practice, this supplementation can be achieved by the inclusion
of 1-2% fructo-oligosaccharides
(FOS) or the gradual addition of guar
gum in the same proportions (Jeusette
et al, 2004). Interestingly, the effect of
the FOS on hypercholesterolemia is
in consistent.
• The patient should be re-evaluated
every month for the first three
months. Once the hyperlipidemia
has been controlled re-evaluation
every six months will be sufficient.

In the omega 3 fatty acid family the first double bond is between the third and fourth carbon atom.

The synthesis of long-chain fatty

atoms and the unsaturated double

that act in the synthesis of omega 3
and omega 6, which is the reason for

competition between the two families.

C

hronic renal failure (CRF) ensues from the irreversible loss
of the metabolic, endocrine and excretory capacities of the
kidney. It is a common clinical problem occurring in 2-5% of dogs
(Bronson, 1982; Lund et al, 1999). Chronic renal failure is considered a
leading cause of death in older patients (Figure 1). The 1997
Morris Animal Foundation Animal Health Survey of 2,000 pet
owners identified kidney disease as the third leading cause of
death in dogs. The mean age of diagnosis in dogs is 6.5 years,
with 45% of cases reported over 10 years of age (Polzin, 1989; Polzin
et al 2000). The onset of renal failure tends to be insidious as renal
function generally declines over a period of months to years.
The uremic syndrome manifests when the residual renal mass
is generally less than 25% of normal and compensatory changes
fail to meet the metabolic and excretory needs of the body
for homeostasis.

Kidneys

Chronic renal failure is caused by replacement of functional nephrons by non-functional scar
tissue and inflammatory infiltrates. The precise etiology is however multifactorial: it may be congenital or familial in origin or occur secondary to acquired disease processes that injure the renal
glomeruli, tubules, interstitium or vasculature (Table 1). Damage to the glomeruli, tubules, interstitium or vasculature results in entire nephron destruction with ultimate replacement by fibrous
scar tissue (Figure 2).

1 - Classification and etiology

2 - Pathophysiology

2 - Pathophysiology
Most of the nephrons of the diseased kidney fall into one of two categories. They are either nonfunctioning nephrons, as a result of destruction of any portion of their structures, or they are intact
nephrons that function normally. Changes in renal function occur as a result of a reduction in the
number of functioning nephrons. As the number of functioning nephrons diminishes, there are
adaptations that occur in a regular sequence. When nephrons are damaged and essentially rendered non functional, the remaining “healthy” nephrons increase their size and their work load
to compensate for nephron loss. This is referred to as the hyperfiltration theory (Figure 3).
Nephron hypertrophy and hyperfiltration is an adaptative mechanism to compensate for reduced
nephron number.
Nevertheless the chronic increase in glomerular capillary pressure and/or glomerular plasma flow
rate damages the endothelium, mesangium and epithelium. Mesangial matrix production, glomerular deposition of circulating lipid, and capillary thrombosis promote structural injury to the glomerulus. Tubulointerstitial damage, increased tubular ammoniagenesis, and soft tissue mineralization contribute to nephron injury and ultimately lead to nephron sclerosis. Continued nephron
destruction initiates further compensation, promoting a self-perpetuating cycle of adaptation and
injuries (Figure 4).

Kidneys

The progression of CRF has been described as occurring in four stages that are not sharply demarcated but rather, are phases in a continuing degenerative process with loss of more and more functioning nephrons (Table 2).

Increase in single nephron glomerular filtration rate is mainly due to the vasoconstricting
action of angiotensin II on the efferent arteriole, which consequently increases the filtration
pressure. This leads to an increased glomerular capillary plasma flow and increased
trans-capillary hydraulic pressure so that more plasma is filtered by each surviving nephron.

254

The compensatory changes maintain clinically stable
disease until structural and functional damage exceeds
a threshold beyond which progression of renal function
and clinical signs of uremia occur. Chronic renal disease
typically progresses to end-stage renal disease after a
critical number of nephrons have been damaged.

Given the large reserve capacity of the kidney at least 60-70% of normal renal function must be
lost before azotemia increases, although there may be some nephron hypertrophy during the first
phase of decreased renal reserve. At this stage, the patient does not have any clinical symptoms
although decreased urine concentrating ability may be noted. In renal insufficiency, up to 75% of
the nephrons may be lost. There is mild azotemia, loss of urine concentrating ability and the
patient becomes more susceptible to the effects of stresses such as large changes in fluid intake,
protein and electrolytes. The patient may remain symptom-free if no overwhelming metabolic
stress occurs.

The four phases are:
(1) decreased renal reserve,
(2) renal insufficiency
(3) renal failure
(4) uremic syndrome.

The pathogenesis of the uremic syndrome is complex and not fully
understood. Many toxins are involved and no single compound is
likely to explain the diversity of the uremic symptoms. Nitrogenous
waste products of protein digestion and catabolism (e.g. urea, creatinine, ammonia, middle molecules, guanidine and its derivatives)
accumulate when renal function is reduced and some of them contribute to many of the clinical consequences of uremic intoxication
associate with chronic renal failure (Table 3).

Kidneys

In renal failure nephron loss may reach 90%. There is moderate to severe azotemia, anemia,
decreased urine concentration ability and impaired ability to maintain electrolyte and acid base
balance.

Gastrointestinal consequences
Gastrointestinal intoxications including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fetid breath, stomatitis, oral
ulcerations (Figure 5), tongue tip necrosis, gastritis, gastrointestinal ulcers, hematemesis, enterocolitis, diarrhea, intussusception and ileus are the most common and prominent clinical signs of
uremia. These lesions and dysfunctions act singularly or in concert to induce gastrointestinal
pathology.
Excess urea secreted in salivary and gastric juices is converted by urease producing
bacteria to ammonia that directly damages the mucosa. Uremic toxins also injure the
gastric mucus, mucosa, submucosa or vasculature, thereby reducing the protection
afforded by the gastric mucosal barrier. Reduced renal clearance of gastrin leads to
hypergastrinemia and stimulation of gastric acid production.

Figure 5 - Oral lesions in uremic
stomatitis/gingivitis

Increased diffusion of acid into the gastric wall induces inflammation, ulceration, and
hemorrhage, in addition to perpetuating uremic toxin induced gastric injury. Vomiting occurs secondary to gastritis in addition to the direct effect of uremic toxins on
the chemoreceptor trigger zone.

255

The two major neurologic complications of uremia are uremic encephalopathy and
neuropathy. Uremic encephalopathy is a term that reflects diffuse and non specific alterations of the cerebral cortex. The severity and progression of the neurological signs is
generally correlated with the magnitude and progression of the azotemia. Typical signs
include a progressive decline in alertness and awareness, dullness, lethargy, impaired
mentation, altered behavior, confusion, stupor, tremors, ataxia, muscular cramps,
fatigue, muscle weakness, seizures and coma. The neurological signs are due to the
effects of uremic toxins, hyperparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia and hypertension.

3 - Clinical consequences of uremia

Neuromuscular consequences

Kidneys

The Doppler technique and oscillometry are very common methods for
detecting hypertension. Doppler is the
recommended technique for cats.
The oscillometric measurements in dogs
can be unreliable due to differences
in conformation, obesity or a thick
coat (Stepien, 2001). The animal’s
adaptation to the environment is
critical to the interpretation of arterial
pressure measurements, as stress can
induce erroneous results. Six to ten
measurements are recommended.

Cardiopulmonary consequences
Cardiopulmonary complications include hypertension, uremic cardiomyopathy, uremic pericarditis, pulmonary edema and uremic pneumonitis. Abnormalities in fluid, electrolyte and acid base
balance may contribute to alterations in cardiac contractility and excitability. Azotemia and overhydration play a role in pericarditis, uremic cardiomyopathy and pulmonary edema. Hypertension
arises secondary to a combination of activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system,
sodium retention, plasma volume expansion, activation of the sympathetic nervous system,
decreased activity of vasodilatory substances, increased cardiac output, increased total peripheral
vascular resistance and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Systemic hypertension predominately targets the kidneys (glomerulosclerosis), heart (left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial ischemia),
eyes (retinal detachment, hyphema, retinal hemorrhage) and brain (hypertensive encephalopathy, dementia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage). Uremic pneumonitis refers to the formation of a high
protein pulmonary edema which is presumably a consequence of uremic toxins damaging alveoli
and increasing capillary permeability.

Ocular consequences
Common manifestations of advanced uremia include scleral and conjunctival injection and ocular pathology secondary to systemic hypertension. Opthalmoscopic findings include reduced pupillary light reflexes, papilledema, retinal arterial tortuosity, retinal hemorrhage, retinal detachment,
hyphema, anterior uveitis and glaucoma. Ischemia and retinal degeneration result from sustained
retinal arteriolar vasoconstriction which is an attempt to auto-regulate local blood flow in the face
of sustained chronic hypertension.

Metabolic and endocrine consequences
The kidney is responsible for the degradation of many peptide hormones and loss of this catabolic function can result in metabolic derangements caused by hormone excess. Deranged insulin
metabolism may also contribute to hyperlipidemia. Other hormonal alterations include increased
concentrations of gastrin, glucagon, growth hormone, prolactin and luteinizing hormone. Serum
T4 concentrations are low and there is impairment in the conversion of T4 to T3 (euthyroid sick
syndrome).

Fluid, electrolyte and acid-base consequences
Metabolic acidosis is a frequent finding in renal disease and results primarily from the inability of
the kidney to excrete hydrogen ions and regenerate bicarbonate. Chronic acidosis causes progressive bone demineralization, urinary calcium loss, hypokalemia and increases skeletal muscle
protein catabolism which exacerbates azotemia.
Hyperphosphatemia is one of the most common regulatory derangements of CRF that arises secondary to reduced glomerular filtration of phosphorus. Hyperphosphatemia contributes to renal
secondary hyperparathyroidism (see below), reduced calcitriol levels, soft tissue calcification, renal
256

3 - Clinical consequences of uremia

osteodystrophy and hypocalcemia. Soft tissue mineralization develops as the calcium x phosphate
product exceeds 60 (concentrations are expressed in mg/dL).The most commonly targeted organs
include the gastric mucosa, bronchial walls, myocardium, endocardium, renal interstitium,
glomeruli, lungs, and intercostal muscles. Renal mineralization will promote interstitial inflammation, fibrosis and progression of renal failure.
Hypokalemia is a common abnormality associated with chronic renal failure. The mechanism is
unclear and includes excessive urinary potassium loss, inadequate dietary potassium intake, and
acidifying diets. Hypokalemia causes generalized muscle weakness and pain which may present as
cervical ventroflexion and a stiff, stilted gait. Hypokalemia also impairs protein synthesis, promotes weight loss, a poor hair coat and contributes to polyuria by decreasing the renal responsiveness to ADH. Chronic potassium depletion may indeed impair renal function by inducing a
reversible, functional decline in GFR in addition to promoting renal injury by enhancing ammoniagenesis.

Renal secondary hyperparathyroidism
Renal secondary hyperparathyroidism is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by increased
secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH secretion is stimulated by hypocalcemia and
decreased plasma calcitriol concentrations. Hypocalcemia is a mass action (i.e. calcium x phosphate remains constant) consequence of renal retention of phosphate.

Kidneys

Calcitriol production is regulated at the level of the 1-α-hydroxylase enzyme in the kidney. Phosphate in excess and loss of functional renal mass result in a decrease in 1-α-hydroxylase activity
and reduces the conversion of 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol).
Calcitriol deficiency reduces the intestinal absorption of calcium, reduces the release of calcium
and phosphate from bone, reduces renal reabsorption of calcium and phosphate and increases the
synthesis and release of PTH (Figures 6A and 6B).

Initially the increased PTH concentration activates the remaining 1-alpha hydroxylase enzyme
with a compensatory increased in calcitriol concentrations. However, with disease progression stimulation of 1-α-hydroxylase becomes ineffectual and calcitriol concentrations remain low. Complications of renal secondary hyperparathyroidism include osteodystrophy, soft tissue calcification,
skeletal decalcification, cystic bone lesions, bone pain and growth retardation. Osteodystrophy
most commonly occurs in immature patients and is recognized by demineralization of the bones.
The teeth become movable and the jaw can be bent or twisted without fracturing (rubber jaw).
Facial distortion may occur secondary to connective tissue proliferation. PTH has also been implicated as a uremic toxin and may contribute to the progression of renal failure.

Hematologic consequences

© J-C Meauxsoone

Normocytic normochromic non-regenerative anemia is the most common abnormality in uremia.
The pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes inadequate production of erythropoietin by the
diseased kidneys, reduced life span of red cells, nutritional deficiencies, uremic toxin induced inhibition of erythropoiesis and blood loss with consequent iron deficiency. Anemia will contribute
to the clinical signs of lethargy and inappetance. Neutrophil function and cell mediated immunity is impaired in uremia, predisposing the uremic patient to infection. The specific causes of
renal failure associated immunocompromise is not completely understood, although malnutrition,
uremic toxins, PTH and vitamin D concentrations may be involved.

Hemostatic consequences
The hydration state is evaluated by
clinical examination, the measurement
of hematocrit and total
plasma proteins.

258

Uremia is characterized by abnormal hemostasis manifested as petechiae, ecchymoses, bruising,
bleeding from gum margins or venipuncture sites, epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding. The
major hemostatic abnormality is a qualitative defect in platelet function which is manifest by prolongation of the bleeding time (indirectly allows evaluation of vascular contractility, platelet numbers, platelet function, and factor VIII complex function).

4 - Clinical presentation

4 - Clinical presentation
The onset and spectrum of clinical and pathological events occurring in patients with CRF will
vary depending on the nature, severity, duration and rate of progression of the renal disease in
addition to the presence or absence of coexisting disease. Historical findings include anorexia,
depression, weakness, lethargy, weight loss, halitosis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, polyuria
and polydipsia. Pale mucous membranes, dehydration, hypothermia, stomatitis, oral ulceration,
dull dry hair coat and poor body condition may be noted on physical examination. Abdominal
palpation reveals small irregular kidneys. Congenital and familial causes of CRF should be suspected on the basis of breed, family history, and age of onset of the renal disease (Table 1). Some
patients will present with polydipsia/polyuria as the only historical sign, while other patients may
be recognized by isothenuria noted on routine geriatric or pre-anesthetic laboratory screening.

TABLE 4 - LABORATORY FINDINGS
IN CRF

Laboratory findings consistent with renal failure include azotemia (increase in BUN,
creatinine), hyperphosphatemia, mild to severe metabolic acidosis, hypo or hyperkalemia, hypo or hypercalcemia, anemia, hyperlipidemia, bleeding tendencies, isothenuria, proteinuria and hypertension (Table 4). These biological signs are not necessarily present in a single dog.

Azotemia
The identification of azotemia requires
delineation of pre-renal azotemia, prerenal azotemia complicating chronic
renal failure, acute renal failure, acute
renal failure complicating chronic renal
failure, post renal azotemia and post
renal azotemia complicating chronic
renal failure from uncomplicated chronic end-stage renal disease. Each of these
disparate azotemic conditions may
appear clinically quite similar, but rapid
identification is required to formulate a
therapeutic plan and guide prognosis
(Figure 7).

Proteinuria
Dogs with CRF may or may not have
proteinuria. Urine strip or stick tests
used to screen for proteinuria detect
mainly albumin (lower limit of detection
~50 mg/L) and not globulin. False positive results can occur if samples are very
alkaline or contaminated by quaternary
ammonium compounds.

A thorough initial evaluation including complete blood count (CBC), biochemical
profile, urine analysis, urine culture and blood pressure measurement is indicated to
plan the appropriate conservative management. Abdominal radiographs and or abdominal ultrasound will complement the initial laboratory data base.

The diagnosis of chronic renal failure is relatively straightforward. It is,
however, more difficult to identify early renal disease prior to the development
of clinical signs or laboratory abnormalities.

5 - Diagnostic evaluation

2+ proteinuria represents a more substantial protein loss if urine is dilute (USG 1.010) than if it
is 4 times more concentrated (USG 1.040) (Figure 8). The same principle lies behind
use of urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) to evaluate severity of proteinuria.

© J-C Meauxsoone

Sustained, severe proteinuria (typically 3 or 4+) strongly suggests glomerular damage,
but only if hematuria and urinogenital inflammation are excluded by the absence of
erythrocytes and leukocytes in urine sediment. If glomerular protein loss is suspected,
proteinuria should be confirmed using the semiquantitative sulphosalicylic acid turbidometric test, which is simple enough to do in the practice laboratory, or urine protein should be quantified by a more precise method in an external laboratory. Not all
proteinurias are pathological and pathological proteinurias can arise from non-renal
lesions, so caution is advisable before attributing proteinuria to renal disease.

The semi quantitative results from dipstick
tests must also be compared with the urinary
concentration.

Microalbuminuria
Microalbuminuria (i.e. urine albumin concentration < 1 mg/dL) has been suggested to
be an early indicator of renal disease. However, recent studies have suggested that 56%
of dogs that are microalbuminuric have systemic inflammatory, infectious or neoplastic disease. Therefore, the specificity of microalbuminuria for the
diagnosis of early renal disease is not fully known.

FIGURE 8 - INTERPRETATION OF PROTEINURIA BASED
ON URINARY DENSITY

The best indicator of renal function is the glomerular filtration rate
(GFR). GFR is assessed by calculating the clearance of a solute by
the kidney. Urinary inulin clearance is considered the gold standard
reference method for measuring GFR. Unfortunately the technique
of inulin clearance is labor intensive and best utilized in a research
setting. The plasma exogenous creatinine clearance test (PECCT)
involves a single injection of creatinine with timed plasma samples
to detect plasma clearance of creatinine (Figure 9). The test has
been validated in the dog and provides a clinically useful tool to
assess renal function (Watson & al, 2002).

6 - Treatment
Tailored supportive medical therapy has been the mainstay of
management for chronic renal failure for decades. The goals of
medical management are to:
(1) reduce the renal work load
(2) alleviate the clinical signs and biological consequences of the
uremic intoxications
(3) minimize disturbances in fluid, electrolyte, vitamin, mineral
and acid base balance
(4) slow progression of the disease.

Therapy should not necessarily be expected to reverse or eliminate the renal lesions responsible
for the CRF. However, when CRF progresses due to an evolving disease (pyelonephritis, chronic
urinary obstruction, nephrolithiasis, renal lymphoma, some immune-mediated diseases), rapid
identification and appropriate treatment of the disorder may halt or slow progression of the renal
disease.
Chronic renal failure is progressive and dynamic, hence, serial clinical and laboratory assessment
of the patient and modification of the therapy in response to changes in the patient’s condition

Many renal failure patients are exquisitely sensitive to the gastrointestinal side-effects of prescribed drugs. The clinician also needs to consider
the potential adverse effects of “poly pharmacy” and drug interactions.
Furthermore, many medications undergo renal excretion and the
dosages will need to be modified to account for delayed clearance and
the longer half life the drug. Ideally dosage adjustments should be made
according to changes in drug clearance which may be estimated by measuring creatinine clearance. The drug dose is then adjusted according to
the percent reduction in creatinine clearance (i.e. the ratio of the
patients’ creatinine clearance to normal creatinine clearance). For
example if the normal dose is 10 mg/kg q 8 hrs and the creatinine clearance is 25% of normal, the dose should be altered to 2.5 mg/kg q 8 hrs
or 10 mg/kg q 32 hours. For the owner’s compliance, decreasing the dose
is often better accepted than stretching the administration interval
(although it might be necessary for specific drugs, i.e. concentrationdependent antibiotics). The dosage regimen should be adjusted for drugs
mainly excreted (>80%) unchanged by the kidney, and for drugs which
are not totally excreted by the kidney and have a low therapeutic index.
e.g.:
- Gentamicin: renal excretion and low therapeutic index; prescription
not recommended but sometimes necessary in case of multiresistant
infections
- Carboplatin: antineoplastic agent with a very low therapeutic index
and renal excretion.

is integral to successful therapy. Select therapeutic agents used in the
management of chronic renal failure are listed in Table 5.

Although the relationship between serum creatinine concentration and
creatinine clearance is not linear, creatinine clearance evolution can be
estimated by the modifications of the serum creatinine concentration
measured in standardized conditions for stages I and II of CRF.

Treatment of anemia encompasses administration of androgens, blood
transfusions or erythropoietin replacement therapy with recombinant
human erythropoietin. In addition, every attempt should be made to
minimize blood loss by venipuncture, gastrointestinal ulcerations, gastrointestinal parasites and uremic bleeding. Androgen therapy is not parRecommendations regarding dietary therapy and other

when rapid correction of the anemia is required prior to anesthesia or
surgery. Repeated transfusions have been used to support the anemia of chronic renal failure but
they are not recommended due to the increased risk of transfusion reaction.
Effective erythropoiesis is readily obtained by the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (Cowgill et al, 1995; 1998). A dose dependent response in hematocrit can be seen within
the first week of therapy, however 2 to 8 weeks of therapy is generally required to normalize the
hematocrit. Erythropoietin therapy is initiated at 100 U/kg subcutaneously three times weekly
with weekly monitoring of the hematocrit. Once the hematocrit is 35-40%, the dosing interval is
decreased to twice weekly therapy. The lowest dose/frequency that maintains the hematocrit in
the normal range should be identified by monitoring the hematocrit. Side effects of erythropoietin therapy include polycythemia, vomiting, seizures, pain at the injection site, fever and hypertension.

6 - Treatment

Some dogs will develop erythropoietin antibodies that effectively neutralize endogenous and exogenous erythropoietin. These patients are identified by either refractory anemia or the development of anemia weeks to months following institution of therapy. Diagnosis requires elimination
of other causes of anemia and bone marrow assessment of myeloid to erythroid ratios (M:E ratio
> 10). Treatment requires cessation of recombinant erythropoietin therapy. After therapy is stopped, the antibody concentrations will decline and the pretreatment levels of endogenous erythropoietin and hematocrit will be obtained. Blood transfusions may be required until the hematocrit stabilizes. The future availability of canine recombinant erythropoietin will eliminate the
development of antibodies to human recombinant erythropoietin (Randolph et al, 2004).
A risk-benefit assessment is necessary prior to institution of human recombinant erythropoietin.
Erythropoietin therapy is generally recommended when the packed cell volume is less than 25%.
At this stage, the benefits of improved clinical status with increases in appetite, body weight, energy level and sociability appear to out weigh the risks of antibody formation. Iron deficiency secondary to gastrointestinal blood loss generally accompanies CRF. Iron status can be assessed by serum
iron, transferrin, ferritin, or total iron binding capacity (TIBC). Oral supplementation with iron
sulfate (100 to 300 mg/day) is recommended, particularly in patients starting erythropoietin replacement therapy. Intramuscular iron dextrans can be used, however, the risk of iron overload is
increased. Side effects of iron therapy include gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhea).

Acidosis

Sodium bicarbonate is the most commonly utilized alkalinizing agent but it will contribute to the
sodium load of the patient and may need to be avoided in patients with hypertension or cardiac
insufficiency. Calcium carbonate should be used with caution in hyperphosphatemic patients as
the increased dietary calcium may precipitate soft tissue mineralization. Potassium citrate provides
the additional advantage of supplying potassium and may be attractive for patients with both
hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. The dose of alkalinizing agent needs to be individualized for
each patient and requires routine monitoring of acid base status.

Kidneys

Alkalinizing agents (potassium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate) should be initiated when the TCO2 or bicarbonate concentration is less than 18 mmol/L. Alkalinization therapy
will improve the clinical signs of anorexia, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness and weight
loss in addition to preventing the catabolic effects of metabolic acidosis on protein metabolism.

Two to eight weeks are generally
needed to normalize the hematocrit
during erythropoietin replacement
therapy.

Fluid balance
Compensatory polydipsia balances excessive fluid loss associated with polyuria, however, some
patients will fail to consume sufficient water to prevent volume depletion. In these cases, cautious
fluid supplementation should be used to prevent dehydration and attendant vascular depletion.
Maintenance fluids (eg plasmalyte 56, plasmalyte M, Normosol M) can be administered subcutaneously. Chronic administration of lactated ringers solution or sodium chloride will cause hypernatremia due to failure to provide sufficient free water. Conversely, 5% dextrose in water is hypotonic and should not be administered subcutaneously.

Hypokalemia
Potassium supplementation is indicated when the serum potassium concentration is less than
4 mmol/L and may be achieved by oral potassium gluconate or potassium citrate supplementation.
Muscle weakness typically resolves within five days of institution of therapy. Side effects include
gastrointestinal irritation, ulceration, nausea and vomiting. Potassium dosage should be adjusted
by monitoring the serum potassium concentration and response to supplementation.

263

6 - Treatment

Antihypertensive therapy
Antihypertensive therapy is indicated upon the repeatable demonstration of systemic hypertension. The clinical diagnosis of hypertension should never be made on the basis of a single blood
pressure measurement.
IRIS (http://www.iris-kidney.com/) considers that an animal with CRF is hypertensive when its systolic blood pressure exceeds 180 mm Hg. If the systolic blood pressure is between 150 and 179
mm Hg, and if there is some extrarenal evidence of hypertension (eg. retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy), the animal is also considered hypertensive. Otherwise, the case is borderline and
re-evaluation of blood pressure is recommended within 2 months.
The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to lower the blood pressure to the normal range. The initial selection of antihypertensive agent will be guided by the presence or absence of clinical signs
of hypertension, i.e. signs of retinal detachment and hemorrhage dictate a more aggressive therapeutic approach to lower systemic blood pressure and restore vision in a timely fashion. Repeated
blood pressure determinations will be required to modify and guide a step wide selection of antihypertensive drugs.

Kidneys

Antihypertensive drugs include diuretics, adrenergic antagonists (propanolol), ACE-inhibitors,
calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), and vasodilators. Selection of the appropriate therapeutic agent should be made on the basis of appropriate hypertensive control, expense, and sideeffects. The most commonly recommanded treatment relies on the association between ACEinhibitors and amlodipine. With ACE-inhibitors alone, blood pressure can be decreased by 30 mm
Hg.
The blood pressure should be rechecked within 2 weeks following institution of therapy. If there
has been no response consider:
(1) increasing the dose of the current drug
(2) change to a different class of drug
(3) adding an additional drug to the therapeutic regime.

Long term monitoring of blood pressure is required as frequent
dosage adjustments may be required and some patients will
become refractory to the initial therapy necessitating therapeutic modification.
ACE inhibitors have been used in normotensive dogs with
glomerular disease. Enalapril has been shown to significantly
reduce proteinuria and improve the clinical signs in dogs with
naturally occurring glomerulonephritis (Figure 10) (Grauer
& al, 2000). Proteinuria is not only a biological sign of renal
injury, but also an aggravation factor of CRF. Reducing proteinuria is hence a therapeutic goal. Only the ACE inhibitors
have a demonstrable antiproteinuria effect in dogs. Ace inhibitors can also slow down the progression of CRF (Lefebre &
Toutain, 2004).

6 - Treatment

Hyperphosphatemia
Minimizing hyperphosphatemia will limit renal secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, soft tissue calcification and the progression of renal failure. The restriction of dietary intake and
oral administration of intestinal phosphorus binding agents (Table 6) normalizes serum phosphate
concentrations. Intestinal phosphate binding agents combine with phosphate contained in dietary
and digestive secretions to form insoluble complexes that are excreted in the feces. They should be
mixed with the food prior to feeding to ensure maximal phosphate binding effectiveness.

* Calcium citrate increases aluminum absorption in the intestine and must not be used

Calcitriol replacement therapy
Calcitriol replacement therapy can limit renal secondary hyperparathyroidism. However supplementation is required for life (Nagode et al, 1996). Therapy mandates serial measurement of serum
calcium and phosphorus levels to avoid hypercalcemia and soft tissue mineralization. The risk of
hypercalcemia is heightened by the concurrent administration of calcium based intestinal phosphate binding agents. Calcitriol should not be given with meals because it enhances intestinal
calcium and phosphate absorption. In addition, the serum phosphorus concentration must be
within the normal range prior to initiating therapy to minimize the risk of soft tissue calcification.
The serum PTH concentration should return to normal or almost normal within 1 to 2 weeks of
initiating therapy.
A recent study (Gerber et al, 2003) indicated that calcitriol concentration was within reference
range for most dogs with renal failure. These results suggest that calcitriol replacement would not
be required in such patients.

Gastrointestinal disorders
Antiemetics such as metoclopramide or phenothiazine derivatives can be used to suppress central vomiting centers. Histamine receptor blocking drugs (cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine) or
proton pump blockers (omeprazole) in combination with gastrointestinal protectorant agents
such as sucralfate or misoprostol may be used to prevent gastrointestinal ulceration.

7 - Nutritional management

7 - Nutritional management
Dietary therapy has remained the cornerstone of management of chronic renal failure for decades.
The goals of dietary modification are to (1) meet the patient's nutrient and energy requirements,
(2) alleviate clinical signs and consequences of the uremic intoxication, (3) minimize disturbances
in fluid, electrolyte, vitamin, mineral and acid base balance, and (4) slow progression of the renal
failure (Figure 11).

Energy
Sufficient energy needs to be provided to prevent endogenous protein catabolism which will result
in malnutrition and exacerbation of azotemia. Although the energy requirements of dogs with
chronic renal failure are unknown, they are presumed to be similar to healthy dogs. Dogs should
be fed 132 kcal x body weight (kg)0.75 per day. Determination of caloric requirements may vary by
as much as 25%. Hence energy intake should be individualized to the patient needs based on serial
determinations of body weight and body condition score. Carbohydrate and fat provide the nonprotein sources of energy in the diet. Diets designed for the management of chronic renal failure
are typically formulated with a high fat content because fat provides approximately twice the energy per gram of carbohydrate. Therefore fat increases the energy density of the diet which allows
the patient to obtain its nutritional requirements from a smaller volume of food. A smaller volume of food minimizes gastric distention, which reduces the likelihood of nausea and vomiting.

Protein
Azotemia and uremia are due to the accumulation of protein metabolites derived from excessive
dietary protein and degradation of endogenous protein. High protein intake exacerbates the azotemia and morbidity of chronic renal failure (Polzin et al, 1983), while protein malnutrition is
strongly correlated with morbidity and mortality.
The rationale for formulating a diet that contains a reduced quantity of high quality protein is
based on the premise that controlled reduction of non essential amino-acids results in decreased
production of nitrogenous wastes with consequent amelioration or elimination of clinical signs,
even though renal function remain essentially unchanged. Indeed, studies have shown that modifying dietary protein intake can reduce blood urea nitrogen and provide clinical benefits to dogs
with chronic renal failure (Polzin et al, 1983; Finco et al, 1985; Polzin & Osborne, 1988; Polzin et
al, 1983; Leibetseder & Neufeld, 1991; Jacob et al, 2002). Modified protein diets also moderate the
magnitude of polyuria and polydipsia because less solute is delivered to the kidneys in the form of
nitrogenous waste products. The magnitude of anemia may also be reduced, as nitrogenous waste
266

7 - Nutritional management

products are incriminated in hemolysis, shortened red blood cell survival and blood loss by gastrointestinal ulcerations and impaired platelet function.
Protein restriction has been demonstrated to slow the rate of progression of renal disease in rats
and people. It is less certain if protein restriction alters progression of renal failure in dogs (Finco
et al, 1985; 1992a; 1992b; 1994; 1999; Robertson et al, 1986; Polzin et al, 1988). Most studies have
been performed using the remnant kidney model, which does not necessarily reflect naturally
occurring disease. In addition, some of the studies have been confounded by alterations in energy and/or phosphate intake in addition to protein restriction. Brown et al reported that protein
restriction did not alleviate glomerular hypertension, hypertrophy, hyperfiltration or progression
in dogs with induced renal failure (Brown & al, 1990; 1991a). Although protein moderation has
been clearly demonstrated to improve the clinical status of the uremic patient, it is less clear what
effect protein moderation has on progression of renal disease.
The goal of dietary protein restriction is to reduce the plasma urea as much as possible whilst avoiding protein malnutrition. Although urea is not a major uremic toxin it is regarded as an index
for all nitrogenous wastes, hence therapies designed to reduce urea concentration are presumed to
reduce other uremic toxins and usually correlate with clinical improvement (Leibetseder &
Neufeld, 1991; Hansen et al, 1992; Jacob et al, 2002). Urea concentration may be influenced by
dietary protein intake, dehydration, catabolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, and drug administration (glucocorticoids, tetracyclines). Most pets have minimal clinical signs when the urea is
less than 28 mmol/L or 1.7 g/L (BUN < 80 mg/dL) (Table 7).

*BUN is largely used in the US, while urea is generally used in Europe.

The minimal dietary protein requirements for dogs with chronic renal failure are not known, but
are presumed to be similar to the minimal protein requirements of normal dogs, i.e. 1.33 g/kg/day
(2.62 g/kg BW0.75 or 20 g/1000 kcal ME according to NRC 2006, under press). However, this
degree of restriction is necessary only in animals with profound renal failure, and more liberal prescriptions can be fed to dogs with greater renal function. Every patient symptomatic for chronic
renal failure should benefit from a protein restricted diet. Most renal dry diets contain between 12
and 18% proteins, i.e. 30-45 g/1000 kcal).
The dietary protein should be adjusted to minimize excesses in azotemia while simultaneously
avoiding excessive restriction of dietary protein because of the risk of protein malnutrition. If evidence of protein malnutrition occurs (hypoalbuminemia, anemia, weight loss or loss of body tissue mass), dietary protein should be gradually increased until these abnormalities are corrected.
High quality protein sources must be used in the formulation of restricted protein diets to minimize the risks of essential amino acid deficiency.
Owner dietary compliance can be checked by calculating the BUN:Creatinine ratio (BUN and
creatinine are expressed in mg/dl). On a normal diet it will be around 25 whereas on a restricted
protein diet it will be around 10. A BUN:Creatinine ratio greater than 30 is usually associated
with gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration or sepsis.

Vitamins, minerals and electrolytes
> Phosphorus

Phosphate retention and hyperphosphatemia occur early in the course of renal disease and play
a primary role in the genesis and progression of renal secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, relative or absolute deficiency of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and soft tissue calcification. By minimizing hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism and its sequellae can
be prevented. In addition, dietary phosphorus
restriction has been shown to slow the progresFIGURE 12 - INFLUENCE OF DIETARY PHOSPHORUS RESTRICTION ON LIFE
sion of renal failure in dogs (Brown et al, 1991b).
EXPECTANCY OF DOGS WITH CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
(Finco et al, 1992a)

In one study of dogs with surgically induced
reduced renal function, dogs fed a low phosphorus diet (0.44% DM) had a 75% survival versus
a 33% survival in dogs fed a high phosphorus
diet (1.44% DM) (Finco et al, 1991b). Renal
function also deteriorated more rapidly in the
high phosphorus group (Figure 12).

1.4% phosphorus (n = 12)

After 2 years, 75% of the dogs receiving the low phosphorus diet were still alive,
but only 33% in the group receiving the high-phosphorus diet were alive.

The goal of therapy is to normalize serum phosphate concentration. This may be achieved by
limiting dietary phosphate intake. If normophosphatemia can not been accomplished
within 2-4 weeks of implementing dietary phosphate restriction, intestinal phosphate binders
should be added to the treatment plan. These
agents should be administered with the diet.

> Calcium

Dietary calcium is less important than phosphate in chronic renal failure and hypo, normo, or
hypercalcemia may be observed. It has been recommended that the total calcium x phosphorus
(expressed in mg/dL) product should not exceed 60. This may promote further soft tissue calcification and lead to progression of renal damage. For example, if the calcium concentration is
12 mg/dL and the phosphate concentration is 8 mg/dL, then the calcium x phosphate product is
12x8 = 96, which exceeds 60. Hence calcium supplementation needs to be individualized and
adjusted according to response in terms of measured total blood calcium.
> Sodium

Hypertension is common in dogs with CRF (Jacob et al, 2003). Furthermore, hypertension has
been implicated as a factor that contributes to the progression of renal failure. Dogs with naturally occurring chronic renal disease and a systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg were
more likely to develop a uremic crisis and to die compared with dogs that have a normal systolic
blood pressure (Jacob et al, 2003). Furthermore, the risk of developing a uremic crisis and of dying
increased significantly as systolic blood pressure increased.

268

failure are not yet clearly defined. Current recommendations are normal to mildly restricted sodium diets. The capacity to adjust sodium excretion rapidly in response to
changes in intake becomes severely impaired as renal failure progresses. If sodium intake
is rapidly reduced, dehydration and volume contraction may occur with the potential of
precipitating a renal crisis. Hence, a gradual change from the pet's previous diet to the salt
restricted diet is recommended.
> Potassium

Potassium deficiency has been identified in some dogs with chronic renal failure. Potassium status should be monitored and intake adjusted accordingly with oral potassium gluconate on an
individual basis.
> Vitamins

Kidneys

Water-soluble vitamins are excreted in urine and deficiency may develop due to polyuria associated with chronic renal failure. These losses may be a contributing cause of anorexia and replacement of the losses may be beneficial in correcting or preventing anorexia. Commercially available renal failure diets contain additional amounts of water-soluble vitamins and further supplementation is not required.
Renal excretion of vitamin A is reduced in people with chronic renal failure. A recent study reported that dogs with naturally occurring renal disease had higher plasma concentrations of retinol
compared to healthy dogs (Raila et al, 2003). Therefore, it appears prudent to avoid supplements
containing vitamin A.

Acid base balance
The kidneys are central to the maintenance of acid base balance. As renal function declines, the
capacity to excrete hydrogen ions and reabsorb bicarbonate ions is reduced and metabolic acidosis ensues. Metabolic acidosis increases renal ammoniagenesis which induces tubular inflammation and lesions due to complement activation, contributing to the progression of renal failure.
In addition, metabolic acidosis increases catabolism and degradation of skeletal muscle protein,
disrupts intracellular metabolism, promotes dissolution of bone mineral exacerbating azotemia,
loss of lean body mass and renal osteodystrophy. Dietary protein restriction results in the consumption of reduce quantities of protein-derived acid precursors, however, supplementation with additional alkalinizing agents such as sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate or potassium citrate may
be required.

Omega 3 & 6 fatty acids

Long chain ω-3 fatty acids (EPA-DHA) compete with arachidonic acid and alter eicosanoid,
thromboxane and leukotriene production (Bauer et al, 1999). Remnant kidney studies in dogs
have reported that long chain ω-3 fatty acid supplementation (menhaden fish oil) reduces inflammation, lowers systemic arterial pressure, alters plasma lipid concentrations and preserves renal
function (Figure 13) (Brown et al, 1996; 1998a; 1998b; 2000). The efficacy of shorter chain ω3 fatty acids such as those found in linseed oil, are not yet known.

Compared to a diet consisting of mostly omega 6 fatty acids, a diet with a high fish oil
content appears to improve GFR in the long term whilst minimizing the development
of glomerulosclerosis

Omega 6 fatty acids (safflower oil) appear to be detrimental in dogs with naturally occurring renal
disease by acutely increasing glomerular filtration rate (Bauer et al 1997).
Some commercially available diets have an adjusted ω-6: ω-3 ratio however, rather than focusing
on ratios, the absolute concentrations of specific omega-3 fatty acids would be more appropriate.
Such studies have not yet been reported.

Fiber
Fermentable fiber is a recent addition to the nutritional management of CRF. It is hypothesized
that the fermentable fiber provides a source of carbohydrate for gastrointestinal bacteria which
consequently utilize blood urea as a source of nitrogen for growth. The increase in bacterial cell
mass increases fecal nitrogen excretion and has been suggested to decrease the blood urea nitrogen concentration and reduce the need for protein restriction. However, the major concern with
this concept is that unlike BUN, the classical uremic toxins (middle-molecules) are too large in
molecular size to readily cross membrane barriers. As a consequence, it is highly unlikely that
these toxins are reduced by bacterial utilization of ammonia. Furthermore, studies to document
these changes have not yet been reported. As a consequence, widespread application of fermentable fiber as a nitrogen trap cannot be recommended at this time.
However, even moderate renal disease alters duodenojejunal motility and decreases colonic
transit time in dogs (Lefebvre et al, 2001). Therefore, dietary fiber may be beneficial for improving
gastrointestinal health and motility.

270

7 - Nutritional management

Antioxidants
Endogenous oxidative damage to proteins, lipids and DNA is thought to play an important role
in the progression of renal disease in humans (Locatelli et al, 2003; Cochrane et al, 2003).
Nutrients such as vitamin E, vitamin C, taurine, carotenoids and flavanols are effective antioxidants that trap free radical species. Humans with chronic renal disease have been shown to have
lower concentrations of vitamin E and vitamin C, and high concentrations of markers of lipid
peroxidation (Jackson et al, 1995). These studies suggest that humans with chronic renal disease
have oxidative stress. Studies in rats have suggested that supplementation with vitamin E may
modulate tubulointerstitial injury and glomerulosclerosis, suggesting that vitamin E may slow progression of renal damage (Hahn et al, 1998; 1999). One study in children with focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis reported that vitamin E supplementation decreased proteinuria (Tahzib et al,
1999). There have not been any studies evaluating oxidative stress or antioxidant status in dogs
with renal disease.

FIGURE 14 - CATECHIN MOLECULE

Kidneys

Flavanols, a subclass of flavonoids, are polyphenolic antioxidants which are found in a
variety of plants. (Figure 14). Epigallocatechin gallate is recognized as one of the most
active flavanols in protection against oxidation (Figure 15). Within plants, flavanols
are powerful antioxidants that protect the
integrity of the cell membrane and genetic
material. Flavanols also chelate metal ions
such as iron and copper, which may contribute to their antioxidant activity by preventing redox-active transition metals from
catalyzing free radical formation. In addition, flavonols also appear to modulate
antioxidant enzyme systems.

The base structure of flavanols consists of
two aromatic rings connected with three
carbons to form a six-member heterocyclic
ring.

8 - Feeding Strategy

Flavanols have been reported to be beneficial in renal disease. Flavanols stimulate the production
of nitric oxide which relaxes the vascular system. Daily administration of flavanols to rats was associated with a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Jouad et al, 2001).
Flavanols appear to decrease glomerular capillary pressure in rats with chronic renal failure by:
1) stimulating the production of nitric oxide
2) relaxing the smooth muscle fibers
3) inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme.

8 - Feeding strategy
Dietary therapy is only effective in ameliorating the clinical signs of uremia if it is administered
appropriately. Patients with chronic renal failure often have reduced appetites. In addition, an
altered sense of taste and smell has been reported in people. These factors can be aggravated by
the handicap of reduced dietary intake due to reduced palatability of the modified protein diets
for dogs with chronic renal failure.
However, it is not the palatability of the diets per se, but the effect of uremia on the sense of taste
and smell and the development of food aversion that contribute to inappetance. In this regard, it
is not advisable to institute dietary changes when patients are hospitalized, as there is a high risk
that the patient will develop food aversion. Rather, the renal support diet should be instituted in
the home environment when the pet is stable.

Kidneys

Reduced food intake leads to malnutrition and wasting, which contribute to many aspects of uremia including impaired immune function, delayed wound healing, decreased strength and vigor,
and increased morbidity and mortality. Indeed, malnutrition has been implicated as a factor
influencing outcome in humans with renal failure. Therefore, prevention of malnutrition by ensuring adequate nutrient intake is crucial in the management of renal failure.
Enteral feeding tubes should be instituted for nutritional support upon documentation of a 1015% loss of BW in conjunction with a declining body condition score and a history of poor dietary intake. Enteral feeding tubes are also advantageous as they circumvent the need for subcutaneous fluid therapy and ease the administration of oral medications.
(For more details concerning enteral tube feeding, see chapter 14: critical care nutrition)

Clinical studies of the influence of the diet
on naturally occurring chronic renal failure
The effects of feeding diets with a low phosphorus and moderately restricted protein content have
been investigated in dogs with mild to moderate chronic renal failure (Leibetseder & Neufeld,
1991). Thirty-two dogs with early chronic renal failure were fed a low phosphorus medium protein commercial diet for 28 weeks, and an additional 28 dogs were fed a home-made diet formulated to mimic the commercial diet. Fourteen dogs were euthanized throughout the course of the
study due to progression of renal failure. Within four weeks of feeding either the commercial or
the home made diet, the concentrations of blood urea nitrogen and phosphorus had almost normalized. Both diets were found to be palatable, body weights and serum albumin concentrations
remained stable, and the physical condition of the dogs was considered improved. The results of
this study suggest that dogs with mild to moderate chronic renal failure benefit from early management with a phosphate and protein restricted diet.
The effect of a modified protein, low phosphate diet on the outcome of dogs with stable, naturally occurring CRF has recently been reported (Jacob et al, 2002). Dogs with mild to moderate CRF
that were fed a renal diet had a 70% reduction in the relative risk of developing a uremic crisis,

272

8 - Feeding strategy

remained free of uremic signs almost 2.5 times longer and had a median survival that was three
times longer than dogs with CRF that were fed a maintenance diet. Renal function declined more
slowly in the dogs that were fed the renal diet. The primary cause of death in dogs fed the maintenance diet was renal-related.

Monitoring

A complete history, physical examination,
body weight, body condition score and
laboratory evaluation including CBC, biochemical panel, urine analysis, urine culture and blood pressure evaluation is indicated. Urine culture should become a routine
part of follow up studies as chronic renal failure patients are predisposed to urinary tract
infection, which are often clinically
“silent”.

Practical measures to improve intake include
the use of highly odorous foods, warming
the foods prior to feeding and stimulating
eating by positive reinforcement with
petting and stroking behavior.

When oral ulcerations are present, application of
local xylocaine gel about 10 minutes before the
meal may decrease the pain associated with food
intake.

Kidneys

Regular monitoring to ensure that dietary
and medical management remains optimal
for the needs of the patient is crucial for the
well being and long term successful treatment of the chronic renal failure patient.
Owner compliance may also be improved
by frequent patient evaluation. Patients
should be reevaluated within 2 weeks of initiating therapy and then 3 to 4 times per
year. Recheck examinations should always
be made 2 weeks following medication or
dietary change. Erythropoietin and antihypertensive therapy will initially require
weekly evaluation until the appropriate
maintenance dosage is achieved.

Appetite stimulants such as the benzodiazepam
derivatives or serotonin antagonists may be judiciously administered, however, in these cases, more
aggressive therapy such as esophagostomy or gastrotomy tube feeding is often more effective
(Elliott et al, 2000).

A complete list of all medications and doses
that the client is currently administering to the pet should be obtained to verify compliance. In
addition, some owners will self-adjust medications or simply may be confused by previous instructions.
A complete dietary history including the type of diet (dry versus wet), the amount eaten each day
(eaten is more important than amount offered), the method of feeding, and all treats, snacks and
supplements should also be obtained. This information is invaluable for monitoring the response
to dietary therapy.

Expected outcome and prognosis
CRF is a progressive disease that ultimately results in death. The goal of medical and nutritional
management is to ensure the highest quality of life for the patient, for the longest period of time.
Success depends on owner acceptance and compliance and a coordinated medical approach.
Despite appropriate tailoring of the therapy to the patient’s condition, chronic renal failure is typically dynamic and progressive and eventually leads to end-stage renal failure. The severity of the
clinical signs and uremic complications and the probability of improving renal function (by removing pre-renal contributions, controlling infection etc) will aid in determination of the progno-

273

Conclusion

sis. The severity of the renal function and long term prognosis is best determined by the serum
creatinine concentration. Prognosis and outcome will be heavily influenced by the response to
conservative medical therapy and the rate of progression of the renal dysfunction.
Dietary and conventional medical therapy generally become poorly accepted or ineffective at stage
IV of CRF as defined by IRIS (when plasma creatinine exceeds 5 mg/dL or 400 µmol/L). At this
point owners are frustrated with the poor quality of life of their pet and euthanasia is often the
ultimate outcome. Renal transplantation or chronic intermittent hemodialysis (two or three times
per week) are then the only viable options.

Conclusion

Kidneys

Chronic renal failure is the clinical syndrome resulting from irreversible loss of the metabolic,
endocrine and excretory capacities of the kidney. CRF is the third leading cause of death in
dogs. Nutrition has been the cornerstone of management for decades. The goals of dietary
modification are to meet the patient's nutrient and energy requirements, alleviate clinical signs
and consequences of uremia, minimize disturbances in fluid, electrolyte, vitamin, mineral, and
acid base balance and to slow progression of renal failure. Regular monitoring to ensure that
dietary and medical management remains optimal for the needs of the patient is crucial for the
well being and long term successful treatment of the chronic renal failure patient.

A

Can I add broths and meat juices
to the diet to improve palatability?

No, we do not recommend adding any supplements to the diet. Adding supplements to the diet may
unbalance the key dietary features that we are trying to control with the diet.

Is dry or canned food better for
my pet with renal disease?

For most pets with kidney disease, it will not matter whether they eat canned or dry food, as long as
they are both formulated to assist the management of renal disease. For some pets that do not drink
adequate amounts of water to maintain hydration, canned food may be beneficial to aid the ingestion of water.

When should you start to feed the
renal diet?

Renal diets should be implemented as soon as the diagnosis of kidney disease is made. However, renal
diets should not be fed to pets that are sick and hospitalized. Rather they should be implemented in
the pets normal home environment. Hospitalization is a very stressful event for pets. Changing the
food at that time may foster food aversion.

How often should my pet be
rechecked?

The frequency that a pet is rechecked will depend on what concurrent medications that the pet is
currently receiving. For pets with early disease, they should be rechecked every 3-4 months. If pets
are on hypertensive agents, or erythopoietin therapy, they may need rechecking every two weeks
until the ideal dose of the medication is identified to stabilize the pet.

What do I do if the pet is not
eating enough food and loosing
weight?

If the pet is not eating adequate amounts of food to maintain body weight, then assisted feeding by
the placement of esophagostomy or gastrostomy tubes should be considered. Therefore, on the days
that the pet will not eat the appropriate amount of food, the food can be blended and administered
to the pet.

Key Points
- Reducing the phosphorus content to mitigate the
less good phosphorus excretion by the kidney during CRD
and prevent the risk of hyperparathyroidism, which
aggravates renal failure.
- Increasing the energy concentration to help limit the
meal volume while covering energy requirements. The goal
is to compensate the fall in appetite.
- Moderating the protein content to compensate the
fall in the glomerular filtration rate

*The rationing is offered in accordance with the dog’s healthy weight. In case of obesity,
the rationing must be prescribed in accordance with the ideal weight and not the real weight of the dog.
**The fractioning of the daily amount over two or three meals is recommended to favor good digestion.

An adapted diet helps triple

of dogs with chronic
renal disease.

Key Points
to remember:

Kidneys

The role of nutrition in the management
and prevention of chronic renal disease
Chronic renal disease (CRD) in dogs
is often associated with a waxing
and waning appetite. Therefore
the palatability of the food is a key
criterion in the management of
CRD.
When the kidney loses its functional capacity, phosphorus is no longer adequately excreted and the
concentration increases in plasma.
Ultimately, hyperphosphatemia
causes hyperparathyroidism that
aggravates CRD. One of the goals
of treatment is to normalize the
blood phosphate concentration. It
has been clearly shown that the
dietary restriction of phosphorus
slows the progression of renal
disease in dogs.
Supplementation with alkalizing
agents such as sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate or potassium
citrate can prove necessary to combat metabolic acidosis.
Contrary to a common misconception, the protein content of the

280

food does not have any impact on
the progression of renal disease. It
is therefore useless to systematically reduce the protein in the diet of
an aging dog. Conversely, in dogs
with CRD the goal of protein
reduction is to reduce the magnitude of uremia. To prevent protein malnutrition, moderate restriction of the order of 35-40 g protein/1000 kcal is preferable. Too
severe protein reduction could
actually have negative effects, by
forcing the dog to catabolize its
body proteins to meet its needs.
Energy intake must be sufficient to
prevent endogenous protein catabolism that leads to malnutrition
and aggravated azotemia.
An increased intake of omega 3
fatty acids (EPA and DHA) helps
limit the reduction in glomerular
filtration rate.
Hypokalemia is commonly observed in dogs with renal disease,
except in the terminal stage, when

hyperkalemia may be observed.
Reestablishing a normal serum
potassium concentration is essential to the dog’s quality of life.
It has long been recommended to
reduce the sodium content in the
diets of patients with CRD.
However, recent work (see chapter
seven) would appear to show that
too low of a sodium content (0.40.5 mg/1000 kcal) could have a
deleterious effect on renal function. Low sodium intake could
contribute to glomerular hypertension by increasing the secretion
of aldosterone and activating the
renin-angiotensin system. These
results are yet to be confirmed but
they caution against too severe
sodium restriction in the diet of
patients with CRD.
Aging dogs generally suffer from
renal disease hence it is necessary
to enrich the food with antioxidants to help combat free radical
production.

Focus on:

PHOSPHORUS
Etymologically speaking, the word
phosphorus means ‘light-bringing.’
It was discovered in 1669 by a
German alchemist, Hennig Brandt.
By evaporating urine and calcifying the residue, he obtained
phosphorus in gas form that shone
in the dark.
In the form of phosphates, phosphorus enters into the composition
of bone. Eighty-six percent of the

phosphorus in the organism is stored in the structure of the skeleton.
Phosphorus is also incorporated
into large molecules such as DNA,
RNA and membrane phospholipids. In addition, it is an active
constituent of the adenosine triphosphate molecule (ATP), which
stores the energy living organisms
need to function properly.

The reasons why phosphorus leads
to progression of CRD have yet to
be determined with certainty.
Following the reduction of the
renal function, phosphorus accumulates in the blood. The organism responds physiologically by
increasing the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). This response initially helps maintain the
phosphorus within normal thre-

sholds, but also leads to the release
of phosphate and calcium from
bone reserves.
In time, even this compensatory
response is not enough to reestablish homeostasis. Phosphorus and
calcium accumulate, leading to the
mineralization of soft tissue. In the
kidney, this phenomenon accelerates the loss of functional
nephrons. In addition, PTH may act
as an uremic toxin, which also
aggravates the clinical symptoms
and progression of CRD.

In CRD patients, the goal is therefore to limit the phosphorus
content of the food to 0.400.80 g/1000 kcal. At the same time,
the increase in the calcium content
also helps reduce the digestive
absorption of phosphorus. If such a
level does not help normalize the
serum phosphate concentration,
the use of phosphate binding
agents (aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate etc) should be
considered.
While it is vital to limit the phosphorus content in the food, the

difficulty lies in the necessity of finding raw ingredients that are low
in phosphorus. Animal protein
sources traditionally used in dog
food are fairly high in phosphorus.
For example, there is 1.6-2.5%
phosphorus on a DMB in dehydrated poultry proteins. This level is
dependent on the overall content
of remaining mineral matter after
sieving. Vegetable protein sources
that are lower in phosphate
concentration (wheat or corn gluten, soy protein isolate hydrolysate) are an interesting alternative.

rolithiasis is defined as the formation of
sediment, consisting of one or more poorly
soluble crystalloids, in the urinary tract.
Microscopic sediment is referred to as crystals, and
larger macroscopic precipitates are called uroliths.
Urolithiasis is a common problem in dogs. Uroliths
can form anywhere in the urinary tract, although
in dogs the vast majority occur in the bladder.
Urolithiasis is responsible for about 18% of
veterinary consultations in dogs with lower
urinary tract disorders (Figure 1) (Lulich et al, 2000).

1- Introduction

1 - Introduction
The four most common minerals found in canine uroliths are magnesium ammonium phosphate
(struvite), calcium oxalate, ammonium urate and cystine (Osborne et al, 1995; Osborne et al,
1999b; Houston et al, 2004) (Figures 2 & 3, Table 1). Less common urolith types are calcium
phosphate, silicate, drugs and drug metabolites.

© Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition

Calcium oxalate and struvite are the predominant mineral types in canine nephroliths (Ross et
al, 1999). The incidence of urolithiasis and the composition of uroliths may be influenced by a
variety of factors including breed, sex, age, diet, anatomic abnormalities, urinary tract infection
(UTI), urine pH and medications (Ling, 1998). Identification of these risk factors is essential for
effective management and prevention of urolithiasis. Urolithiasis often has a high recurrence rate.
This has led to an increasing use of dietary management for both dissolution and prevention of
uroliths, although some mineral types are more amenable to dissolution than others.

Struvite uroliths used to be the most common type, but during the last twenty years the prevalence of
calcium oxalate urolithiasis has been increasing and that of struvite urolithiasis decreasing; although the
latter still predominates (Ling et al, 2003).
*data from the Canadian Veterinary Urolith Centre

2 - Diagnosis
History and clinical signs
Symptoms of urolithiasis are mainly due to irritation of the mucosa of the lower urinary tract,
resulting in signs of cystitis and/or urethritis. The most common signs are hematuria, dysuria and
pollakiuria. Occasionally, urolithiasis may lead to urethral obstruction, which is a medical and surgical emergency. Renal calculi may furthermore cause pyelonephritis, outflow obstruction, reduction of renal mass, azotemia and renal failure. Conversely some patients are clinically asymptomatic.

Differential diagnosis
Other common causes of hematuria, dysuria and frequent urination, with or without urethral
obstruction, are UTI, polyps and neoplasia. These can be distinguished by urine culture and
imaging studies.

285

2 - Diagnosis of urolithiasis

Laboratory testing and imaging
Urinalysis, quantitative urine culture and imaging (plain and double contrast radiography and/or
ultrasonography) are required to confirm urolithiasis and to look for predisposing factors.
Evaluation of serum biochemistries is useful for the recognition of underlying abnormalities and
assessment of renal function in dogs with nephrolithiasis. Urine chemistries can furthermore
reveal excessive quantities of one or more minerals contained in the urolith.
> Urinalysis

Urinalysis typically shows inflammation: proteinuria, hematuria and pyuria. Urine pH varies,
depending upon stone type, presence or absence of infection, and diet. In general, struvite uroliths are associated with alkaline urine, particularly if urease-producing bacteria are present. Urate
and cystine formation tends to be associated with acid to neutral pH (Osborne et al, 1995). In
contrast urine pH is a less important factor in calcium oxalate formation.
Crystalluria may be present without urolithiasis, and urolithiasis may occur without crystalluria.
In addition, crystals are not necessarily representative of the urolith type, since they may be
influenced by a urease-producing bacterial infection that could generate struvite crystals. However, ammonium urate crystals (Figure 4) may indicate portosystemic shunting, and cystine crystals are pathognomonic of cystinuria (Figure 5). The presence of crystals depends on urine pH,
temperature and concentration. Urine samples should be examined within 30 minutes of collection and should not be refrigerated.
> Urine culture

Urolithiasis

Urine bacterial culture and sensitivity should be performed in all dogs to assess for primary or
secondary UTI. Bacterial culture of the inner parts of possible infection-induced stones may also
be beneficial, since bacteria in the urine may not be the same as those harbored in the urolith
(Osborne et al, 1995). If a cystotomy is performed for stone removal, it is recommended to submit
a piece of bladder mucosa for culture and sensitivity as this is more sensitive than culturing the
urine (Hamaide et al, 1998).
> Imaging techniques

Radiography and/or ultrasonography are indicated to verify the presence of uroliths, as well as their
location, number, size, radiodensity and shape (Figure 6). Uroliths have to be greater than 3 mm
to be detected by survey abdominal radiography or ultrasonography. Urate uroliths are the most
radiolucent and usually require double contrast cystography for visualization. Retrograde contrast
studies are required to assess urethral stones, and excretory urography if renal calculi are suspected.

Cystoscopy requires specialized equipment and general
anesthesia, but it can be very helpful to confirm urolithiasis and to remove small uroliths from the bladder or
urethra (Cannizzo et al, 2001).

Uroliths may be collected by spontaneous voiding, voiding urohydropropulsion (Osborne et al, 1999e), aspiration into a urethral catheter, cystoscopy, or surgical
removal. Urolith composition should be determined by
quantitative physical analyses, which are far more accurate than qualitative chemical techniques. Uroliths can

contain more than one mineral type, and layer-by-layer mineral analysis may be
required in compound stones. It is, therefore, important not to crush the uroliths
before analysis. The initiating cause of the uroliths can be determined by the mineral composition of the nucleus, which may be different from the surrounding layers
(Osborne et al, 1999c).

Effective dissolution of uroliths depends on knowledge of their mineral composition.
Ideally a urolith should be retrieved and analyzed, and a number of factors can help
in predicting urolith composition (Tables 2, 3).

> Struvite

Struvite (Mg NH4 PO4 6 H2O) is one of the most common minerals found in canine uroliths
(Figure 7). Oversaturation of urine with magnesium ammonium phosphate ions is a requirement,
but several other factors – including UTI, alkaline urine, diet and genetic predisposition – may
influence formation. In dogs, most struvite uroliths are associated with a bacterial UTI (Figure 8)
with urease producing bacteria such as Staphylococcus spp (often S. intermedius) or, less commonly,
Proteus spp. Urease is an enzyme that hydrolyzes urea, leading to elevations of ammonium, phosphate and carbonate, resulting in alkaline urine. Many struvite uroliths also contain a small quantity of other minerals, such as calcium phosphate and, less commonly, ammonium urate.
Sterile struvite uroliths are rare in dogs; their etiopathogenesis may include dietary, metabolic or
familial factors, but does not involve bacterial urease (Osborne et al, 1995).

> Calcium oxalate

Figure 7: Struvite stones

288

The main risk factor is supersaturation of urine with calcium and oxalate, with calcium relatively more important (Stevenson, 2002, Stevenson et al 2003a). A major factor is intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium, which is recognized as a cause of calcium oxalate urolithiasis in both humans
and dogs susceptible to calcium oxalate urolithiasis (Lulich et al, 2000; Stevenson, 2002). Indirectly,
this leads to hyperoxaluria, since it increases the availability of oxalate for absorption. The relationship between intestinal absorption of calcium and oxalic acid is clinically important, since
reducing the concentration of calcium increases oxalate absorption, thus maintaining or increasing the risk of stone formation. Diet may have a significant role in the development of these uroliths (see risk factors) (Lekcharoensuk et al, 2002a; 2002b).

Urolithiasis

Bacterial infection with urease producing organisms results in the cleavage of urea to generate ammonia and carbon
dioxide. The carbon dioxide can dissociate with water to alkalinize the urine. The alkaline pH enables phosphate and
ammonium ions to bind with magnesium to form a molecule of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite).

Diseases that increase urinary excretion of calcium and oxalic acid play a smaller role. Calcium oxalate
(Figure 9) and phosphate uroliths have been reported in dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism, but
not in dogs with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia (Klausner et al, 1987; Lulich et al, 2000).

Any form of severe hepatic dysfunction may predispose dogs to urate urolithiasis, but there is a
specific predisposition in dogs with congenital or acquired portosystemic shunts (Kruger et al,
1986, Bartges et al, 1999). These dogs frequently develop intermittent crystalluria, urate calculi,
or both. Hepatic dysfunction in these dogs may be associated with reduced hepatic conversion of
uric acid to allantoin and of ammonia to urea, resulting in hyperuricemia and hyperammonemia,
but the precise mechanism is uncertain.

Figure 9: Calcium oxalate stones

© Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition

Uric acid is one of several biodegradation products of purine nucleotide metabolism. In non-Dalmatian dogs, almost all urate formed from degradation of purine nucleotides is metabolized by
hepatic uricase to allantoin, which is very soluble and excreted by the kidneys. In Dalmatian dogs,
only 30-40% of uric acid is converted to allantoin, resulting in increased serum levels and urinary excretion of urate (Bartges et al, 1999). Ensuing uroliths are most commonly composed of ammonium urate (Figure 10). The defective uric acid mechanism in Dalmatian dogs probably involves
both alterations in the hepatic and renal pathways, but the exact mechanism is incompletely
understood. Reduced urinary excretion of crystallization inhibitors may contribute to stone formation in Dalmatians (Carvalho et al, 2003). Urolithiasis in the Dalmatian is probably autosomal
recessive inherited (Sorenson & Ling, 1993), although this does not explain the increased risk of
stone formation for male dogs.

3 - Epidemiology

Relatively little is known about urate urolithiasis in non-Dalmatian dogs that do not have portosystemic shunts, although a familial tendency has been suggested for English Bulldogs (Kruger et
al, 1986; Bartges et al, 1994). Dietary risk factors for urate urolithiasis include high purine diets
(e.g; diets rich in offal) and low water consumption. Urine acidity promotes urate lithogenesis,
because purines are less soluble at acid pH. Consumption of diets that promote aciduria such as
high protein diets are therefore also a risk factor for predisposed dogs (Bartges et al, 1999).
> Cystine

© Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition

These uroliths (Figure 11) occur in dogs with cystinuria, an inborn error of metabolism characterized by a defective proximal tubular reabsorption of cystine and other amino acids. Cystinuric
dogs reabsorb a much smaller proportion of cystine that is filtered by the glomerulus and some may
even have net cystine secretion (Casal et al, 1995). Cystinuria is usually the only detectable sign
of their amino acid loss unless protein intake is severely restricted. Cystine urolithiasis develops
because cystine is only sparingly available at the usual urine pH of 5.5 to 7.0. Not all cystinuric
dogs form uroliths, and calculi are often not recognized until maturity. They occur predominantly in male dogs, and other undetermined factors may therefore also play a role in the pathogenesis. Canine cystinuria is genetically heterogeneous and has been recognized in more than 60 breeds
of dogs with variable patterns of aminoaciduria (Case et al, 1992, 1993; Osborne et al, 1999g, Henthorn et al, 2000).

Urolithiasis

Figure 11: Cystine stones

Calcium phosphate uroliths (Figure 12) are commonly called apatite uroliths, with hydroxyapatite and carbonate apatite the most common forms. They occur commonly as a minor component
of struvite and calcium oxalate stones. Pure calcium phosphate uroliths are infrequently found,
and they are usually associated with metabolic disorders (primary hyperparathyroidism, other
hypercalcemic disorders, renal tubular acidosis, idiopathic hypercalciuria) and/or excessive dietary calcium and phosphorus (Kruger et al, 1999). Calcium phosphate crystals can trigger calcium
oxalate crystallization by allowing heterogeneous crystallization to occur at a lower urinary supersaturation than homogeneous crystallization. The risks associated with calcium phosphate formation therefore should be taken in account when treating other urolith types.
Silica urolithiasis is a recently discovered disease (Aldrich et al, 1997). The pathogenesis may
involve consumption of an absorbable form of silica in various foods, resulting in urinary silica
hyperexcretion. The recent emergence of these uroliths may have some relationship to the increased use of plant-derived ingredients such as fibers and bran in dog foods (Osborne et al, 1995).

Figure 12: Calcium phosphate
stones

Compound uroliths consist of a nucleus of one mineral type and a shell of another mineral type.
They form because factors promoting precipitation formation of one type of urolith supersede earlier factors promoting precipitation of another mineral type. Some minerals types may also function as a nidus for deposition of another mineral; for instance, all uroliths predispose to UTI, which
may result in secondary struvite precipitation.

3 - Epidemiology
Causes
Urolithiasis is the result of underlying inherited, congenital or acquired disorders, resulting in
increased urinary excretion of certain minerals and/or predisposition to urolith formation (Osborne et al, 1995). Urine composition may be altered by metabolic abnormalities. An inherited
mechanism has been proven in Dalmatians (urate) and Newfoundland dogs (cystine) (Sorenson
& Ling, 1993; Henthorn et al, 2000), and the predilection in several other breeds suggests a possible genetic basis. Congenital causes can directly (e.g. congenital cystinuria) or indirectly (e.g.
urogenital malformations) predispose an individual to form uroliths. Acquired disorders include

Predisposition and risk factors
> Breed, sex, age

The incidence and mineral composition of uroliths
may be influenced by a complex interaction of
multiple factors, including age, sex, genetic
predisposition and breed, diet, water consumption,
lifestyle and the presence of UTI.

3 - Epidemiology

UTI with urease forming bacteria as well as metabolic disorders that result in an
increased mineral excretion (e.g. hypercalcemia). Administration of drugs may be
an aggravating cause in some cases (Osborne et al, 1999f).

Urolithiasis tends to affect smaller dog breeds more often than larger breeds (Lulich
et al, 2000). The predisposition for smaller breeds may be related to their lower urine
volume, fewer numbers of micturitions, and therefore increased mineral concentrations (Ling, 1998; Stevenson & Markwell, 2001) (Table 4).
Breed predisposition for specific mineral types may suggest a genetic basis, and is often significantly
correlated with the sex (Table 3) (Stevenson, 2002). The genetic mode of inheritance has been
determined for cystinuria in Newfoundland dogs, where it has been shown that the disease is transmitted in a simple autosomal recessive pattern (Casal et al, 1995; Henthorn et al, 2000).
Most forms of urolithiasis are more common in male dogs, whereas struvite urolithiasis has a high
incidence in female dogs, probably related to their greater susceptibility to develop bacterial UTIs
(Table 5).
Urolithiasis usually occurs in mature dogs, although the age range is wide. Calcium containing stones
(phosphate and oxalate) tend to be found in older dogs.
> Diet and water consumption

Urolithiasis

Diet can influence urine composition and dietary factors therefore play a significant role in increasing the risk of urolithiasis, although this may differ for certain mineral types (Table 6).

Several dietary factors have been suggested to play a role in the development of calcium oxalate
urolithiasis, including low dietary moisture and sodium, and high protein content. A greater risk
is associated with dry formulations (Ling et al 1998; Lekcharoensuk et al, 2002a, 2002b). High moisture diets and a moderate increase in dietary sodium have been shown to reduce the risk of calcium oxalate formation in susceptible breeds of dog (Stevenson et al, 2003b; 2003c). Severe purine restriction has been found to reduce urinary urate excretion in both healthy dogs and Dalmatians. There is also a strong link between silica urolithiasis and the feeding of diets high in plant
ingredients such as bran or soybean hulls (Lulich et al, 2001).

UTIs predispose an individual to struvite urolithiasis, especially when associated with urease-forming bacteria. As urinary infections are more frequent in females than in males, this helps to
explain why struvite uroliths occur more frequently in females and in particular spayed females.
> Environment

Differences in the pattern of urolith formation are observed between countries. Factors that predispose an individual to dehydration (e.g. hot climate, limited access to fresh water), or urinary
retention in the bladder (indoor lifestyle) can increase the likelihood of urolith formation (Franti et al, 1999).

sorption or secretion, and precipitation of drugs and their metabolites (Osborne et al,
1999b,1999f). The prevalence of drug-induced urolithiasis is unknown, although drugs and their
metabolites are more likely to precipitate in urine if uroliths are already present. The older generation sulfonamides have been most frequently implicated, although precipitation and urolithiasis may also occur with the newer generations drugs when given for prolonged times at high
concentrations.
> Metabolic influences
Prolonged hypercalcemia and subsequent calciuria may increase the risk of calcium containing stones.
Hyperadrenocorticism has been associated with calcium oxalate stones, since glucocorticosteroids
increase mobilization of calcium from bone and reduce tubular resorption, resulting in calciuria (Hess

et al, 1998; Lulich et al, 1999).
Chronic metabolic acidosis may also contribute to calcium oxalate urolithiasis, which is attributed to
buffering of excess hydrogen ions by bone phosphorus and carbonates, with concurrent release of calcium (Lulich et al, 1999) (Figure 13).
Cystinuria is an inherited inborn error of metabolism that predisposes to cystine urolith formation,
although not all dogs with cystinuria or cystine crystalluria form uroliths.

4 - Pathophysiology
Urolith formation
> Relative supersaturation (Figure 14)

Urolithiasis

Urine supersaturation is the driving force for the formation of crystals within the urinary tract.
Determination of the relative supersaturation (RSS) of urine with specific minerals has been used
to identify dogs at risk for urolith formation. RSS is considered a more accurate predictor of urine
crystallization potential than the formerly used activity product ratio (APR). The main limitation of the APR technique is the assumption that a steady state with respect to the solid phase
will be reached by the end of the 48-hour incubation period, whereas it may take urine up to nine

days to reach the equilibrium, particularly when coming from oversaturation (Robertson et al,
2002; Stevenson et al, 2003c). In a simple solution, an RSS less than one corresponds to the undersaturated zone, and an RSS greater than one indicates the supersaturated zone. However, as urine
is a complex solution, even if the urine is supersaturated, significant urine flow, inhibitors of crystallization or aggregation, and ionic forces can prevent stone formation. This is the metastable
zone (Figure 14). If the urine becomes even more concentrated, crystals will form spontaneously, which is called supersaturation. The RSS at which the urine will become supersatured depends
upon the mineral(s) involved; it is around 2.5 for struvite and 10 to 14 for calcium oxalate in
human urine (Robertson, personal communication).
> Nucleation

The first step in the urolith development process is the formation of a crystal nidus (embryo). This
phase, called nucleation, is dependent on supersaturation of urine with calculogenic substances,
so that precipitation of salts and crystallization can occur (Robertson, 1993). The degree of urine
supersaturation may be influenced by factors such as the magnitude of renal excretion of crystalloids, favorable urine pH for crystallization (Figure 15), urinary retention, and a decreased
concentration of crystallization inhibitors in the urine (Robertson et al, 2002).
There are many documented urinary inhibitors of calcium oxalate formation including magnesium, citrate, and macromolecular inhibitors such as nephrocalcin and glycosaminoglycans
(Robertson et al, 2002). The role of inhibitors within canine calcium oxalate formation has yet to
be fully explored.

Urolithiasis

Urinary ion composition can affect nucleation and precipitation when there is interaction between elements in the urine. For example, magnesium binds to oxalate and citrate can bind to calcium; magnesium and citrate are therefore considered inhibitors of calcium oxalate urolithiasis.

Calcium oxalate

Urinary pH can have a marked influence on the solubility
of certain crystals and calculi. Struvite crystals are the most
sensitive to changes in urine pH. Acidification of urine
increases the solubility of struvite crystals, reducing the risk
of struvite urolithiasis. Other crystals, particularly calcium
oxalate, are less sensitive to urine pH.

5 - Nutritional management

> Growth of crystals

Once nucleation has occurred, crystal growth may occur at lesser degrees of supersaturation. Further growth of the crystal nidus then depends on the duration of its passage through the urinary
tract, degree and duration of urine supersaturation for similar or other crystalloids, and crystal properties. The mechanisms leading to crystal growth are still uncertain and may include growth
around a nidus or a matrix lattice, which might be facilitated by a lack of crystal aggregation inhibitors (Osborne et al, 1995).

Fate of uroliths
Uroliths may pass through various parts of the urinary tract and/or be voided, undergo spontaneous dissolution, become inactive or continue to grow. Not all persistent uroliths result in clinical signs.

5 - Nutritional management
Stimulating diuresis

There has nonetheless been some controversy
about the use of sodium chloride to stimulate
thirst and diuresis, because it could potentially
affect urinary calcium excretion and blood pressure (Lulich et al, 1999; Osborne et al, 2000).
In humans, high salt intake has been associated
with increased urinary calcium excretion, and
similar observations were initially made in dogs
(Lulich et al, 1999; Devois et al, 2000; Biourge et
al, 2001). This led to the assumption that saltenriched diets could promote calcium oxalate
urolithiasis and that diets for management of
LUTD should thus be salt-restricted (Osborne et
al, 2000; Allen et al, 2000).
However, later studies failed to observe an effect
of dietary salt on urinary calcium excretion in
dogs (Stevenson et al, 2003b). Epidemiological
studies in dogs furthermore showed that increasing dietary sodium actually reduced the risk of
calcium oxalate urolithiasis, because the dilutional effect of higher dietary sodium offsets the
tendency towards hypercalciuria (Lekcharoensuk
et al, 2001; 2002).

Urolithiasis

The easiest way to produce undersaturated urine is to promote diuresis. Increasing urinary flow
reduces the concentration of lithogenic substances, which outweighs the disadvantage of diluting
crystallization inhibitors. High urine volumes also increase the frequency of urination, which helps
remove any free crystals that form in the urinary tract (Borghi et al, 1999). To stimulate diuresis,
drinking must be encouraged. This can be done either by feeding canned diets that contain 70 to
80% water, by adding water to the diet or by slightly increasing the sodium chloride content of
dry diets. Increased dietary sodium chloride has been shown to increase water intake as well as
urine production, and to decrease urine supersaturation in dogs and cats (Stevenson et al, 2003b,
Lulich et al, 2005) (Figure 16).

6 - General management of urolithiasis

Several studies have shown that moderately increased dietary salt intakes (up to 3.2 g Na/1000
Kcal ME) do not alter blood pressure in healthy dogs, and dogs with induced renal disease (Greco
et al, 1994; Biourge et al, 2002; Kirk, 2002; Burankarl et al, 2003; Luckschander et al, 2004).

Changing urine pH
Changing urine pH, via dietary manipulation or medical means, can be very effective in the management of some but not all uroliths. Urine acidification markedly increases struvite solubility and
is essential in the medical dissolution of these uroliths. In contrast, urine alkalinization is important in increasing the solubility of urate and cystine uroliths (Figure 15). Diet efficacy is generally increased if it also reduces urinary excretion of the crystalloids that participate in urolith formation (Lulich et al, 2000).
Most other urolith types are less amenable to dissolution based upon pH changes. It is furthermore advisable to aim for a urine pH that prevents further precipitation and potentiates excretion of other minerals that may co-precipitate or act as inhibitors.

6 - General management of urolithiasis
Dissolution protocols are aimed at dissolving the urolith or arresting further growth by reducing
the supersaturation of urine with calculogenic substances.

Relief of urinary tract obstruction if necessary
This will generally require surgical removal once the patient has been stabilized. Urethral calculi in male dogs may be flushed retrograde into the bladder prior to surgery or medical dissolution.

Urolithiasis

Elimination of existing uroliths
> Medical dissolution

Dietary modification may reduce intestinal absorption and urinary excretion of crystalloids and
can also modulate urine pH. The balance between different nutrients (including calcium, phosphorus, sodium, acidifiers, dietary fiber and oxalate) depends on the formulation of the diet. This
allows manufacturers to formulate diets that can change the urinary pH, stimulate diuresis, and
reduce urinary mineral excretions, thereby assisting in the management of urinary stone diseases. Strategies vary according to stone
type (see nutritional management). Calcium oxalate, calcium
phosphate and silica uroliths cannot be dissolved medically at a

urohydropropulsion, or cystotomy

• Ureteral and urethral stones are less amenable to medical
dissolution because they are not consistently in contact with
undersaturated urine. Ureteroliths, when associated with complete
ureteral obstruction and hydronephrosis mandate surgical removal.
Ureteroliths that are associated with partial ureteral obstruction
can be managed conservatively as they may move into the bladder.
With respect to urethroliths it is often possible to flush them
retrograde into the bladder where they can be managed with
medical dissolution
• Nephroliths maybe treated by surgical removal, although medical
dissolution for struvite uroliths is a consideration. Benign neglect is
possible in uninfected and non-obstructing nephroliths

296

Adjunctive medical management is indicated when UTI is present, the urolith type is poorly amenable to dietary changes, or
when there is further urolith growth. Certain drugs act specifically by interrupting metabolic pathways of crystalloid excretion, for
example allopurinol in purine urolithiasis of Dalmatian dogs. Acidifying or alkalizing drugs can help alter urine pH.

During dissolution, uroliths become smaller and may pass into the
urethra (in the male dog) or ureters, causing urinary obstruction
and/or hydronephrosis. Owners should be warned about this possibility, and regular radiographic re-evaluation is required during

> Mechanical removal

Surgery is indicated for stone types that are not or poorly amenable to
medical dissolution and too large to be voided through the urethra, or
when they are causing urinary obstruction. It is also required in dogs
with anatomic defects of the urinary tract (e.g. bladder diverticulum)
that predispose to UTI; in these cases stone removal can be combined
with correction of the defect. Surgery alone is associated with a high
rate of recurrence, since it does not correct the underlying factors causing urolithiasis and because it may be difficult to remove very small
stones or fragments, which can later function as a nidus for further
stone formation (Lulich et al, 2000). Post-operative imaging is necessary to ensure that all calculi have been removed.

THE GENERAL AIM OF DIETARY MANAGEMENT
OF UROLITHIASIS IS TO REDUCE SUPERSATURATION
OF URINE WITH CALCULOGENIC SUBSTANCES BY:
• increasing water intake and thus urine volume to decrease urine
crystalloid concentration
• altering the urine pH to increase the solubility of crystalloids in
the urine
• changing the diet to decrease the quantity of crystalloids
excreted in the urine

6 - General management of urolithiasis

medical dissolution of nephroliths to detect ureteral calculi before they
cause hydronephrosis (Osborne et al, 1999d, Lulich et al, 2000). The
dissolution process can last from 1 to 6 months.

Small uroliths in the bladder and/or urethra can sometimes be removed during voiding urohydropropulsion or cystoscopy (Osborne et al, 1999e).
Lithotripsy has recently been described as a means of fragmenting uroliths. Fragmentation of renal
and ureteral uroliths using electrohydraulic or extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy has been
documented in a small number of dogs (Block et al, 1996; Adams et al, 1999). Laser lithotripsy has
been reported effective in fragmenting bladder uroliths (Davidson et al, 2004). However, all these
techniques have limited availability.

Urolithiasis

Eliminate miscellaneous risk factors
Acidifying diets are useful in preventing struvite urolithiasis but should be avoided in dogs with
urate urolithiasis.
Treatment of UTI is mandatory to reduce the risk of struvite urolith formation.
Treat underlying diseases that may potentiate urolithiasis (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism).

Prevention of recurrence
Correct underlying causes.
Minimize risk factors (dietary adaptation).

Struvite uroliths are generally sensitive to medical dissolution using a calculolytic diet in association with antibiotic therapy.

Infection-induced struvite uroliths require a combination of appropriate antimicrobial and calculolytic dietary therapy. Sterile struvite uroliths do not need antibiotics, and can be dissolved using
calculolytic dietary therapy alone or by using urinary acidifiers (Osborne et al, 1999d; Rinkardt &
Houston, 2004) (Figure 17).

Antibiotic treatment should be based upon culture and sensitivity determination of
urine obtained by cystocentesis. It should be continued until uroliths can no longer
be detected radiographically, since viable bacteria may remain inside the urolith (Seaman & Bartges, 2001). Urine should be sterile on repeated cultures, and antibiotics
should be changed (according to sensitivity results) if UTI persists.
> Calculolytic diet to dissolve uroliths

Three molecules are needed to form
one struvite molecule. This reaction is
reversible in an acid environment.

298

These diets are aimed to reduce urine concentrations of urea, phosphorus and magnesium (Lulich et al, 2000). Commercial calculolytic diets contain moderate amounts of
protein (15-20% in a 4000 kcal/kg diet), are highly digestible, low in fiber (to reduce fecal water loss), and contain increased levels of NaCl. Dietary protein restriction
reduces the amount of substrate (urea) available in urine for urease-producing bacteria. Dietary efficacy has been shown in clinical studies (Osborne et al, 1999d; Rinkardt
& Houston, 2004). Calculolytic diets should be given for at least one month after
removal or dissolution of struvite uroliths, because uroliths too small for radiographic
detection may still be present. Dogs can then be changed to a normal diet.

7 - Specicific nutritional management

Dissolution therapy should be monitored with monthly abdominal radiographs or ultrasound examination and regular urinalyses (pH of morning urine should be 6.5, with no evidence of UTI).
The average time for dissolution of infection-induced struvite uroliths is approximately 3 months,
although clinical signs usually resolve in the first 2 weeks, probably due to control of the UTI.
Sterile struvite stones tend to dissolve more rapidly, typically taking 5-6 weeks (Osborne et al,
1999d).
> Drug therapy

Urinary acidifying agents such as ammonium chloride are not necessary provided a calculolytic
diet and antimicrobials are given. Persistent alkaline urine pH indicates continued UTI, and pH
will not go down until this is controlled (Lulich et al, 2000).
Acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) is a microbial urease inhibitor that blocks the hydrolysis of urea
to ammonia, consequently lowering urine pH and ammonium concentration. It may therefore
inhibit struvite growth and promote dissolution. AHA (12.5 mg/kg orally every 12 h) may be helpful in dogs with infection-induced struvite urolithiasis that is refractory to antibiotic therapy and
dietary dissolution (Krawiec et al, 1984). However, this drug has many side effects, including
hemolytic anemia, anorexia and vomiting. It should not be given to dogs with renal failure, since
it is excreted via the kidneys, or to pregnant animals, since it is teratogenic (Baillie et al, 1986;
Osborne et al, 1995).
Amino acid preparations have been reported effective in the dissolution of sterile struvite nephroliths, although this concerned only 2 dogs; their efficacy is probably due to urine acidification
(Mishina et al, 2000). There are no reports of its use in dogs with infection-induced struvite stones.

Urolithiasis

The most important factor in preventing infection-induced struvite urolithiasis is resolution of the
underlying UTI and prevention of recurrence. Preventative dietary therapy is particularly important for the rare dogs with sterile struvite calculi without concomitant infection. Only those diets
specifically designed for long term feeding should be fed for prolonged periods.

MOLECULE

Calcium oxalate urolithiasis
Calcium oxalate uroliths do not respond to medical dissolution. Symptomatic calculi require
mechanical removal, after which preventative medical protocols should be implemented to prevent recurrence. Dogs predisposed to calcium oxalate urolithiasis may also benefit from a preventative diet (Figure 18).
> Prevention of recurrence

These uroliths have a high recurrence rate, up to 50% by 2 years after initial removal (Lulich et
al, 1995; 1998). Medical protocols are therefore essential to reduce urolith recurrence following
removal and dietary modification can greatly reduce the risk of recurrence in affected individuals
(Stevenson et al, 2004).
> Eliminate risk factors
One molecule of oxalate will
associate with one molecule of
calcium to form a very stable
molecule of calcium oxalate.

If the dog is hypercalcemic or has other diseases (e.g. hyperadrenocorticism), the underlying cause
should be corrected. Usually no further preventative measures will be required (Lulich et al, 1998).
If the dog is normocalcemic, risk factors for urolithiasis should be identified and controlled. Dry
acidifying diets that have not been formulated to increase diuresis and drugs that promote excessive urinary calcium excretion (urinary acidifiers, furosemide, glucocorticosteroids) should be avoided.

No treats or dietary supplements containing calcium, vitamin D or excessive amounts of vitamin

Calcium oxalate preventative diets should stimulate water consumption, and should not be restricted in protein, calcium or phosphorus. A recent clinical study has proven that dietary modification can reduce the risk factors associated with calcium oxalate formation thereby reducing the
risk of recurrence in susceptible individuals (Figure 19) (Stevenson et al, 2004).

7 - Specicific nutritional management

> Dietary modification

• Diuresis
Augmenting water intake, either by feeding a canned diet or by adding water and/or sodium chloride to the food, remains the major factor in managing and preventing calcium oxalate urolithiasis (Lulich et al, 1998; Lekcharoensuk et al, 2002b; Stevenson et al, 2003a, 2003b, Lulich et al, 2005).

• Sodium
Dry diets have been associated with a greater risk of stone formation (Lekcharoensuk et al, 2002a),
particularly if the diet is low in sodium chloride. This may be due to the fact that these diets do
not stimulate adequate diuresis, particularly in small-breed dogs that have been shown to eliminate smaller quantities of urine less frequently than large-breed dogs (Stevenson et al, 2001).
Research has shown that urinary calcium oxalate RSS, and therefore the risk of calcium oxalate
formation, can be significantly decreased by increasing the dietary sodium content from 0.06
g/100 kcal to 0.30 g/100 kcal (Stevenson et al, 2003a).

• Calcium and phosphorus
Recommendations for dietary calcium and phosphorus levels in calcium oxalate preventative diets
are changing. Previously it was advised to restrict dietary calcium and phosphorus, but recent studies suggest that this may actually promote calcium oxalate stone formation (Curhan et al, 1993;
Lekcharoensuk et al, 2002a, 2002b). Restriction of dietary calcium without concomitant reduction
in oxalate results in augmented intestinal absorption and urinary excretion of oxalate, which
increases the risk of urolithiasis (Lulich et al, 2000; Stevenson et al, 2003a). Dietary phosphorus restriction also increases calcium absorption (Lulich & Osborne, 1995). Consequently, calcium oxalate preventative diets should not be calcium or phosphorus restricted (Curhan et al, 1993, 1997).

• Protein
Urolithiasis

Dietary protein content is controversial. Previously it was recommended to lower protein content,
since protein could increase calcium excretion and reduce excretion of citrate (citrate chelates
calcium to form a soluble salt) (Lulich et al, 1995, 2000). However, studies indicate that higher
levels of dietary protein reduced the risk of urolithiasis (Lekcharoensuk et al, 2002a; 2002b). The
mechanism is unknown but may well be due to other factors, since high protein diets stimulate
diuresis and also contain more phosphorus and potassium.

• Urinary pH
Calcium oxalate crystals are generally not sensitive to urine pH, although pH affects the minerals
that co-precipitate with calcium oxalate (Robertson, 1993). Marked acidification that induces
metabolic acidosis can increase urinary calcium concentration to such extent that it promotes calcium oxalate stone formation (Lekcharoensuk et al, 2002a; 2002b). Marked alkalinization should
also be avoided since it promotes calcium phosphate urolithiasis. Diets resulting in mild acidification (pH 5.5-6.5) and increased diuresis may reduce the risk of both calcium oxalate and struvite crystal formation, useful in breeds predisposed to both stone types (Stevenson et al, 2002).
> Drug therapy

Adjunct medical therapy is used if there is persistence of calcium oxalate crystalluria or recurrence of urolithiasis.
Potassium citrate has been useful in humans to prevent recurrent calcium oxalate urolithiasis, via
its alkalinizing properties and by forming soluble salts with calcium.
Oral potassium citrate increases urine pH, which causes decreased tubular resorption of citrate,
thus increasing urinary citrate excretion. However, oral administration of up to 150 mg/kg/day did
not cause a consistent increase in urine citrate concentrations in healthy dogs, although it main301

7 - Specicific nutritional management

tained a higher urine pH later in the day (Stevenson et al, 2000). There was no difference between
wax matrix and powder supplements.
Hydrochlorothiazide (2-4 mg/kg orally BID) reduces urine calcium excretion, possibly by promoting mild volume contraction resulting in increased proximal tubular reabsorption of several
solutes, including calcium and sodium (Lulich et al, 2000). Its hypocalciuric effects may be helpful in minimizing recurrence of calcium oxalate urolith formation, especially when combined with
a urolith prevention diet (Lulich et al, 2001). However, long-term clinical studies are needed to
confirm safety and effectiveness of prolonged administration; it has the potential to cause hypokalemia, hypercalcemia and dehydration.
> Monitoring

Efficacy of therapy should initially be monitored with urinalysis (pH, specific gravity) every 2 to
4 weeks. With hydrochlorothiazide treatment serum electrolytes should also be checked. Imaging
every 6 to 12 months may help to detect any new uroliths when they are small enough to be removed non-invasively (e.g. voiding urohydropropulsion) (Lulich et al, 2000).

Urate urolithiasis
> Medical dissolution in dogs
without portosystemic shunts

The chief goal in dietary dissolution of urate uroliths in Dalmatian dogs is to raise urine pH and to
lower urine concentrations of uric acid, ammonium and/or hydrogen ions.
> Calculolytic diet

Urolithiasis

The dietary strategy aims at decreasing the purine content of the diet. This goal is achieved
through general protein restriction (18 to 10%). However, it is possible to design a low purine diet
without imposing a severe protein restriction if appropriate ingredients are selected. Fish or glandular organs, which are high in purine, should be avoided. Alternative protein sources that are
relatively low in purine precursors include: vegetable proteins, eggs and dairy products (Ling &
Sorenson, 1995). No other food supplements should be given. Low protein anti-uric acid diets may
contain insufficient protein to sustain growth and lactation. Experimental diets have been designed that could meet both requirements (Bijster et al, 2001). As with all urolith types, feeding a
canned diet, adding supplemental water to the food, or increasing the sodium content can help
to increase urinary volume. In addition, low-protein diets impair urinary concentrating capacity
by decreasing the medullary concentration gradient, due to the lower urea concentration in the
renal medulla.
> Alkalinization of urine

THE MEDICAL DISSOLUTION OF URATE

CALCULI INCLUDES A COMBINATION OF:

• feeding a low purine diet that has been designed
to dissolve urate calculi
• alkalinization of the urine
• increasing urine volume
• controlling urinary tract infections
• administering xanthine oxidase inhibitors
(allopurinol)

Alkaline urine contains low concentrations of ammonia and ammonium ions, and
thus decreases the risk of ammonium urate urolithiasis. Low-protein diets have an
alkalinizing effect, but it may be necessary to administer additional urine alkalinizing agents (Lulich et al, 2000). Sodium bicarbonate (25-50 mg/kg every 12 hours)
and potassium citrate (50-150 mg/kg every 12 hours) are used most commonly. The
dose should be individualized to maintain a urine pH of approximately 7.0. Urine
pH >7.5 should be avoided since this promotes formation of secondary calcium
phosphate deposits, which will hamper stone dissolution (Bartges et al, 1999).
> Xanthine oxidase inhibitors

Urinary urate excretion is lowered most effectively by using allopurinol, which is an inhibitor of
xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of xanthine and hypoxanthine to uric acid (Figure 20). As a result of allopurinol therapy, xanthine and hypoxanthine
concentrations in the urine increase, but urate decreases.
302

7 - Specicific nutritional management

Allopurinol should be given in conjunction with a low-purine diet, in order to minimize the risk
of xanthine stone formation (Ling et al, 1991; Bartges et al, 1999). The recommended dose for dissolution of urate uroliths is 15 mg/kg every 12 hours (Lulich et al, 2000). The dose must be reduced in patients with renal dysfunction, since allopurinol is excreted by the kidneys. A variety of
adverse effects, including skin rashes, GI upsets and hemolytic anemia, have been described in

humans, but these are rare in the dog. The most common adverse effect of allopurinol therapy in dogs is development of xanthine uroliths, either in pure form or
as an outer shell around pre-existing urate stones. Discontinuing allopurinol and
instituting a low-purine diet can sometimes dissolve xanthine uroliths (Ling et al,
1991).
> Monitoring

During dissolution the size of the urolith(s) must be periodically monitored by survey and/or double contrast radiography, or ultrasonography. Excretory urography
or ultrasonography are used to monitor dissolution of renal urate stones (Bartges et
al, 1999). Time required for dissolution is highly variable and can take between 4
and 40 weeks although average length of time in one study was 14 weeks (Bartges
et al 1999). Following removal or dissolution, urinalysis and ultrasonographic examination (or double contrast cystography) should be performed every 1 to 2
months for 6 months.

© F. Haymann

Even if uroliths do not reoccur the purine-restricted alkalinizing diet should be
continued. Follow-up examinations can then be extended to every 2 to 4 months,
and the intervals between examinations can be gradually increased.
> Medical dissolution in dogs with portosystemic shunts

Little is known about the biologic behavior of urate calculi following surgical correction of portosystemic shunts. When the urolith cannot be removed at the time
of shunt ligation, postsurgical medical dissolution should be considered. However,
more studies are needed to compare the relative value of calculolytic diet, alkalinization and/or allopurinol in dissolving ammonium urate uroliths in dogs with
portosystemic shunts.

In Dalmatian dogs, 82% of stones are urate stones
(Bartges et al, 1994).

303

7 - Specicific nutritional management

> Prevention

• Dalmatian dogs
Preventative treatment following removal or dissolution is important in Dalmatian dogs because
of their high risk for urate urolith recurrence. As a first choice, low-purine diets that promote the
formation of dilute alkaline urine should be fed. If urine pH is not consistently alkaline and/or
crystalluria persists, alkalinizing agents may be added. Preventative treatment with allopurinol is
not recommended routinely due to the risk of xanthine urolith formation, but it may be added to
the protocol if difficulties persist. Long-term allopurinol therapy is not recommended.
It is not necessary to feed purine-restricted diets to Dalmatian dogs that have not had urate urolithiasis. Acidifying high-protein diets that enhance excretion of ammonium ions should however be avoided as ammonium ions are likely to get linked to urate ions to from ammonium urate
crystals.

• Non-Dalmatian dogs
Recurrence of urate urolithiasis has been described in English bulldogs, and preventative measures
as discussed for Dalmatian dogs should be implemented (Bartges et al, 1999). Dogs fed protein-restricted diets (10 %) long-term may develop taurine deficiency, which might lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. Commercial protein-restricted diets are therefore now supplemented with taurine
(Sanderson et al, 2001a).

Cystine uroliths
> Medical dissolution

Urolithiasis

The aim of therapy is to reduce the concentration of cystine in the urine and to increase
cystine solubility. This usually requires dietary modification in combination with a thiolcontaining drug.
> Calculolytic diet

Reduction of dietary protein can reduce cystine excretion, presumably because these diets contain
fewer cystine precursors (Osborne et al, 1999g). However, the optimal degree of protein restriction
is controversial, since cystinuric dogs also excrete carnitine and therefore have the potential to
develop carnitine deficiency and dilated cardiomyopathy when fed low-protein diets. It is therefore recommended to supplement cystinuric dogs eating a protein-restricted diet with carnitine as
well as taurine (Sanderson et al, 2001b).
> Alkalinization of urine

CYSTINE UROLITHS CAN BE DISSOLVED MEDICALLY,
USING A COMBINATION OF:
• protein-restricted alkalinizing diet
• increasing urine volume
• alkalinization of urine (pH around 7.5)
• administration of thiol-containing drugs

304

The solubility of cystine is pH dependent. It is markedly more soluble
at urine pH of 7.5-7.8. Urine alkalinization may be achieved using a
commercial moderate to low-protein alkalinizing diet. If urine pH does
not become sufficiently alkaline on dietary therapy alone, additional
potassium citrate may be given to sustain a urine pH of approximately
7.5 (Osborne et al, 1999g). This has to done cautiously, since alkalinization can be a risk factor for calcium phosphate urolithiasis.

• Thiol-containing drugs
These drugs react with cystine by a thiol disulfide exchange reaction,
resulting in the formation of a complex that is more soluble in urine
than cystine. N-(2-mercaptopropionl)-glycine (2-MPG) is most commonly used, at a dose of 20 mg/kg twice daily orally. It has proven effec
tive in dissolving cystine uroliths, especially when used in conjunction
with a calculolytic diet (Lulich et al, 2000).

7 - Specicific nutritional management

Time for dissolution ranges from 1 to 3 months. Side-effects are relatively uncommon; aggression,
myopathy, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia have been reported, but signs resolved when the
treatment was stopped (Osborne et al, 1999g; Hoppe & Denneberg, 2001). D-penicillamine is an
older thiol-containing drug that has been used with some efficacy in the past, but it is no longer
used due to an unacceptable number of adverse effects, including frequent hypersensitivity reactions.
> Monitoring

Urolith dissolution should be monitored at 30-day intervals by urinalysis (pH, specific gravity, sediment) and serial radiography to evaluate stone location, number, size, density and shape. Contrast
radiography may be used for radiolucent stones. The calculolytic diet, 2-MPG and alkalinizing
therapy should be continued for at least one month following radiographic disappearance of uroliths.
> Prevention

Preventative therapy is important, because cystinuria is an inherited metabolic defect and because
cystine uroliths recur in most stone-forming dogs within 12 months following surgical removal. Recurrence is more likely to occur if the dog excretes large amounts of cystine. A moderate to low-protein
diet that promotes formation of alkaline urine can be effective in preventing cystine urolith recurrence in dogs with low to moderate cystinuria. If necessary, dietary therapy may be combined with
alkalinzation therapy to increase urinary pH and prevent cystine urolithiasis (Hoppe et al, 1993; Hoppe
& Denneberg, 2001).
Treatment should be titrated to maintain a negative urine cyanide-nitroprusside test. The severity of
cystinuria may decline with advancing age in some dogs; consequently, the dose of 2-MPG may be
decreased or even stopped (Hoppe & Denneberg, 2001).

Calcium phosphate urolithiasis
Urolithiasis

> Medical dissolution

• Underlying metabolic disease
Calcium phosphate uroliths may rarely dissolve spontaneously following parathyroidectomy for
treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. If stones are clinically silent, one might wait for this
to occur before contemplating surgical or non-surgical removal. Medical dissolution is not effective in distal renal tubular acidosis.

• Idiopathic uroliths
If a specific underlying disorder is not diagnosed, calcium phosphate uroliths are removed surgically and then managed as for calcium oxalate urolithiasis (Lulich et al, 2000).
> Prevention

Recognition and management of underlying contributing conditions is the first and most important step in the prevention of calcium phosphate urolithiasis. The patient should be assessed for
evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, excessive urine concentrations of calcium and/or phosphate, and inappropriately alkaline urine pH. There may also be a previous history of dietary therapy and administration of alkalinizing agents to prevent another urolith type.

Calcium phosphate uroliths cannot
be medically dissolved, and surgical
removal is usually necessary.
Correction of underlying metabolic
abnormalities may minimize
recurrence. If no underlying cause
is found, management is similar
to that of calcium oxalate
urolithiasis.

If a specific underlying disorder is not diagnosed, calcium phosphate uroliths are generally managed similar to strategies used for calcium oxalate urolithiasis (Lulich et al, 2000). One should however be careful to avoid excessive urine alkalinization, which may occur with some diets used for
prevention of calcium oxalate uroliths.

305

Conclusion

Silica urolithiasis
> Prevention

Because the initiating and precipitating causes of silica urolithiasis are not well known, only nonspecific recommendations are available.
Silica uroliths may occur in dogs with pica (i.e. eating soil) or in dogs eating diets high in cereal
grains containing silicates. Empiric recommendations are to change the diet to one with high quality protein and if possible reduced quantities of non nutritive plant ingredients (Osborne et al,
1999a).
As with all uroliths, increased water intake should be promoted to decrease the resulting concentration of calculogenic material in urine.

Compound uroliths
Dissolution of compound uroliths should theoretically be aimed at implementing subsequent protocols for dissolving the various layers of the urolith, starting with the outer layer. In practice, most
compound uroliths are removed surgically or by other non-surgical means. The post-removal strategy is generally aimed at preventing the reformation of the mineral that composed the core of
the removed urolith, since the outer layer(s) were probably deposited secondarily due to heterogeneous nucleation (Osborne et al, 1999c).

Urolithiasis

Conclusion

Following removal of compound
(mixed) uroliths, medical dissolution
strategies are usually based on
preventing the reformation of the
mineral that composed the core
of the compound urolith.

Dietary modification is an important part of the management regimen for struvite urolithiasis.
Diet influences the saturation of urine with struvite as it impacts urine pH, volume and solute
concentration. Urine pH is the most important factor controlling struvite saturation. Reduction
of urine pH through dietary manipulation is thus likely to be the most reliable means of achieving urine which is undersaturated with struvite. Restriction of dietary crystalloid intake may also
be beneficial, although changes in urinary magnesium or phosphate concentration individually,
have much less impact on struvite saturation than changing urine pH.
The goal of dietary management for calcium oxalate urolithiasis is to create urine that has a low
saturation with calcium oxalate. Ideally, urine should be undersaturated as new crystal formation
cannot occur under these circumstances; however, this may be difficult to achieve in some
patients. Homogeneous crystal formation will not occur, and heterogeneous crystal formation is
unlikely to occur, in the lower part of the metastable zone of supersaturation. Therefore this represents a reasonable target that should reduce the risk of recurrence in patients.
Enhancing urine volume for a given solute load will also reduce saturation, as it will decrease the
concentrations of crystalloids. In addition, increasing urine volume may influence crystal transit
time through the urinary tract, thus reducing the potential for crystal growth.

Q

A

A dog with signs of cystitis has
cystic calculi on abdominal
radiography.
What is the next approach?

(1) Culture the urine to look for UTI. Primary UTI may predispose to struvite urolithiasis, and
other stones may result in a secondary UTI resulting in a struvite shell around the primary stone.
Treatment of the UTI will be helpful in both situations.
(2) Assessment of the type of crystals in the urine may help to suspect which stones are present.
(3) Spontaneous voiding, aspiration through a urethral catheter, voiding urohydropropulsion or
surgical removal will identify the stone type, enabling specific therapy.
Note: urate and cystine stones are usually radiolucent, and require positive contrast studies or
ultrasound for demonstration. They are therefore less likely when stones are radiographically
visible.

How do I treat renal calculi?

Nephroliths are generally treated by surgical removal, although medical dissolution may be possible for struvite uroliths. Lithotripsy may be available in some cases. Benign neglect is possible
in uninfected and non-obstructing nephroliths.

First, find out what the composition of the stones is. Calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate and
silica uroliths cannot be dissolved medically and need to be surgically removed before protocols
to prevent recurrence are implemented. Adjunctive medical management is indicated when
UTI is present, the urolith type is poorly amenable to dietary changes, or when there is further
urolith growth.

How do I handle a dog with
struvite calculi?

Struvite uroliths are generally sensitive to medical dissolution using a calculolytic diet in
association with antibiotic therapy. Commercial calculolytic diets are aimed to acidify and to
reduce urine concentrations of urea, phosphorus and magnesium. They should be given for at
least one month after removal or dissolution of struvite uroliths, because uroliths too small for
radiographic detection may still be present. Dogs can then be changed to a normal diet.
Urinary acidifying agents such as ammonium chloride are not necessary provided a calculolytic
diet and antimicrobials are given.

What diet should I feed
to a dog after surgery for
calcium oxalate uroliths?

Calcium uroliths have a high incidence of recurrence, so preventative therapy is important.
First, identify and treat any underlying causes that may have contributed to calcium urolithiasis, such as hyperparathyroidism and hyperadrenocorticism. Subsequently risk factors should be
minimized by dietary adaptation. It will help to feed wet diets or special sodium-enriched dry
diets that promote diuresis, and to avoid drugs that promote calciuresis, e.g. furosemide and urinary acidifiers. The diet should contain normal levels of protein, calcium and phosphorus.

How to manage a Dalmatian dog
with suspected ammonium urate
urolithiasis?

Since this is a Dalmatian, the most likely diagnosis is ammonium urate stones. A presumptive
diagnosis can be achieved by looking for urate crystals in the urine. As a first choice, lowpurine diets (e.g. vegetables, eggs and dairy products) that promote the formation of dilute
alkaline urine should be fed. As with all urolith types, feeding a canned diet or adding supplemental water to the food helps to increase urinary volume. Allopurinol therapy will help to
further reduce urinary urate excretion.

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

The small breeds (Shih Tzu, Yorkshire Terrier, Miniature
Schnauzer, Pekingese) are among the breeds of dog at
most risk of urolithiasis.

Key Points
to remember:

Urolithiasis

The role of nutrition in the treatment
and prevention of canine urolithiasis
Stimulation
of water intake
and diuresis
For all stone types, encouraging
the dog to drink to promote the
production of dilute urine is an
essential part of preventing stone
formation. Diluting the urine
limits the concentration of the
crystal precursors in the urine.
There are three simple ways to
encourage water intake: selecting
a wet food, hydrating dry food
before serving, and slightly increasing the food’s sodium content. A
dietary sodium content of 3.2 g
/1000 kcal does not have any effect
on blood pressure in a healthy dog
or a dog with moderate renal
pathology.

Urinary pH
Acidifying the urine is the best
method to lower urinary struvite

312

saturation and therefore to prevent this type of urinary stone.
Struvite stones are highly soluble
in acid pH, so acidification will
even help to dissolve the stones.
Calcium oxalate stones are not
sensitive to urinary pH. Urinary
alkalinization indirectly limits the
presence of precursors in the urine
(by limiting the calciuria and promoting the excretion of citrate,
which forms a soluble salt with calcium), but at the same time it
increases the risk of struvite formation. It is preferable to combine
increased diuresis with a moderate
pH (6-6.5) to simultaneously prevent the appearance of both oxalate and struvite stones.
Conversely, for both cystine and
urate urolithiasis it is necessary to
achieve a more alkaline pH
(around 7) to increase the solubility of these stones. However, alkalinizing the urine further increases

the risk of secondary calcium phosphate urolithiasis.

Proteins
Protein restriction has been recommended to help manage both
urate and cystine urolithiasis. In
particular, dogs predisposed to
urate stones (Dalmatians, English
Bulldogs) need a diet that is low in
purines, without necessarily reducing the overall protein ingested.
These two goals are compatible
when a protein source that is low
in purine content is selected.
If protein restriction is implemented to assist the management of
cystine stones, the diet should be
supplemented with taurine and Lcarnitine to help prevent the risk
of dilated cardiomyopathy.

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

Focus on:

SODIUM

- It maintains the balance in osmotic pressure between the intra- and
extra-cellular environments thus
regulating the volume of extra-cel-

WHAT IS THE SODIUM
CONTENT IN THE VARIOUS
SODIUM SALTS?

- It is involved in acid base balance
- It participates in nerve transmission
The digestive absorption of
sodium is very important. The
maintenance of a constant sodium
level in the organism is based on
regulation of both renal and intestinal excretion. Dogs do not sweat,
hence they are not at risk of excessive sodium loss.

- Sodium chloride (NaCl) contains 39%
sodium.
1% sodium in a food therefore
corresponds to approximately:
1 / 0.39 = 2.5% NaCl.
- Sodium carbonate contains 37% sodium.
- Sodium bicarbonate contains 27%
sodium.

Urolithiasis

Sodium plays several essential
roles in the function of the cell:

lular fluids. This function of water
balance regulation gives sodium
an important role in the sense of
hunger and micturition.

© Éric Berchotteau

After calcium and potassium,
sodium is the most abundant ion
in the organism. It represents
around 0.13% of the body weight
of a mammal. Extracellular sodium
is found in the skeleton (43% of
total sodium), the interstitial fluid
(29%) and the plasma (12%). The
remaining body sodium is located
intracellularly.

1 • Is blood pressure affected by high dietary salt content?
In dogs, increasing the sodium
content in the food has a clear role
in stimulating diuresis and lowering the urinary calcium oxalate
saturation. The relationship between the salt content in human
food and hypertension is a subject
of intense debate, hence the question of the influence of salt (NaCl)
on canine blood pressure is a logical one to ask.

Vienna University in association
with Royal Canin studied the development of blood pressure based
on the dietary NaCl content (Biourge
et al, 2002).
Eight healthy female Beagles age 2
to 4 years were divided into two
groups and fed for two weeks with
the same dry (acidified) food. The
only difference between the two
diets was the NaCl content:

- the control diet contained:
0.38% Na and 1.40% Cl
- the NaCl-enriched diet contained:
0.96% Na and 2.40% Cl (DMB).
The two groups consumed the two
formulations in turn, with a oneweek transition period during
which they were fed a standard
maintenance food.

The results of this study clearly
demonstrated that moderate enrichment of NaCl in the diet increased
urine volume (p<0.001) but did not
alter blood pressure of healthy dogs
when compared with a standard
food. The blood pressure values

observed are within the normal
reference range (<160 mm Hg).
Four other studies have also failed
to provide any evidence that mode-

rate increases in dietary sodium (up
to 3.2 g Na/1000 kcal) influences the
blood pressure of dogs and cats, be
they healthy or moderate renal
disease patients (Burankarl et al, 2003;
Greco et al, 1994; Kirk 2002; Luckschander
et al, 2002).

The National Research Council
Committee on Animal Nutrition
(NRC) has been tasked with establishing nutritional requirements for

the dog and cat by the U.S.
Academy of Sciences. Their latest
recommendations indicate that
there is no adverse health risk for
the dog when the sodium content
of
the
diet
contains
3.75 g /1000 kcal in a dry food providing 4000 kcal/kg. This is equivalent to a sodium content of 1.5%.

any scientific advances have improved our knowledge of
cardiac disease and congestive heart failure (CHF) in dogs.
In addition to new cardiac medications, recent advances have
improved our understanding of nutritional interventions and
nutritional pharmacology. Cardiovascular disease is still one of
the most common life-threatening disorders in dogs. Most canine
cardiac diseases cannot be cured and the disease process is
typically progressive, leading to advanced CHF or lethal cardiac
arrhythmias. Nutritional interventions for cardiac disease
remain one of the mainstays of therapy and one of the more
exciting avenues for further scientific investigation.

316

1 - Epidemiology

1 - Epidemiology
Many risk factors and clinical associations have been identified for cardiovascular disorders in
dogs. Breed predispositions are recognized for most of the common cardiovascular diseases (Table
1). Many small to medium sized dog breeds are predisposed to acquired chronic valvular disease
(CVD; endocardiosis), while dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and pericardial disease are the most
common causes of congestive heart failure (CHF) in large breed dogs.
Certain cardiovascular disorders are recognized to have a sex predisposition; for example, female
dogs are predisposed to patent ductus arteriosus and male dogs are predisposed to CVD, idiopathic pericardial disease, and bacterial endocarditis.
Dogs with renal or adrenal disease can develop systemic hypertension and this can predispose or
contribute to existing cardiac disease.

2 - Diagnosis of canine cardiac disease
Congenital and acquired cardiac diseases often lead to similar compensatory responses and neuroendocrine activation. Due to the similarities in response of the heart, systemic and pulmonary vasculature and the neuroendocrine systems, several common historical findings and clinical signs result from
most of the canine cardiovascular diseases.

TABLE 2 - COMMON HISTORICAL
FINDINGS IN DOGS WITH
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE

Common historical complaints include cough, shortness of breath, and syncope (Table 2). Cardiac disease can be quite advanced when the owner is first able to detect clinical abnormality,
however many cardiac diseases can be detected by the attending veterinarian well in advance of
the development of clinical signs.
Most congenital cardiac diseases are accompanied by a loud cardiac murmur. The most common
form of cardiovascular disease in the dog, CVD, typically has a cardiac murmur that can be readily identified well before outward clinical signs of cardiovascular disease are evident. The abnormalities that are most commonly identified on physical examination from dogs with cardiovascular disease are listed in Table 3.

- Coughing
- Gagging
- Shortness of breath or difficulty
breathing
- Inability to sleep comfortably through
the night
- Fainting or "seizure" (syncope)
- Weight loss
- Abdominal distension
- Weakness
- Exercise intolerance
- Poor growth (congenital heart disease)

Diagnostic tests
FIGURE 1 - ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY INDICATING DILATED
CARDIOMYOPATHY IN A BOXER

Once cardiovascular disease is established as a differential diagnosis, a battery of routine tests are often performed to confirm
cardiovascular disease, establish the severity of disease, and
permit an informed decision to be made regarding treatment.
An electrocardiogram should be performed in all dogs with
evidence of cardiac arrhythmia, including those with arrhythmia noted on cardiac auscultation and those with femoral
arterial pulse deficits, bradycardia, tachycardia, or a history of
syncope, seizure, or collapse.

Thoracic radiographs are indicated to establish whether CHF
is present and to help determine the degree of cardiac enlargement, the size of the pulmonary vessels, and the size of the
caudal vena cava. Thoracic radiographs are the best diagnostic test to exclude respiratory diseases as either the cause or a
contributor to the animal’s clinical signs. For many cardiovascular diseases, echocardiography is the key diagnostic test to
establish the exact cause of the disease. Echocardiography also
facilitates the evaluation of cardiac chamber enlargement and
permits quantitative evaluation of cardiac chamber size, wall
thickness, and myocardial and valve function (Figure 1).

Dilated cardiomyopathy may be
associated with taurine deficiency in
certain breeds, such as the Golden
Retriever, the Newfoundland and
the Cocker Spaniel.

In dogs with congenital disease, echocardiography is used to
confirm the type of defect, establish the severity of the defect,
and is an invaluable aid in offering therapeutic and prognostic advice. Echocardiography is a key tool for the diagnosis and
management of cardiac disease and should be offered in all
cases where serious cardiovascular disease is a differential diagnosis.

Heart

Many additional tests are useful in the diagnosis and management of dogs with cardiac disease.
- Heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) antigen testing should be
carried out in dogs from endemic areas.
- A complete blood count and biochemistry profile should be
carried out to search for concurrent diseases and establish
baseline values prior to therapy. Alterations in blood urea
nitrogen, creatinine, and the serum electrolytes sodium,
potassium, chloride and magnesium can develop following
the initiation of various cardiac medications, and knowledge of these alterations is useful in selecting or altering the diet.
- Plasma and whole blood taurine levels may be indicated in
dogs with evidence of reduced systolic function on echocardiography, especially in certain breeds of dogs (e.g. Cocker
Spaniel, Golden Retriever, Newfoundland) and in dogs
consuming certain diets (see below).
- Measurement of systemic blood pressure is useful to exclude systemic hypertension as a contributing factor to the cardiovascular disease. In addition, when hypotension develops following
initiation of pharmacologic therapy, a baseline blood pressure measurement can be used for comparison.
- A variety of additional specialized cardiovascular tests, such as Holter monitor recorders, event
monitor recorders, computed tomography, phonocardiography, and cardiac catheterization are
available for specific clinical settings.

3 - Treatment of cardiac disease

3 - Treatment of cardiac disease
It is beyond the scope of this chapter to mention the appropriate treatment for each cardiovascular disease recognized in dogs and the reader is referred to the many excellent textbooks on specific pharmacologic or surgical treatments (Kittleson & Kienle, 1998; Fox et al, 1999; Kittleson,
2000; Sisson et al, 2000a; Ware & Keene, 2000). Common cardiovascular medications include
furosemide, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, digoxin, positive inotropes, betablockers, antiarrhythmic drugs, and additional diuretics such as thiazide diuretics and aldosterone receptor blockers (eg, spironolactone). Medications used in an individual patient can impact
appropriate diet selection (see below).
In general, dietary management of dogs with cardiac disease depends upon the clinical signs and
stage of heart failure, rather than the underlying disorder. Therefore, the dietary management of
a dog with CHF secondary to ventricular septal defect or bacterial endocarditis would be similar
to that of a dog with CVD and CHF. When selecting a diet for a dog with cardiac disease, clinicians should take into consideration a number of factors including clinical signs and laboratory
parameters. Another important issue to consider is the dog's stage of disease. In the face of acute
CHF, the initial goal should be to titrate medication doses and to get the dog stabilized. In a dog
with pulmonary edema or pleural effusion, the only diet change routinely advised during the initial period or even when first discharging the dog is to limit intake of very high sodium diets or
high sodium treats. Once the dog is home and stabilized on medications, a gradual change to a
new diet can be made - usually at the time of the first recheck 7-10 days after discharge. Forced
dietary changes when the animal is sick or starting new medications may induce food aversions.

Heart

Failure to respond to pharmacologic and nutritional therapies can be the result of advanced or
progressive disease, drug side effects, or incorrect diagnosis. Common pitfalls in the treatment of
dogs with cardiac disease are shown in Table 4.

TABLE 4 - COMMON PITFALLS IN THE TREATMENT OF DOGS WITH CARDIAC DISEASE
Older small breed dogs with a
cardiac murmur often have
concurrent respiratory disease
and it can be difficult to
determine whether the clinical
signs result from respiratory
or cardiac disease
Thoracic radiographs should always
be obtained prior to initiation of
diuretics and other cardiac
medications.

320

Large breed dogs with acquired
cardiac disease often have either
dilated cardiomyopathy or
pericardial disease
Since both of these diseases
can occur without significant
abnormalities on cardiac
auscultation, there may be a delay
in accurate diagnosis unless
one maintains a high degree of
suspicion for these diseases.

Failure to accept a new diet
Causes can include abrupt change,
particularly if the diet is introduced
at the same time that drug
interventions are being introduced
or adjusted.

Anorexia
Both congestive heart failure and
drug side effects can lead to
anorexia. Failure to eat a cardiac
diet is too often attributed to lack
of palatability for the diet rather
than consideration of the many other
factors that might impact appetite.

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

4 - Pathophysiology and specific
issues of nutritional management
In addition to medications, optimal treatment of dogs with cardiac disease also includes careful
attention to the diet. Although sodium restriction is the nutritional modification most often
thought of for dogs with cardiac disease (and sometimes is the only nutrient modification thought
of), adjustment of a variety of nutrients may be beneficial for these animals. Research is now beginning to show that dietary factors may be able to modulate canine cardiac disease, either by slowing the progression, minimizing the number of medications required, improving quality of life,
or in rare cases, actually curing the disease.
In the past, the goal of nutritional management for animals with cardiac disease was purely symptomatic. This was primarily due to the limited number of medications available for treatment, and
in that situation, severe sodium restriction was beneficial for reducing fluid accumulation in animals with CHF. Now, with more effective medications available for use in dogs, severe sodium restriction is not critical in most dogs. The emphasis in the nutritional management of dogs with
CHF is on providing the optimal number of calories for the individual patient, avoiding nutritional deficiencies and excesses, and gaining potential beneficial effects from pharmacologic doses of
certain nutrients.

Optimal weight maintenance
Both weight loss and obesity can be problems in animals with cardiac disease, and can adversely
affect the dog’s health.
> Cardiac cachexia

Heart

Dogs with CHF commonly demonstrate weight loss, termed cardiac cachexia (Figure 2). This
weight loss in animals with CHF is unlike that seen in a healthy dog that loses weight. In a healthy animal that is receiving insufficient calories to meet requirements (eg, a starving dog, a dog
on a weight reduction diet), fat serves as the primary energy source and this helps to preserve lean
body mass. In a dog with injury or illness, including CHF, amino acids from muscle are the primary source of energy, resulting in loss of lean body mass.
FIGURE 2 - CARDIAC CACHEXIA IN DOGS WITH CHF

a: Cardiac cachexia is often viewed as an end-stage situation like
the dog shown here with severe dilated cardiomyopathy and
congestive heart failure.

b: Cardiac cachexia is actually a process during which lean
body mass is gradually lost. Cachexia can be very subtle initially
and may be manifested only by mild muscle loss over the epaxial
and gluteal muscles.

321

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

Therefore, a loss of lean body mass is the hallmark of cachexia. There is a spectrum of severity of
cachexia and the term does not necessarily equate with an emaciated, end-stage patient (Figures
3 & 4). In the early stages, it can be very subtle and may even occur in obese dogs (i.e. a dog may
have excess fat stores but still lose lean body mass). Loss of lean body mass is usually first noted in
the epaxial, gluteal, scapular, or temporal muscles. Cardiac cachexia typically does not occur until
CHF has developed.

Adaptation to fat utilisation

There is a dramatic difference between simple starvation, which occurs in a healthy animal and
cachexia, the weight loss seen in animals with cardiac disease. A healthy animal will primarily
lose fat tissue, whereas cachexia is distinguished by a loss of lean body mass.

Cardiac cachexia can occur with any underlying cause of CHF (eg, DCM, CVD, congenital heart
diseases) but most commonly occurs in dogs with DCM, particularly those with right-sided CHF.
In one study of dogs with DCM, over 50% of patients had some degree of cachexia (Freeman et
al, 1998). Loss of lean body mass has deleterious effects on strength, immune function, and survival, so it is important to recognize cachexia at an early stage to explore opportunities to manage it effectively (Freeman & Roubenoff, 1994).
The loss of lean body mass in cardiac cachexia is a multifactorial process caused by anorexia,
increased energy requirements, and metabolic alterations (Freeman & Roubenoff, 1994). The anorexia may be secondary to the fatigue or dyspnea or may be due to medication toxicity or feeding
an unpalatable diet. Anorexia is present in 34-75% of dogs with cardiac disease (Mallery et al,
1999; Freeman et al, 2003b). Although not yet measured in dogs with CHF, energy requirements
up to 30% above normal have been documented in people with CHF (Poehlman et al, 1994).

(d) Marked muscle wasting is present in
this dog, as evidenced by the atrophy of all

(e) Severe muscle wasting can readily
be seen in this dog (Cachexia score= 4).

Nutritional management of dogs with cardiac cachexia
consists primarily of providing adequate calories and protein
and modulating cytokine production.

While these factors play a role in the loss of lean body
mass, a major factor in this syndrome is an increased production of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Freeman et
al, 1998; Meurs et al, 2002). These inflammatory cytokines are known to directly cause anorexia, to increase
energy requirements, and to increase the catabolism of
lean body mass. Of particular pertinence to cardiac disease, TNF and IL-1 also cause cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis and have negative inotropic effects
(Figure 5).

in all muscle groups, is present. Note

Anorexia can be detrimental to the dog with CHF in more
than one way. Anorexia can be deleterious because it contributes to the syndrome of cardiac cachexia but, in addition, anorexia is one of the most common factors that contribute to a dog owner's decision of euthanasia. In one study of owners of dogs euthanized
for CHF, anorexia was one of the most common contributing factors to the euthanasia decision (Mallery et al, 1999). Anorexia is more common in dogs with CHF compared to asymptomatic dogs, and
it also is more common in dogs with DCM compared to dogs with CVD (Freeman et al, 2003b).
One of the most important issues for managing anorexia is to maintain optimal medical control of CHF.
An early sign of worsening CHF is a reduction in food intake in a dog that has previously been eating
well. Another possible cause of decreased appetite is the side effects of medications. Digoxin toxicity
or azotemia secondary to ACE inhibitors or overzealous diuretic use can both cause anorexia. Ensuring
a diet that is palatable to the dog while maintaining other nutritional goals is key to minimizing the

effects of cachexia in dogs with CHF. Tips that may assist in food intake include feeding small, more
frequent meals or warming the food to body temperature (or for some dogs, feeding refrigerated food
increases appetite). Gradual introduction of a more palatable diet may be beneficial for some dogs (e.g.,
switching from a dry food to a canned food, changing to a different brand, or having a veterinary nutritionist formulate a balanced homemade diet). It also may be useful to use flavor enhancers to increase food intake (e.g., yogurt, maple syrup, or honey) (Figure 6).
Modulation of cytokine production can also be beneficial for managing cardiac cachexia. Although
specific anti-TNF agents have not proven to be beneficial for people with CHF, dietary supplementation may be a safer method of reducing inflammatory cytokines. One method of decreasing the production and effects of cytokines is with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation (see discussion
of n-3 fatty acids below). Supplementation of fish oil, which is high in n-3 fatty acids, can decrease
cytokine production in dogs with CHF and improve cachexia (Freeman et al, 1998). A reduction of
IL-1 has been correlated with survival in dogs with CHF (Freeman et al, 1998).
Optimal medical and nutritional therapy can help to reverse cachexia and improve nutritional status.
Nutritional status is difficult to measure objectively in the ill patients but one parameter that can be
evaluated is insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). In people and in dogs, IGF-1 concentrations have
been used as an indicator of nutritional status (Clark et al, 1996; Maxwell et al, 1998). Mean IGF-1
concentrations have been shown to be positively correlated with survival, suggesting that maintaining
good nutritional status may be able to improve survival (Freeman et al, 1998). In people with CHF,
the presence of cachexia has proven to be a poor prognostic indicator (Anker et al, 2003; Davos et al,
2003).
> Obesity

Although many dogs, particularly those with more advanced cardiac disease, have weight and
muscle loss, some dogs with cardiac disease are overweight or obese (Figure 7). Although cardiac
implications of obesity have not been well-studied in dogs and coronary artery disease is not a
324

Weight reduction programs are a difficult and often frustrating endeavor. For information on obesity and weight reduction programs, see Chapter 1. However, one advantage when a dog has cardiac disease is that there is automatically an increased incentive for the owner to commit to a
weight reduction plan. Although this may not ensure success, it aids in the first step of successful
weight loss.
As with any weight reduction program, it is critical to perform a careful dietary history to determine and control all sources of caloric intake. This diet history is also beneficial in finding other
food sources for the dog that may be contributing both calories and sodium. Typically, the pet food
is only one source of calories for the pet and as many, or more, calories may be consumed from
treats and table food. In one study of dogs with cardiac disease, calorie intake from treats and table
food ranged from 0-100%, with a median calorie intake from treats of 19% (Freeman et al, 2003b).
Therefore, it is important to recommend specific treats that are reduced in both calories and
sodium. Fresh non-starchy vegetables (or frozen/canned forms that are labeled as, “no salt added”)
are excellent low calorie treats for dogs that are obese and have cardiac disease.

Figure 7 - A dog with chronic
valvular disease complicated by
severe obesity. Obesity may exacerbate
the disease. Owners of obese dogs with
cardiac disease often report that, when
the dog loses weight, it acts less dyspneic
and more active.

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

major concern in dogs, obesity is thought to be deleterious in dogs with cardiac disease because of
its documented adverse effects on cardiac output, pulmonary function, neurohumoral activation,
blood pressure, and heart rate in people and in experimental animal models (Alexander, 1986).
In any obese dog, underlying endocrine diseases such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's disease
should be ruled out, but most obese animals simply suffer from excess consumption of calories.

If possible, an exercise program will help with the weight reduction program but, for dogs with
CHF in which exercise restriction is recommended, this is not possible. For these dogs, the weight
reduction program must rely on control of calorie intake.

Preventing nutrient excesses
FIGURE 8 - PATHOGENESIS OF SODIUM RETENTION
IN HEART DISEASE

> Sodium and chloride

A prime example is sodium restriction. Healthy dogs
can easily excrete excess dietary sodium in the urine
but, even before clinical signs become apparent in
dogs with cardiac disease, there is activation of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system and
abnormal excretion of sodium (Figure 8) (Barger et
al, 1955). Based on this pathophysiologic change,
sodium restriction has been a mainstay of therapy for
dogs with cardiac disease for nearly 50 years. However, very few studies have been conducted on dietary sodium in dogs with cardiac disease. Many questions remain on the specific intake of sodium recommended for dogs with different stages of disease, at
what stage sodium restriction should be instituted,
and if there are any detrimental effects of sodium restriction.

Veterinarians have extrapolated from the human

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

• Normal dogs
Healthy dogs are relatively tolerant toward the sodium content of their diet.
An early study in 1964 showed no significant changes in extracellular water, sodium, or chloride
in normal dogs fed a low sodium diet (Pensinger, 1964). This study also showed that healthy dogs
were able to maintain sodium and potassium balance on both low and high sodium diets.
Two other studies found that normal dogs fed a low sodium diet had no changes in plasma sodium,
chloride, or extracellular fluid volume compared to those fed a high sodium diet (Hamlin et al,
1964; Morris et al, 1976). In 1994, a study examined the effects of a low sodium diet and furosemide in healthy dogs with or without captopril (Roudebush et al, 1994). Although there were no
within-group changes in electrolytes in this study, 3 of 6 dogs became hyperkalemic while receiving a low sodium diet plus furosemide and 2 of 6 became hyperkalemic while receiving a low
sodium diet plus furosemide and captopril (Roudebush et al, 1994). The effects of the low sodium
diet alone were not reported.
In normal dogs, low sodium diets caused an increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma
aldosterone concentration compared to a high sodium diet, although plasma concentrations of
ACE, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and endothelin-1 (ET-1)
remained unchanged (Pedersen et al, 1994a, Pedersen et al, 1994b). Normal dogs receiving enalapril while eating a low-sodium diet, however, had an exaggerated increase in PRA and a larger
decrease in ACE and ANP compared to a dogs eating a high sodium diet (Koch et al, 1994). These
investigators also found an inverse correlation between PRA and sodium content of the diet (Koch
et al, 1994).

• Dogs with CHF

Heart

Dogs with CHF respond differently to dietary sodium restriction. Sodium restriction is one
method, along with the use of diuretics and venous vasodilators, to treat excessive increases in
preload in patients with CHF. In the 1960's, when few medications were available for treating
dogs with CHF, dietary sodium restriction was one of the few methods of reducing fluid accumulation. In this situation, severe sodium restriction clearly was beneficial in reducing signs of congestion.
In one study, dogs with CHF retained sodium on the high sodium diet but did not retain sodium
on the low sodium diet (Pensinger, 1964). Untreated dogs with mild, asymptomatic mitral valve
insufficiency had a larger increase in PRA and PAC and a lower ACE activity when changed from
a high sodium diet to a low sodium diet (Pedersen, 1996). Sodium intake had no effect on endothelin-1, ANP, and AVP (Pedersen, 1996).
A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of low sodium diets in dogs with CHF
secondary to either CVD or DCM demonstrated no significant changes in neurohormones between a low sodium and moderate sodium diet (Rush et al, 2000). Serum sodium and chloride
concentrations decreased significantly while dogs were eating the low sodium diet (Rush et al,
2000). Measures of cardiac size decreased significantly on the low sodium diet compared to the
moderate sodium diet, especially in dogs with endocardiosis (Rush et al, 2000). The effects of a
low sodium diet on survival were not tested.
The biggest gap in the issue of sodium restriction is for dogs with early cardiac disease [Stage I or
II: Table 5] (International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council (ISACHC), 2001). Based on
the pathogenesis of sodium retention, authors in the 1960's recommended institution of lowsodium diets for dogs when a heart murmur was first detected, even before clinical signs were present (Morris, 1976). Only recently have the benefits and potential problems been questioned. One
of the earliest and major compensatory responses in cardiac disease is activation of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system. Sodium restriction can further activate the RAA system
(Pedersen et al, 1994a-1994b; Koch et al, 1994).

1a Signs of heart disease are present but no signs of
compensation, such as volume or pressure overload
or ventricular hypertrophy, are evident.

Severe sodium restriction is not required.
Counsel the owner to avoid diets high in sodium
(>100 mg/100 kcal) and to avoid treats and table

2 Mild to Moderate Heart Failure
Clinical signs of heart failure are evident at
rest or with mild exercise and adversely affect
quality of life. Typical signs of heart failure
include exercise intolerance, cough, tachypnea,
mild respiratory distress (dyspnea), and mild
to moderate ascites. Hypoperfusion at rest
is generally not present.

3 Advanced Heart Failure
Clinical signs of advanced congestive heart
failure are immediately obvious. These clinical
signs include respiratory distress (dyspnea),
marked ascites, profound exercise intolerance,
or hypoperfusion at rest.

Sodium content of 50-80 mg/100 kcal in the main
diet.
Greater sodium restriction (<50 mg/100 kcal) is
recommended if large diuretic doses are necessary to
control clinical signs.
Limiting sodium intake from treats and table foods
becomes more important.
Counsel owner on appropriate methods for

3b Hospitalization is mandatory because cardiogenic
shock, life-threatening pulmonary edema, refractory
ascites, or a large pleural effusion is present.

Stabilization of acute CHF should be the goal. Diet
changes should be avoided until the dog is home and
stabilized on medications; a gradual change
to a new diet can be instituted at that time.

Dietary sodium recommendations

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

TABLE 5 - DIETARY SODIUM RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DOGS BASED ON STAGE OF DISEASE

Note that these recommendations assume that the dog is not eating high sodium treats, table foods,
or foods used for medication administration in addition to the main diet. If dogs are eating high
sodium foods in addition to the main diet, the owner should be counselled regarding these foods
or a diet lower in sodium should be selected.
*From: International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council.

Thus, severe sodium restriction in dogs with early cardiac disease could theoretically be detrimental by early and excessive activation of the RAA system. Studies by Pensinger showed that dogs
with cardiac disease but without CHF were able to maintain sodium and potassium balance on
both low and high sodium diets, similar to normal dogs (Pensinger, 1964) but neurohormone
changes were not measured. While any potential detrimental effects of early institution of severe
dietary sodium restriction have not been shown, it is clear that all drug therapies shown to improve survival in CHF act by blunting neurohumoral activation. Therefore, severe sodium restriction
(i.e., near the AAFCO minimum of 20 mg/100 kcal) is not currently recommended for dogs with
ISACHC Stage 1 or 2 cardiac disease. Conversely, high dietary sodium intake in early disease is
likely detrimental. Table 5 summarizes the authors’ current recommendations, based on available
literature and clinical experience.

327

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

Most owners are unaware of the sodium content of pet foods and human foods and need very specific instructions regarding appropriate dog foods, acceptable low salt treats, and methods for administering medications (Table 6). Owners also should be counselled on specific foods to avoid such
as baby food, pickled foods, bread, pizza, condiments (e.g., ketchup, soy sauce), lunch meats and
cold cuts (e.g., ham, corned beef, salami, sausages, bacon, hot dogs), most cheeses, processed foods
(e.g., potato mixes, rice mixes, macaroni and cheese), canned vegetables (unless “no salt added”),
and snack foods (e.g., potato chips, packaged popcorn, crackers).
Mildly reduced dietary sodium can be achieved with a therapeutic diet designed for animals with
early cardiac disease or with certain diets designed for use in older dogs. If using a diet designed
for senior dogs, be sure to look at the characteristics of the individual product. There is no legal
definition for a senior diet so the levels of calories, protein, sodium, and other nutrients can vary
dramatically between different companies’ products. Diets designed for animals with renal disease
are not recommended for most cardiac patients because of the protein restriction (unless severe
renal dysfunction is present).

TABLE 6 - LOW SODIUM METHODS FOR ADMINISTERING MEDICATIONS
• Switch from pills to a compounded, flavored liquid medication. Be cautious in this approach because the
pharmacokinetics of certain drugs may be altered when compounded
• Teach the owner to pill the animal without using foods. This may be done without any devices
or by using devices designed for this purpose
• Use low sodium foods to insert the pills before administration
- Fresh fruit (e.g., banana, orange, melon)
- Low sodium canned pet food
- Peanut butter (labeled as “no salt added”)
- Home-cooked meat (without salt) - not lunch meats

Heart

As CHF becomes more severe, more sodium restriction may allow lower dosages of diuretics to be
used to control clinical signs. To achieve severe sodium restriction, it is usually necessary to feed
a commercial therapeutic diet designed for cardiac patients. Typically, these diets are severely restricted in both sodium and chloride; levels of other nutrients vary with the individual product.
Dietary chloride levels are often ignored but research suggests that chloride may be important in
the optimal management of CHF. Research in people has shown that sodium and chloride administration are necessary for the full expression of hypertension in people (Boegehold & Kotchen,
1989). Chloride administration also appears to decrease plasma renin activity in salt depleted rats
(Kotchen et al, 1980; Muller, 1986).
The patient with heart failure has chronic activation of the RAA system, which could be significantly influenced by dietary chloride. In addition, furosemide is known to block chloride transport in the ascending loop of Henle, and hypochloremia (and hyponatremia) can develop in
advanced CHF. Therefore, chloride is likely to play an important role in the CHF patient. Unfortunately, little is known about optimal dietary intake for CHF patients and additional research
will be required to make specific recommendations.

In the past, when digoxin and diuretics were the mainstays of therapy for people and dogs with

use in the management of dogs with CHF and this medication results in renal potassium sparing.
Therefore, ACE inhibitors are known to cause increased serum potassium, with some animals
developing hyperkalemia (Roudebush et al, 1994; COVE Study Group, 1995; Rush et al, 1998).
This can especially be a problem in animals eating commercial cardiac diets since some commercial cardiac diets contain increased potassium concentrations to counteract the theoretical loss
due to diuretics.
In addition to the importance of the diets' compatibility with current ACE inhibitor use, other
newer cardiac medications may also be used more commonly. Spironolactone, an aldosterone
antagonist and a potassium-sparing diuretic is being used with greater frequency in veterinary
patient after reports of improved survival in human CHF patients (Pitt et al, 1999). This medication is even more likely than other diuretics to cause hyperkalemia. Finally, many people know
about the association between diuretics and hypokalemia either from their own medical condition or that of a friend or relative, and some mistakenly give their dogs with CHF bananas or
potassium supplements in an effort to prevent this problem. Routine monitoring of serum potassium is recommended for all patients with CHF, particularly those receiving an ACE inhibitor or
spironolactone. If hyperkalemia is present, a diet with a lower potassium content should be selected.

Preventing nutritional deficiencies
versus nutritional pharmacology
Historically, a variety of nutritional deficiencies have been known to cause cardiac disease in various
species. These include thiamine, magnesium, vitamin E, selenium, and taurine. Although nutritional
deficiencies are generally uncommon (except in owners feeding unbalanced homemade diets), they
may still play a role in some cardiac diseases of dogs. Nutritional deficiencies may also develop secondary to the disease or its treatment. There is also blurring of the lines between the benefits of correcting a nutritional deficiency (e.g. as in a cat with taurine deficiency-induced dilated cardiomyopathy)
and the pharmacological effects of a nutrient (e.g. the positive inotropic effects of taurine). In addition, new information is coming out on species and even breed differences in nutrient requirements.
Thus, there appears to be much more to providing optimal levels of nutrients than just preventing a
deficiency.

> Protein and amino acids

• Protein
In addition to sodium restriction, the dietary recommendations in the 1960's for dogs with CHF
were to restrict protein intake to “reduce the metabolic load on congested, aging, and diseased
kidneys and liver” (Pensinger, 1964). Restricting protein can actually be detrimental in terms of
lean body mass loss and malnutrition. Dogs with CHF should not be protein restricted, unless they
have concurrent advanced renal disease. Some of the diets designed for dogs with cardiac disease
are low in protein (3.6-4.2 gm/100 kcal). In addition, some veterinarians recommend protein-restricted renal diets for dogs with cardiac disease because these diets often (but not always) are also
moderately sodium restricted.
Unless severe renal dysfunction is present (i.e., serum creatinine>3.0 mg/dL), high-quality protein should be fed to meet canine AAFCO minimums for adult maintenance requirements
(5.1 gm/100 kcal; Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), 2005). In one study,
daily protein intake of dogs with cardiac disease ranged from 2.3-18.8 g/100 kcal so some dogs with
cardiac disease are clearly not eating sufficient dietary protein (Freeman et al, 2003b).
Another misconception that impacts cardiac disease is the still widespread belief that dietary protein should be restricted in early renal disease (see chapter 8). Although the majority of dogs treated with ACE inhibitors do not develop azotemia, some dogs receiving ACE inhibitors can develop azotemia (COVE Study Group, 1995). Azotemia occurs more frequently when ACE inhibi329

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

tors are used in conjunction with diuretics although, in a small number of dogs, azotemia can develop from ACE inhibitors alone. When concurrent ACE inhibitor and diuretic use causes azotemia, reduction of the furosemide dose is indicated to reduce azotemia. A protein-restricted diet is
not necessary in this situation unless medication changes do not correct the problem and the renal
disease progresses.

• Taurine
The association between taurine and feline DCM described in the late 1980’s prompted investigators to examine the role of taurine in canine DCM (Pion et al, 1987). Unlike cats, dogs are
thought to be able to synthesize adequate amounts of taurine endogenously and taurine is not
considered to be required in canine diets. Although initial studies showed that most dogs with
DCM did not have low plasma taurine concentrations, certain breeds of dogs with DCM (eg, Cocker Spaniels and Golden Retrievers) did have low taurine concentrations (Kramer et al, 1995).
The association between dogs with DCM and low taurine concentrations has been best established in the American Cocker Spaniel (Kramer et al, 1995; Kittleson et al, 1997).
In a study by Backus et al, 12 of 19 Newfoundlands tested had taurine concentrations consistent
with taurine deficiency. However, none of these dogs had DCM (Backus et al, 2003). Other commonly reported breeds of dogs with DCM and taurine deficiency include Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Saint Bernard, English Setter (Freeman et al, 2001; Fascetti et al, 2003).
When concurrent ACE inhibitor
and diuretic use causes azotemia,
reduction of the diuretic dose is
indicated to reduce azotemia.
A protein restricted diet is not
necessary in this situation unless
medication changes do not correct
the problem and the renal disease
progresses.

The first question about the relationship between canine DCM and taurine deficiency is whether
DCM is caused by dietary deficiency.
In one retrospective study, 20 of 37 dogs with DCM tested for plasma and whole blood taurine
concentrations were considered to be taurine-deficient (Freeman et al, 2001). There was no significant difference in mean dietary taurine content (based on manufacturers’ information) between
taurine deficient and non taurine deficient dogs, nor was there a correlation between dietary
content and circulating taurine concentrations (Freeman et al, 2001). Of the taurine deficient
dogs, 7 were eating a lamb and rice based diet and seven were eating an increased fiber diet.

Heart

Twelve dogs with DCM and taurine deficiency were reported to be eating dry diets containing
lamb meal, rice, or both as primary ingredients (Fascetti et al, 2003).
In another study, 131 normal dogs were tested for plasma and whole blood taurine concentrations.
In this study, dogs consuming diets containing rice bran or whole grain rice had lower taurine
concentrations (Delaney et al, 2003). Thus, it may be the rice bran component of diets that affects
taurine concentrations although lamb meal also is known to have decreased amino acid digestibility (Johnson et al, 1998).
Alternatively, dietary protein quality and quantity may also play a role in taurine deficiency. In
one study, a group of Beagles fed a low taurine, very low protein diet for 48 months had a decrease in whole blood taurine concentrations and 1 of the 16 dogs developed DCM (Sanderson, 2001).

Finally, some dog breeds may be predisposed to taurine deficiency when fed certain types of diets
because of higher requirements or breed-specific metabolic abnormalities.

In a retrospective study, of the taurine
deficient dogs, 7 were eating a lamb
and rice based diet and 7 were eating
an increased fiber diet.

330

A second question that still remains is whether taurine supplementation reverses DCM in dogs
with concurrent taurine deficiency.
In one small study, 11 Cocker Spaniels supplemented with taurine and carnitine showed improvement in clinical parameters and echocardiographic measurements (Kittleson et al, 1997). Whether the response would be similar with taurine alone remains to be seen. In one small retrospec-

In Cocker Spaniels with DCM,
measuring plasma and whole blood
taurine concentrations is
recommended.

• Arginine
Nitric oxide is an endogenous vascular smooth muscle relaxant. It is synthesized from L-arginine
and molecular oxygen (Figure 9).
Circulating nitric oxide is elevated in people with CHF, regardless of the underlying cause and in
two studies of dogs and cats with heart disease (De Belder et al, 1993; Comini et al, 1999; De Laforcade et al, 2000; Freeman et al, 2003a). However, one study of dogs showed lower nitric oxide
concentrations in dogs with untreated CVD (Pedersen et al, 2003). High circulating nitric oxide
levels may have an initial beneficial compensatory effect but can be detrimental when this response is prolonged. High levels of nitric oxide can have a negative inotropic effect and can decrease the responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation (Gulick et al, 1989; Yamamoto et al, 1997).
There appear to be competing responses occurring in CHF. While iNOS is upregulated in patients
with CHF producing high circulating levels of nitric oxide, eNOS is actually downregulated and
reduces endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Agnoletti et al, 1999, Katz et al, 2000).
331

Heart

While it is unlikely that the breeds at high risk for DCM such as the
Doberman Pinscher or the Boxer have taurine deficiency, certain
breeds (eg, Cocker Spaniel, Newfoundlands, Golden Retrievers) and
atypical breeds (eg, Scottish Terrier, Border Collie) may have concurrent taurine deficiency. Therefore, in these latter breeds, measuring
plasma and whole blood taurine concentrations is recommended. In
addition, taurine concentrations should be measured in dogs with
DCM that are eating lamb meal and rice, very low protein, or increased fiber diets. Although the extent of the benefit of supplementation
is not yet clear, taurine supplementation is recommended until plasma and whole blood taurine
concentrations from the patient are available. Even in dogs with taurine deficiency that do
respond to taurine supplementation, the response is generally not as dramatic as in taurine deficient cats with DCM. The optimal dose of taurine for correcting a deficiency has not been determined but the currently recommended dose is 500-1000 mg q 8-12 hours. Taurine can be provided as a supplement although certain diets may contain enough taurine to raise plasma taurine
concentrations.

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

Response to therapy may be breed dependent. In a study of a litter of Portugese Water Dogs with
DCM, taurine was below the reference range in eight of eight puppies tested, and DCM was diagnosed in eight of the nine puppies (Alroy, 2000). Taurine supplementation was instituted in 6 of
the puppies, which significantly increased plasma and whole blood taurine concentrations as well
as cardiac function (Alroy, 2000). In a study of Beagles fed a low taurine, very low protein diet for
48 months, the one dog that developed DCM had improvement in
fractional shortening after three months of taurine supplementation
(Sanderson et al, 2001). Some of the potential benefits of taurine in
dogs with DCM may be due to its positive inotropic effects or role in
calcium regulation in the myocardium. Beneficial effects of taurine
have been shown in animal models with experimentally-induced
heart failure and in unblinded human clinical trials (Elizarova et al,
1993, Azuma, 1994).

Minimum taurine requirements for
dogs have not been established by
AAFCO, but the minimum taurine
requirement for adult cats is
25 mg/100 kcal for dry food and
50 mg/100 kcal for canned foods
(AAFCO, 2005). A diet with a
taurine content of 50 mg/100 kcal
would provide approximately
1000 mg/day of taurine to a 40 kg
dog.

tive study that compared dogs with DCM that were taurine deficient and were treated with taurine (plus medical therapy) to dogs that were not taurine deficient, there was no difference in the
number that were able to discontinue medications, in the furosemide dosage, in echocardiographic measurements, or survival (Freeman et al, 2001). Another retrospective study of 12 dogs with
DCM and taurine deficiency showed a within-group improvement in E-point to septal separation
and fractional shortening after taurine supplementation but there was no comparison group (Fascetti et al, 2003).

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

The reduction in eNOS and resulting loss of normal vasodilation have adverse effects in the
patient with CHF (Feng et al, 1998). People with CHF have a reduction of peripheral blood flow
both at rest and during exercise (Maguire et al, 1998). This abnormality may contribute to exercise intolerance in these patients. Endothelial dysfunction has also been demonstrated in dogs
with experimentally-induced CHF and is associated with decreased gene expression of eNOS
(Wang et al, 1997).
Based on the findings of endothelial dysfunction in patients with CHF, investigators have begun
to study the effects of arginine supplementation in this group. In normal patients, L-arginine supplementation is unlikely to have an effect on nitric oxide production because L-arginine is found
in concentrations much higher than the Km values for NOS (Tsikas et al, 2000). But the situation in patients with CHF may be very different and, in fact, L-arginine supplementation has been
shown to improve endothelial dysfunction (Kubota et al a, 1997; Feng et al, 1999; Kanaya et al,
1999; Hambrecht et al, 2000). L-arginine supplementation has been tested in people with CHF in
a number of studies (Kubota et al, 1997; Kanaya et al, 1999; Banning & Prendergast, 1999; Bocchi
et al, 2000; Hambrecht et al, 2000). These studies have shown increased circulating concentrations of nitric oxide but improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation and cardiac output. These
studies also have shown reduced heart rate and systemic vascular resistance, with no negative
effects on cardiac contractility or other echocardiographic variables (Kubota et al, 1997; Hambrecht et al, 2000; Bocchi et al, 2000). Although one study of arginine supplementation found no
effect on exercise tolerance, another study showed that L-arginine reduced dyspnea in response
to increasing CO2 production during exercise in people with severe chronic heart failure (Kanaya
et al, 1999; Banning & Prendergast, 1999). Thus, while much research is needed in this area, arginine supplementation may provide beneficial effects in patients with CHF.

The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme, nitric oxide

• endothelial NOS (eNOS): eNOS is required for maintenance
of normal vascular tone and as a physiologic messenger
• neuronal NOS (nNOS): eNOS and nNOS are constitutive
forms and are always produced in low levels
• inducible NOS (iNOS): iNOS is inducible by a variety of
inflammatory mediators including the cytokines, tumor necrosis
factor (TNF), and interleukin-1 (IL-1), and free radicals.

332

Fat is a source of calories and essential fatty acids and increases
the palatability of the diet. However, depending upon the type of
fat, it can have significant effects on immune function, the production of inflammatory mediators and even hemodynamics.

• n-3 fatty acids
Most human and canine diets contain primarily n-6 fatty acids.
In n-6 fatty acids (eg linoleic acid, γ-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid), the first double-bond is at the position of the 6th carbon from the methyl end. However, n-3 fatty acids [α-linolenic
acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA)] have the first double-bond at the 3rd carbon from the
methyl end. Although this seems like a minor change, it confers
very different structure and characteristics to the fatty acid. Plasma membranes normally contain very low concentrations of n-3
fatty acids, but levels can be increased by a food or supplement
enriched in n-3 fatty acids.
Dogs with heart failure have lower plasma concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA; 22:6n-6), regardless of the underlying disease (Figure 10)
(Freeman et al, 1998; Rush et al, 2000). This alteration in plasma
fatty acids has also been found in people with various diseases as
well, suggesting that metabolic changes may occur in certain
diseases that increase the use of n-3 fatty acids. Therefore, supplementation may improve an absolute or relative n-3 fatty acid
“deficiency”.

There is controversy as to whether dose of n-3 fatty acids or the
ratio of n-6: n-3 fatty acids is more important for the beneficial
effects of n-3 fatty acids. Some evidence points to the primary
importance of the total n-3 dose but it may also be important
to avoid a high n-6:n-3 ratio as well. Although an optimal dose
has not been determined, the authors currently recommend a
dosage of 40 mg/kg EPA and 25 mg/kg DHA for dogs with anorexia or cachexia. Unless the diet
is one of a few specially designed therapeutic diets, supplementation will be necessary since other
commercial diets will not achieve this n-3 fatty acid dose.

The exact content of EPA and DHA in individual fish oil supplements varies widely. The most
common formulation of fish oil, however, is one gram capsules that contain 180 mg EPA and
120 mg DHA. At this concentration, fish oil can be administered at a dose of 1 capsule per 10
pounds of body weight to achieve the authors’ recommended EPA and DHA dose. Fish oil with
higher concentrations of EPA and DHA can be obtained from medical supply catalogs and may
be more feasible for large dogs.

Heart

• n-3 fatty acid supplementation

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

Fish oil supplementation reduced cachexia and, in some, but
not all dogs with CHF-induced anorexia, improved food intake
(Freeman et al, 1998). Finally, n-3 fatty acids have been shown
in a number of rodent, primate, and canine models to reduce
arrhythmogenesis (Charnock, 1994; Kang & Leaf, 1996; Billman et al, 1999). Many dogs with CVD and most dogs with
DCM have arrhythmias. In some dogs with cardiac disease, sudden death due to arrhythmias is the first manifestation of the
disease in otherwise asymptomatic dogs. Therefore, n-3 fatty
acid supplementation may be beneficial even before CHF develops.

FIGURE 10 - PLASMA FATTY ACID CONCENTRATIONS

Concentration (%)

n-3 fatty acid supplementation also reduces the more inflammatory eicosanoids. n-3 fatty acids are known to reduce the production of the more inflammatory 2- and 4-series eicosanoids
(eg, there is a shift from production of prostaglandin E2 to prostaglandin E3). In a study of dogs with DCM, dogs supplemented with fish oil had a greater reduction in prostaglandin E2
production compared to dogs receiving the placebo (Freeman
et al, 1998). This may have benefits in terms of reduced inflammation. n-3 fatty acids also are known to decrease the production of the inflammatory cytokines, TNF and IL-1, which are
elevated in CHF (Endres et al, 1989; Meydani et al, 1991; Freeman et al, 1998).

Although an optimal dose has not
been determined, the authors currently
recommend a dosage of 40 mg/kg EPA
and 25 mg/kg DHA for dogs with
anorexia or cachexia. Unless the diet
is one of a few specially designed
therapeutic diets, supplementation
will be necessary since other
commercial diets will not achieve
this n-3 fatty acid dose.

Fish oil supplements should always contain vitamin E as an antioxidant, but other nutrients should
not be included to avoid toxicities. Similarly, cod liver oil should not be used because of the possibility for vitamins A and D toxicity. Finally, although flax seed oil contains high levels of α-linolenic acid, this fatty acid must be converted to EPA and DHA for its beneficial effects. Species
vary in the ability to make this conversion: dogs have the enzymes to convert it but with limited
efficiency. Therefore, flax seed oil is not recommended as an n-3 fatty acid supplement.

> Minerals and vitamins

• Potassium
Potassium is an important electrolyte in cardiac patients for a number of reasons. Hypokalemia
potentiates arrhythmias, causes muscle weakness, and predisposes patients to digitalis toxicity. In
addition, Class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as procainamide and quinidine, are relatively ineffective in the face of hypokalemia. Hypokalemia was considered to be a common problem in the past
when diuretics were the mainstays of therapy. Many of the medications used in dogs with CHF
can predispose a patient to hypokalemia, including loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) and thiazide
diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide). However, with the increased use of ACE inhibitors, hypokalemia is no longer very common in dogs with CHF.
In addition to medication effects, inadequate dietary intake could predispose a dog to hypokalemia. In one study, 49% of dogs with cardiac disease ate less potassium than the AAFCO minimum value (170 mg/100 kcal). Intakes ranged from 37-443 mg/100 kcal (Freeman et al, 2003b).
This suggests that, based on dietary intake alone, some dogs may be predisposed to hypokalemia
(in addition to the risk for hyperkalemia previously discussed) and underscores the importance of
monitoring serum potassium in dogs with CHF.

• Magnesium

Heart

Magnesium is an essential prosthetic group in hundreds of enzymatic reactions involving carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism, protein and nucleic acid synthesis, the adenylate cyclase system, and cardiac and smooth muscle contractility. Thus, magnesium plays an important role in
normal cardiovascular function. It is also clear that alterations in magnesium homeostasis in
people and dogs are common, and can have deleterious effects in a variety of cardiovascular conditions including hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and cardiac
arrhythmias (Resnick, 1984; Rayssiguer, 1984; Gottleib et al, 1990; Iseri, 1986; Cobb & Michell,
1992). In addition, numerous drugs used to treat cardiac conditions, including digoxin and loop
diuretics are associated with magnesium depletion (Quamme & Dirks, 1994). Therefore, dogs with
heart failure receiving these medications have the potential to develop hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia can increase the risk of arrhythmias, decrease cardiac contractility, and can potentiate the adverse effects of cardiac medications.
There have been conflicting reports on the prevalence of hypomagnesemia in dogs with cardiac
disease. Reports range from “uncommon” (O'Keefe et al, 1993) to 2/84 (Edwards et al, 1991); fifty
percent (Rush, 2000) to two-thirds of Lasix-treated dogs (Cobb & Michell, 1992).

Hypokalemia was considered to be
a common problem in the past when
diuretics were the mainstays of
therapy. Many of the medications
used in dogs with CHF can
predispose a patient to hypokalemia,
including loop diuretics (eg,
furosemide) and thiazide diuretics
(eg, hydrochlorothiazide). However,
with the increased use of ACE
inhibitors, hypokalemia is no longer
very common in dogs with CHF.

One of the difficulties in diagnosing magnesium deficiency is that only one percent of the total
body magnesium is in the extracellular space. Therefore, normal serum magnesium does not necessarily mean there are adequate total body stores. Serial measurements of serum magnesium are currently recommended, especially in dogs with arrhythmias or those receiving large doses of diuretics. If low serum magnesium concentrations do arise and the dog is eating a diet that is low in
magnesium, a diet higher in magnesium may be beneficial. Magnesium concentrations vary widely in commercial pet foods. Commercial reduced sodium diets for dogs can contain between 940 mg magnesium/100 kcal (compared to an AAFCO minimum of 10 mg/100 kcal). If the dog
remains hypomagnesemic, oral magnesium supplementation will be required (e.g. magnesium
oxide).

• B vitamins
(Table 7)
Little research has been conducted on the prevalence of B vitamin deficiencies in dogs with cardiac disease. However, there have long been concerns over the risk of B vitamin deficiencies in
CHF due to anorexia and urinary loss of water soluble vitamins secondary to diuretic use. This
334

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

may be less of a problem now that there are more effective medications for treatment of CHF but
even in one study from 1991, 91% of people with CHF had low thiamine concentrations (Seligmann et al, 1991). In this study, patients were being treated with furosemide, ACE inhibitors,
nitrates, and digoxin (where appropriate).
Low doses of furosemide were shown to cause increased urinary loss of thiamine in healthy people
and in rats (Rieck et al, 1999; Lubetsky et al, 1999). Although B vitamin status has not been reported for dogs with CHF, they may have higher dietary B vitamin requirements. Most commercial
cardiac diets contain increased levels of water soluble vitamins to offset urinary losses so supplementation usually is not required.
> Other nutrients

• Antioxidants
Much attention has been given to antioxidants for their potential role in the prevention and treatment of human cardiac diseases. Reactive oxygen species are a by-product of oxygen metabolism
for which the body normally compensates through the production of endogenous antioxidants.
An imbalance between oxidant production and antioxidant protection (eg, oxidative stress),
however, could increase the risk for cardiac disease (Figure 11). Antioxidants are produced endogenously but also can be supplied exogenously. The major antioxidants include enzymatic antioxidants (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) and oxidant quenchers (e.g.,
vitamin C, vitamin E, glutathione, and β-carotene).
Oxidative stress has been implicated in the development of a number of cardiac diseases. Increased oxidative stress has been demonstrated in people with CHF (Belch et al, 1991; Keith et al,
1998). In dogs with heart failure, regardless of the underlying cause, there are increased levels of
biomarkers of oxidative stress and a reduction in certain antioxidants, particularly vitamin E (Freeman et al, 1999; Freeman et al, 2005). These alterations suggest an imbalance between oxidant
stress and antioxidant protection in dogs with CHF.

Heart

Additional research is required to evaluate the effect, but antioxidant supplementation may hold
promise in the future for the therapy of animals with cardiac disease.

• L-Carnitine
L-Carnitine is a quaternary amine (Figure 12) whose major role is in long-chain fatty acid metabolism and energy production. Carnitine deficiency syndromes in people have been associated
with primary myocardial disease and, based on this and its high concentrations in cardiac muscle,
its role in canine DCM also has been of interest.

335

4 - Pathophysiology and specific issues of nutritional management

L-carnitine deficiency was reported in a family of Boxers in 1991 (Keene et al, 1991). Since that
time, L-carnitine supplementation has been used in some dogs with DCM but no blinded prospective studies have been done so a causative role has not been established. In human DCM patients,
most studies of L-carnitine have not been well-controlled. However, one randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study showed improved three-year survival in human DCM patients receiving
2 gm/day L-carnitine (Rizos, 2000).
One of the difficult aspects of studying L-carnitine in DCM is that one must measure myocardial
concentrations since plasma concentrations are often normal even in the face of myocardial deficiency. Therefore, the advancement of knowledge of the role of this nutrient in DCM has been
slow. It is not yet clear whether the carnitine
deficiency seen in some dogs with DCM is
the cause of the disease or merely secondary
FIGURE 11 - ORIGIN OF OXIDATIVE STRESS
to the development of CHF. One study of
dogs with heart failure induced by rapid
pacing showed that myocardial concentrations decreased in normal dogs after the onset
of CHF (Pierpont et al, 1993). However, even
if L-carnitine deficiency is not the inciting
cause of DCM, supplementation may still
provide benefits by improving myocardial
energy production.

Reactive oxygen species

Heart

Oxidative stress comes from the imbalance between
the production of free radicals and antioxidant
defenses.

L-carnitine supplementation has few side
effects but it is expensive and this may be a
significant deterrent for some owners. The
authors offer the option of L-carnitine supplementation to owners of dogs with DCM,
especially Boxers and Cocker spaniels, but do
not consider it essential. The minimum or
optimal dose of L-carnitine necessary to
replete a dog with low myocardial carnitine
concentrations is not known, but the currently recommended dose is 50-100 mg/kg
PO q 8 hours.

• Coenzyme Q10
Coenzyme Q10 is a cofactor required for energy production and has antioxidant properties. There
are a number of mechanisms by which coenzyme Q10 might play a role in cardiac disease. Some
investigators have proposed coenzyme Q10 deficiency as a possible cause for DCM but this has
not been proven. Even in dogs with experimentally-induced CHF, serum coenzyme Q10 levels
were not reduced (Harker-Murray et al, 2000).

The minimum or optimal dose
of L-carnitine necessary to replete
a dog with low myocardial carnitine
concentrations is not known,
but the currently recommended
dose is 50-100 mg/kg PO q 8 hours.

The most enthusiasm for coenzyme Q10 has been as a dietary supplement in the treatment of
people or dogs with DCM. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation has anecdotally been reported to be
beneficial but most of the human studies of coenzyme Q10 supplementation have not been wellcontrolled and results are conflicting. However, some encouraging results have been found (Langsjoen et al, 1994; Sacher et al, 1997; Munkholm et al, 1999). In one study of dogs with experimentally-induced CHF, coenzyme Q10 supplementation increased serum, but not myocardial, concentrations (Harker-Murray et al, 2000). The bioavailability of coenzyme Q10 varies in different tissues and also depends upon the degree of tissue deficiency in that tissue.
The current recommended dose in canine patients is 30 mg PO BID, although up to 90 mg PO
BID has been recommended for large dogs. The purported benefits of supplementation include

Dietary modification in dogs needs to be individualized - not all dogs with cardiac disease will
need the same dietary formulation. Patients with cardiac disease vary in terms of their clinical
signs, laboratory parameters, and food preferences and these should all affect diet selection. For
example, more severe sodium restriction would be required for a dog with DCM and CHF than
for a dog with asymptomatic DCM. Dogs with cardiac cachexia require a calorically-dense diet
while an overweight dog should be fed a calorically-restricted diet. Dogs with cardiac disease may
be hyper-, hypo-, or normokalemic and this will influence the choice of diet.

Heart

Concurrent diseases also influence diet choice and, in one study, concurrent diseases were present
in 61% of dogs with cardiac disease (Freeman et al, 2003b). For example, a dog with CVD and
colitis would need a diet that is sodium restricted but also one that has nutritional modifications
to help manage the colitis (eg, reduced fat, increased fiber).
Based on these patient parameters, a diet or diets can be selected for the individual patient. There
currently are a number of commercial veterinary diets available that are specifically designed for
animals with cardiac disease. Specific characteristics of these foods vary, but they are moderately
to severely sodium restricted and generally contain increased levels of B vitamins. Some cardiac
diets also may include increased levels of taurine, carnitine, antioxidants, or n-3 fatty acids. In
some cases, a “cardiac” diet may not be needed as some over-the-counter diets may have the properties desired for an individual dog. The authors also recommend offering more than one diet
that would be appropriate for a dog so that the owner can see which is most palatable to the pet.
Having a number of dietary choices is particularly beneficial for more severely affected CHF
patients, in which a cyclical or selective loss of appetite is common.
In addition to the dog food(s) selected, one must also give the owner careful instructions on treats
and table food. In some cases, dogs may be eating an ideal dog food but are getting large amounts
of sodium from treats. In one study, over 90% of dogs with cardiac disease received treats and these
dogs were receiving up to 100% of their sodium (median, 25%) from treats (Freeman et al, 2003b).
Therefore, in addition to finding a diet that has the desired nutritional properties and palatability, it also is important to devise an overall dietary plan that meets the owner's expectations. This

includes devising a satisfactory method for administering medications. Most people administering
medications to their dogs use foods as a way to administer the medication (Freeman et al, 2003b).
Discussing appropriate options for an owner to use for this purpose is necessary, as the foods most
commonly used by owners are very high in sodium (eg, cheese, lunch meats, etc). Including all
forms of dietary intake in the overall diet plan is important to achieve success with nutritional
modification.
In many cases, the desired nutrient modifications can be achieved through diet alone. However,
supplementation of certain nutrients may be desirable if they are either not in a particular diet or
not at high enough levels to achieve the desired effect. One issue with the administration of dietary supplements is that they should not take the place of standard cardiac medications (eg, ACE
inhibitors, diuretics). Dogs with severe CHF may be receiving 10-20 pills per day and it may be
difficult for the owner to give supplements on top of this without discontinuing one or more of
the cardiac medications. It is important to ask each owner about any dietary supplements being
used as this is often not information that is volunteered (ie, dietary supplements are often not
considered medications or diet). This will help to determine if any
harmful supplements are being given and if the supplements are
being given at an appropriate dose. In situations in which pill administration is becoming overwhelming for an owner, the veterinarian
There currently are a number of commercial veterinary diets available
can assist the owner in determining which dietary supplements have
that are specifically designed for animals with cardiac disease. Specific
characteristics of these foods vary, but they are moderately to severely
the least potential benefits and can be discontinued.

Heart

sodium restricted and generally contain increased levels of B vitamins.
Some cardiac diets also may include increased levels of taurine,
carnitine, antioxidants, or n-3 fatty acids.

338

Finally, owners should be aware that dietary supplements are not
regulated in the same way as drugs. They do not require proof of safety, efficacy, or quality control before they can be sold. Therefore,
careful selection of type, dose, and brand is important to avoid toxicities or complete lack of efficacy.

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

The majority of cardiac dogs suffer from systolic failure due either to acquired chronic valvular disease
(endocardiosis) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The former disease very often affects small-breed dogs.
DCM is most common in large-breed dogs.

Key Points
to remember:

The role of nutrition
in cardiac disease

Heart

• One of the main goals of dietetic
strategy is to achieve optimal body
weight whatever the initial situation: obesity (especially in case of a
subclinical disease) or cachexia in
some severe cardiac diseases.
Anorexia is a common phenomenon
in cardiac patients that needs to be
given due consideration: it is one of
the main reasons for the request to
euthanize patients with severe cardiac disease. It may be directly linked
to respiratory problems, to fatigue
accompanying heart failure, to nausea induced by medication or to poor
palatability of certain cardiac diets,
containing low sodium and protein
content.
Selecting a palatable food, giving
frequent small meals and encouraging the dog to eat are all measures
that should not be neglected in
therapeutic management.
• Cardiac dogs often suffer from a
deficiency of EPA-DHA, long-chain n3 fatty acids. A food with a higher
EPA-DHA content facilitates the
treatment of cardiac cachexia.

• Severe sodium restriction has been
inappropriately recommended for
far too long. Its application is
unwarranted in the initial stages of
heart failure, as it risks hastening the
progression of the cardiac disease by
activating the renin-angiotensin system, especially when angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
are simultaneously prescribed.
A moderate restriction of sodium
content (< 80-100 mg/100 kcal) is sufficient for stages I and II of heart failure. Only severe heart failure justifies restricting sodium content to
50 mg/100 kcal.
• A cardiac dog must receive a normal intake of high quality proteins
to combat cardiac cachexia. Limiting
the protein intake is not indicated,
except for concomitant hepatic encephalopathy or kidney disease that
demands such a restriction. Taurine
supplementation is recommended as
this sulfated amino acid has positive
properties that can prove effective in
the prevention and treatment of
dilated cardiomyopathy.

• Arginine is a precursor of nitric
oxide (NO), which has been identified as a relaxation factor for the
smooth muscle of blood vessels.
Supplementary arginine intake will
indirectly help combat hypertension.
• L-carnitine is concentrated in the
striated muscles and the heart
where it plays a key role in providing
energy to the cells. L-carnitine deficiency has been suggested in connection with dilated cardiomyopathy.
Clinical improvements have been
reported after the administration of
a supplement, although several
months of treatment are necessary
to achieve changes that can be
detectable by echocardiography.
• Free radicals, which are responsible
for oxidation of membranous phospholipids, aggravate cardiac lesions.
Oxidative stress is a causal factor of
dilated cardiomyopathy. The daily
administration of antioxidants in
the food is one of the main ways of
combating the progression of heart
failure.

THE IMPORTANCE OF TAURINE INTAKE
TO ENCOURAGE OPTIMAL CARDIAC
CONTRACTILITY
Taurine accounts for at least 40% of
the pool of free amino acids in the
heart. This amino acid is normally
synthesized in the dog from methionine and cystine.
The taurine
concentration can be limited in certain conditions such as when the animal receives a food with reduced
protein content or when taurine synthesis is insufficient, as is the case in
some breeds and some lines. The synthesis of taurine appears to be much
less efficient in large-breed dogs (>
35 kg) compared to Beagles (Ko et al,
2005).
A simple blood sample will help
determine whether the dog has
taurine deficiency. Taurine analysis
should be performed on whole
blood as taurine is stored predominantly in blood cells. The plasma
taurine concentration does not properly reflect the muscular and cardiac storage of taurine.

2. It has an antiarrhythmic role (Satoh
& Sperelakis, 1998).
3. It helps preserve the integrity of
cardiac muscle cells: in vitro taurine
prevents myocyte hypertrophy induced by angiotensin II (Takahahsi et al,
1998).
It has long been known that taurine
deficiency can provoke degeneration
of the retina and slow down growth.
Only recently has DCM in dogs been
associated with extremely low plasma taurine levels.

The correlation has especially been
shown in Newfoundland dogs in the
United Kingdom (Dukes-McEwan et al,
2001). Positive responses to taurine
supplementation have been noted in
Boxers suffering from DCM. It is therefore advisable to provide sufficient
quantities of taurine in the food to
prevent any risk of deficiency.

Summary of select publications…
There is a hypothesis associating dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dogs,
especially large breeds, with taurine
deficiency. This study was designed

to evaluate the taurine status of a
group of Newfoundland dogs in the
United Kingdom. One hundred and
four Newfoundlands underwent cli-

nical and echocardiography examinations. The evaluation of taurine
status was based on total blood analysis (nmol/mL). In addition, a detailed dietary history was obtained for
each dog. The echocardiography
examinations permited the classification of dogs as normal, dogs with
dilated cardiomyopathy, dogs with a
reduction in shortening fraction or
dogs presenting with dilatation of
the left ventricle.

A low taurine concentration has
been shown in a significant number
of Newfoundland dogs. In this study
population, the taurine values tended to be lower than in dogs with
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The
purpose of this study was to test the
impact of taurine or methionine supplementation in correcting taurine
deficiency.

The blood and urine taurine concentration, as well as the urine creatinine concentration were measured
after three and six months of supplementation and compared with the
initial values.
The blood taurine concentration
increased in all the dogs. It rose from
144±8 nmol/mL at the start of the

study to 324±14 nmol/mL after three
months of supplementation and
275±10 nmol/mL after six months of
supplementation. No differences
could be distinguished with respect
to the type or dose of supplementation.
The urine taurine/creatinine ratio
was minimal at the start of the study,
increasing significantly with supplementation of methionine or taurine,
more makedly with the highest taurine
concentration.

These results suggest that 250 mg of
taurine or 750 mg of methionine per
os twice a day, and a diet providing
1000 mg of taurine/kg normalizes
the taurine concentration in taurine
deficient Newfoundland dogs. For
the dogs in this study, a low taurine
status cannot be explained by greater taurine losses or an inability to
utilize methionine as a taurine precursor.

Heart

The dogs with clinical DCM received
1000 mg of taurine by mouth twice a
day. The remaining dogs were matched by age and sex and then received 250 mg of taurine or 750 mg of
methionine per os twice a day. Four
dogs were fed with a specific food
for very-large dogs.

Forty-eight dogs with a blood taurine
value less than 200 nmol/mL were
identified. Echocardiography examination enabled the establishment of
three categories of dogs: normal,
echocardiography anomalies without
clinical signs (e.g. reduced contractility or dilatation of the left ventricle)
and dogs with clinical DCM.

Skeleton

evelopmental orthopedic diseases and osteoarthritis are
common diseases seen in canine practice and account
for 25% of patient visits to veterinarians. Of those visits for
osteoarticular disorders, 70% are due to diseases of the
appendicular skeleton, 20% are probably due to dietary origin
and more than 22% occur in dogs under one year of age (Richardson
et al, 1997; Johnson et al, 1994). Large breed dogs account for the majority
of cases however any size dog can be affected.
The development of these skeletal diseases may be due in part
to dietary management. Nutritional excesses and deficiencies
can contribute to canine osteoarticular disorders. In many cases,
optimal intake of a balanced diet can prevent or at least diminish
the severity of the diseases. For a few diseases, dietary correction
alone is sufficient to restore skeletal integrity.

Bone composition
Bone is a specialized form of connective tissue with a complex chemical and physical composition (Table 1). Apart from its cellular fraction (10%) and the water phase (25%), it is composed
of an organic matrix and a mineral phase. The cellular fraction includes osteoblasts (organic
matrix-forming cells) and osteoclasts (calcified matrix-resorbing cells). The organic matrix is composed of 90% collagen fibers with a high content of hydroxyproline and 10% aminopolysaccharides, non-collagen proteins and a small quantity of lipid. The mineral phase encompasses about
65% of the bone volume, mainly in the form of hydroxyappatite crystals and amorphous calcium
phosphate, as well as small quantities of other elements. Of the total body calcium and phosphorus, 99% and 80%, respectively, are present in the skeleton.

WITHIN ARTICULAR CARTILAGE

There are striking differences between the organic
and inorganic composition of the main constituents of the skeleton, i.e. bone and cartilage
(Table 1). The difference between bone and cartilage is mainly the flexibility (and therefore the
water content), the lack of mineral deposition,
and the difference in collagen elements. Cartilage
contains chondroblasts, proteoglycans, and collagen. The latter are anchored in the subchondral
bone in the tide-mark.

Hyaluronic acid
Link protein
Core protein
Proteoglycan subunit
Chondroitin sulphate
Keratan sulphate

Proteoglycans are composed of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and a core protein called aggrecan.
Aggrecan is an important proteoglycan in cartilage
with keratin sulphate and chondroitin sulphate
being the most important GAGs. About 200
aggrecan molecules are bound via a glycoprotein
to a hyaluran molecule which binds a large quantity of extracellular water (Figure 1).

Large proteoglycan molecules are linked to long
chains of hyaluronic acid and stabilized by two or
more link proteins to form the large proteoglycan
aggregates found in cartilage.

2 - Consequences of nutritional excesses and deficiencies in developmental orthopedic diseases

Collagen molecules in cartilage contain large amounts of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. The
molecules form a triple helix structure, bound to fibrils and these form fibers. Cartilage does not
contain blood or lymphatic vessels. With loading, extracellular water is pressed out of the cartilage until the decreased diameter of the pores and the increased negative charge prevents further
escape of water, whereas at unloading fresh water and nutrients enter the cartilage.

Although most osteoarticular diseases are
multi-factorial, the pathophysiology of each
disease appears to be influenced by nutrition
(Table 2). Excesses of energy and/or calcium
contribute to hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia and
osteochondrosis.

Malnutrition during
growth
Slight underfeeding, with respect to energy
intake, may slow the growth of puppies but
will not influence the adult size of the dog.
After a period of inhibited growth due to malnutrition or illness of short duration, the animal will grow at a greater rate than average for
its age.

In young animals, unlike adults, excessive energy intake does not cause a substantial increase in fat deposition, but rather, a more rapid rate of growth. As
long as there is an adequate protein and essential fatty acid supply, it does
not appear to matter for growing dogs if the proportion of energy comes from
carbohydrate, fat or protein. If the diet supplies sufficient amounts of specific nutrients, the amount of energy will regulate the rate of growth within the
genetic possibilities (Grøndalen & Hedhammar, 1982).

Overnutrition during growth

Rottweiler puppies with an abnormal stance due to carpal
laxity. During the period of fast growth, mostly between 1 3 months of age, dogs may reveal abnormal angulation of the
carpal joint, probably due to a discrepancy between the
increase in body weight and the carpal support. Bandaging
for 10 days will allow the carpus to gain strength and restore
the normal posture of the dog.

> Pathophysiological consequences
of excessive energy intake

Puppies should not be fed to achieve maximum weight gain as this will reduce
the period of growth. Overnutrition in growing puppies causes a more rapid
growth in bone length and a more rapid gain in body weight, when compared with normal or restricted feeding (Riser & Shirer, 1964; Hedhammar et al,
1974; Kasstrom, 1975; Tvedten et al, 1977; Lavelle, 1989; Meyer & Zentek,
1991; Kealy et al, 1992). Heavy body weight will overload the juvenile skeleton and its support system. This may contribute to the development of a
variety of multi-factorial diseases in ad libitum fed dogs including osteochondrosis (Hedhammar et
al, 1974; Lavelle, 1989), hip dysplasia (Hedhammar et al, 1974; Kasstrom, 1975) and fragmentation and fissures of the coronoid process (Grondalen & Hedhammar, 1982) (Figure 2).

High growth rates have been observed in young dogs that are:

- receiving ad libitum palatable commercial food versus meal-restricted energy intake
- fed unrestricted energy enriched diets versus time-restricted food intake.
Not all these studies specifically researched hip joint development or status, but in those where
this was the case, a detrimental effect from overnutrition was observed (Riser & Shirer, 1964; Hedhammar et al, 1974; Kasstrom, 1975; Lavelle, 1989; Kealy et al, 1992).

FIGURE 2 - EVOLUTION OF OSTEOARTICULAR COMPLAINTS RELATED TO THE OVER-CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY

The original study (Hedhammer et al, 1974) was performed on 12 pairs of Great Danes raised on
food rich in protein, calcium, phosphorus and energy. Skeletal diseases including osteochondrosis and delayed skeletal modeling were observed more frequently in the dogs fed ad libitum, whereas the dogs that received restricted feeding (i.e. 2/3 of the amount of the ad lib group) showed
less severe signs.
Skeleton

In a controlled study of Great Danes with high food intake of more balanced commercial foods,
the ad libitum fed dogs revealed more frequent osteochondrosis of the shoulder compared to the
dogs fed 60% of the ad libitum amount (Lavelle, 1989).
Another study showed overload of the skeleton in puppies by either overnutrition through feeding a basal food enriched with rice ad libitum or by stimulating high body weight through the
use of sand belts in the scapular region (Meyer & Zentek, 1991). After 6 months, both the ad libitum fed dogs and the load bearing dogs had skeletal problems. This highlights the adverse effects
of excess weight during growth of large breed puppies (Figure 2).
A study, unique in its design and long term follow up has been published by Kealy et al (1992), in
which 48 Labrador Retrievers, originating from seven different litters, were divided into two
groups at the age of eight weeks. Dogs of one group were allowed to eat a dry dog food ad libitum,
whereas sex-matched littermates received 75% of the amount of food consumed by littermates.
The pair mates were both housed in the same indoor cage with an outdoor run to standardize other
environmental influences, except for 15 minutes during feeding. Other reports, in comparable studies, found that restricted-fed dogs approach the body weight and size of ad libitum fed dogs after
6 months of age (Hedhammar et al, 1974; Lavelle, 1989).
351

2 - Consequences of nutritional excesses and deficiencies in developmental orthopedic diseases

The restricted fed Labrador puppies in Kealy’s study had an average body weight of approximately 20kg, being 78.3 ± 5.35% (mean ± SD) of that of the ad libitum fed pair mates, at the age of
30 weeks. The difference in mean body weight of the 2 groups was even more apparent at the age
of 2 years.

GROWTH AND PROTEINS
The assumption that a high protein
content might be harmful for
large-breed puppies is wrong. There
is no scientific evidence supporting
an undesirable effect of proteins for
growth and especially, ossification
(Nap et al, 1991). On the contrary,
a rather high protein content in
the diet helps to reinforce the
palatability and to restrict the fat
content without including a high
level of carbohydrates.
The quality of dietary proteins has to
be excellent. The quantity to include
in the diet depends obviously on
their biological value and on the
digestibility of protein sources.
Generally, the protein-caloric ratio
should be higher in a puppy-diet
compared to an adult dog diet.

At 30 weeks of age, measurement of the Norberg angle on radiographs of all dogs revealed statistically significant differences (p<.0.05) in joint laxity. These differences were still significant at 2
years of age (Kealy et al, 1992). This long term study with 24 pairs of littermates, raised under the
same environmental conditions, demonstrates a considerably higher incidence of HD in the group
of overfed dogs when compared with the group fed 25% less.
> Influence of the protein content of the diet

Since a high protein diet (30% DMB) did not increase the frequency or severity of skeletal abnormalities in giant breed dogs (as compared with control dogs fed isoenergetic diets) (Nap et al,
1993b), it may be concluded that it is excess body weight during rapid growth, rather than the
high protein content of diet, that can be deleterious for skeletal development. In this study, performed in Great Danes, no differences in occurrence or severity of osteochondrosis occurred when
compared with the normal or low protein fed dogs (Nap et al, 1991).

Overnutrition in adults
In most Western countries, the major nutrition-related clinical problems in canine orthopedics
are due to excessive energy intake which will be stored as body fat in the normal dog. Obesity is
a common disease and the prevalence in dogs is approximately 28-44% (Edney & Smith, 1986).
Osteoarticular disorders are often associated with obesity. It is not clear if the high body weight
precedes orthopedic problems including osteoarthrosis, herniated intervertebral disc disease and
cruciate ligament rupture. The mechanical effect of increased body weight might cause a shear or
tear of stabilizing structures and an overload of the articular cartilage.

Skeleton

There have been a few studies investigating the relationship between ad libitum fed vs restricted
fed dogs and osteoarthritis (OA). In two groups of Labradors, litter mates of the same gender were
pair fed, i.e. one group ad libitum, the other 75% of the ad libitum amount. Housing, food and
maintenance were the same, except for the amount of food and as a consequence the body weight
which was an average 32 kg for the ad libitum dogs and 23 kg for
the restricted fed dogs. At 5 years of age, 12 of 23 of the ad libitum fed dogs and 3 of 23 of the restricted fed dogs had OA of the
hip joints. By 8 years of age, 12 of 23 of the ad libitum fed dogs
and 2 of 23 of the restricted fed dogs had OA in multiple joints
(Kealy et al, 1997; Kealy et al, 2000; Smith et al, 2001). OA in
multiple joints (including hips, elbows and shoulders) was seen
more frequently in overweight dogs than in slim litter mates
(Kealy et al, 1997).

© Renner

The pathophysiology behind the high incidence of OA in overweight dogs can be mechanical, but also hormonal as a decreased
growth hormone level was demonstrated in these overweight dogs
(Hazewinkel et al, 1999).

In Labrador puppies, an appropriate diet during growth
helps limit weight gain in the adult dog.
352

Young animals have a high requirement for calcium to mineralize newly formed cartilage and
osteoid. In Great Danes the daily calcium deposited in the skeleton can be as high as 225-900 mg
calcium/kg body weight (Hazewinkel et al, 1991). During growth, the calcium requirement largely depends on the stage of growth (i.e. the age of the puppy) and its growth rate (i.e. the
expected adult size and weight).
In miniature Poodles, 3.3 g calcium per kg diet (DMB) [corresponding to 140 mg per kg BW per
day] did not cause any skeletal abnormalities. In comparison, Great Dane puppies receiving 5.5 g
calcium per kg diet (DMB) [150-250 mg per kg BW per day] in the same research setting, with
the research diet right after weaning, developed severe osteoporosis with pathological fractures
(Hazewinkel et al, 1985; Nap et al, 1993) with a growth rate exceeding that of the control puppies
fed with a diet containing 11 g calcium per kg diet (DMB) [300-500 mg per kg BW per
day] (Figure 3).

Excess calcium intake
> Clinical observations(Figure 3)

The series of studies in Great Danes have demonstrated that daily food intake of calcium rich diets
lead to hyperplasia of calcitonin (CT) producing cells, reduced osteoclastic activity and disturbed
endochondral ossification (Nunez et al, 1974; Hazewinkel et al, 1985). A decreased remodeling of
the proximal femur (i.e. a delayed antetorsion) was observed in a group of Great Danes, a breed
not particularly prone to HD, fed an ad libitum diet rich in calcium (Hedhammar et al, 1974).
Others described delayed skeletal maturation in both Great Danes and in Poodles fed a diet with
high calcium content (i.e. 3.3% calcium on a dry matter basis) when compared with controls fed
a diet according to NRC (1974) guidelines (Voorhout & Hazewinkel, 1987a; Nap et al, 1993a).
Great Danes raised on diets with an increased calcium and phosphorus level (3.3 and 3.0% respectively [i.e. 1240 mg calcium per kg BW per day], in comparison with controls on 1.1% and
0.9% respectively [i.e. 400 mg calcium per kg BW per day]) starting at the age of weaning, developed disturbances in endochondral ossification in the growth plates of the distal radius or ulna.
As a consequence, elbow incongruity developed either due to a severe disturbance of growth in
length of the radius, or due to a severe radius curvus syndrome with disturbed growth in the length of the ulna (Hazewinkel et al, 1985; Schoenmakers et al, 2000). The
latter may coincide with an ununited anconeal process or the painOSTEOCHONDROSIS OF THE PROXIMAL HUMERUS
ful distraction cubiti, and will all lead to OA of the elbow joint.
In another study, Great Danes fed diets differing only in calcium
content, the higher calcium diet group showed progressively more
severe disturbances of osteochondrosis in the proximal humerus as
well as in growth plates of long bones and of non-weight bearing (i.e.
ribs) areas (Hazewinkel et al, 1985).

Different research groups have investigated the influence of nutrition on the manifestation of skeletal disease in
large and giant breed puppies. These graphs (Royal Canin, 2004), account for the quantity of calcium and
energy ingested by puppies at 2 and 5 months in the different studies. Several studies show that high calcium
consumption can have deleterious effects on the skeleton, particularly in large breed dogs.

In young dogs, calcium (Ca) is absorbed in the intestine by means of both uncontrolled passive
diffusion and active, controlled absorption. Puppies less than 6 months of age are unable to protect themselves from an excess of calcium (Tryfonidou et al, 2002b); during weaning at least 50%
of the calcium is absorbed whatever the quantity ingested (Hazewinkel et al, 1991) (Figure 4).
Great Danes raised on a food according to the NRC (1974) recommended 11 g calcium per kg
diet (DMB) [0.5 g per kg BW per day] absorbed 45-60% (260-300 mg/kg/d) of the ingested amount
of Ca, whereas puppies with triple that amount of in their diet, absorbed 23-43% (115215 mg/kg/d). Thus puppies fed the high calcium diet absorbed considerably higher amounts of
calcium.
Intake of food, and especially of Ca, causes the release of gastrointestinal hormones, some of which
will cause calcitonin (CT) release from the thyroid glands. In the growing animal, chronic high
calcium intake will cause chronic hypercalcitoninism (Hedhammar et al, 1974; Hazewinkel et al,
1985) which prevents calcium release from the skeleton by decreasing bone resorbing osteoclastic activity. Remodeling of the skeleton cannot occur. The calcium absorbed will be routed to the
skeleton without influencing the concentration of calcium in the extracellular fluid at each meal.

The dog balances the small quantity of ingested calcium (e.g. all-meat
diet) with a very large active absorption (red line). When the calcium
content in the diet increases too much, active absorption decreases but
the puppy continues to passively absorb at least 30-40% of the
calcium ingested (green line). Finally, when the puppy is fed a very
high-calcium diet, total absorption represent 40-50% of the calcium
ingested (blue line).

There is no ideal calcium content relative to age, but there is a
safety zone.
To feed a 2 month-old large-breed puppy as safely as possible,
it is advisable to give it between 260 and 830 mg of
calcium/kg/day.
At 5 months, the calcium safety zone should be lowered:
between 210 and 540 mg of calcium/kg/day.

Skeleton

The recommended calcium allowance for a growing puppy
according to NRC 2006 is 3.0 grams of calcium/ 1000 kcal
Metabolizable Energy (ME) or 0.5 g of calcium/ kg of body
weight/ day. The NRC 2006 minimum calcium requirement
for growing puppies is 2 g/1000 kcal or 0.37 g of calcium / kg
body weight / day. This should be appropriate for all breeds
and sizes. Compilation of the previously mentioned studies
suggests that there is a safety zone for calcium intake at which
osteoarticular diseases do not develop. This safety zone would
be 260-830 mg of calcium/ kg / day for puppies at 2 months
of age. The range would narrow slightly at 5 months of age
to 210-540 mg of calcium /kg/ day (Weber et al, 2000; Royal
Canin, 2004) (Figure 5).

Although it is not fully understood if calcium plays a direct
role in disturbing chondrocyte maturation, or if it is mediated by CT and/or a relative deficiency of other minerals at a
cellular level, there is little doubt on the deleterious effect of
high calcium intake on endochondral ossification, with
osteochondrosis as a consequence.

FIGURE 6 - LINEAR ABSORPTION OF CALCIUM

Calcium absorption in the
intestine (mmol/kg of
body weight by day)

(From Tryfonidou & coll, 2002)

There is a linear relationship in young
growing dogs between the calcium
content of the food and of calcium
intake (Vi) and the true calcium
absorption (Va) in the intestine.
Excess calcium in the diet will not
be secreted but will be absorbed and
stored in the skeleton.

1. In adult dogs and puppies calcium absorption
takes place not only via an active mechanism,
but also via a process of passive diffusion
(Figure 6), dependent on the concentration
gradient. In puppies, passive absorption is
however more important than in the adult
dog, where it is a minor phenomenon.
As a consequence, there is higher calcium
absorption from higher biologically available
calcium diets, both in small and large breed
dogs.
2. Even calcium excess at the time of partial
weaning (i.e. from 3-6 weeks of age) causes
hypertrophy of the calcitonin producing cells
with consequences in later life. All large
breed dogs with higher calcium intakes as
weaning puppies developed enostosis at
the age of 3-4 months.
3. Excess calcium as well as excess calcium and
phosphorous, starting at the age of weaning
(6 weeks of age) caused severe signs of
osteochondrosis as well as radius curvus
syndrome in large breed dogs.

356

4. Excess calcium starting at 3 weeks of age
caused hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia,
and very low concentrations of parathyroid
hormone. The skeleton revealed signs of
hypophosphatemic rickets, i.e. widened
growth plates and thin cortices.
5. Calcium deficiency occurs sooner in large than
in small breed dogs: 0.55% Ca [i.e. 250 mg
Ca per kg BW per day] DMB caused nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism (NSHP) in
2 months-old Great Dane puppies but not in
Miniature Poodles fed at 0.33% [i.e. 170 mg
Ca per kg BW per day] Ca DMB. NSHP in
Poodles was seen under 0.05% Ca [i.e. less
than 25 mg Ca per kg BW per day] DMB.
6. In calcium deficiency, the proportion of ingested calcium which is actively absorbed versus
passively diffused increases, although the total
amount of calcium which is absorbed may still
be less than required. In order to keep plasma
calcium concentration constant, osteoclasts
start to remove bone. Chronic calcium deficiency causes NSHP with severe calcium
resorption of the skeleton and eventually
pathological fractures (i.e. greenstick and
compression fractures).

7. Vitamin D deficiency, even with adequate
dietary content of calcium and phosphorus,
leads to rickets.
8. Excessive vitamin D intake does not lead
immediately to increased calcium absorption
due to metabolic adaptations of vitamin D in
the body, but it may cause osteochondrosis
and radius curvus syndrome in young dogs of
large breeds.

The bones grow primarily during the first few months. The second phase corresponds to muscular
development, which continues until adult weight has been reached.

Osteoarticular diseases are particularly common
in large-breed and giant-breed puppies. Calcium
excess (3.3%) and deficiency (0.55%) have in
turn been incriminated as factors promoting
skeletal developmental problems. The object of
this study was to evaluate the influence of these
two calcium levels, by remaining within the
regular calcium-value range in puppy food.
Six Great Dane bitches (GD) and six giant
Schnauzers (GS) were split into two groups
(3GDs + 3 GSs) from the age of 9 weeks. These
two groups were raised on two foods composed
of the same ingredients (C08 and C15); the only
difference was the calcium (0.8% vs 1.5%)and
phosphorus (0.6% vs 1.23%) content in C08
and C15 respectively (identical metabolizable
energy (ME) value: 3800 kcal/kg).
Between 10 and 40-46 weeks parameters including body weight, height to withers, length of
ulna and tibia, serum calcium and phosphate
concentrations, alkaline phosphate levels and
IGF-1 were measured.

Energy ingested was identical for all the dogs.
Energy intake increased gradually from
1400 kcal ME/day in week 10 to 3500 kcal
ME/day in week 46 for the GDs versus 6101800 kcal ME/day for the GSs. The calcium
consumption was respectively 400 and 200250 mg/kg/day in the puppies that receive the
C15 and C08 diet.
No difference was observed in bodyweight or
body condition between the two groups of puppies. Within the two breeds the differences in
tibia and ulna length according to dietary group,
were not significant. There was no significant
difference between the groups with respect to
the size of the GDs (from 40 cm in wk 10 to
77 cm in wk 46), or in the GSs (from 33 cm to
58 cm in wk 46).

No particular health problems were revealed.
Orthopedic examinations did not provide any
evidence of clinical difference between the dogs.
No painful areas or biomechanical problems
were detected. Mild osteochondrosis lesions
were transiently shown in the two groups.
This study concluded that there were no skeletal
developmental abnormalities detected in giantbreed puppies when they consumed a diet
containing 0.8% or 1.5% calcium.

Skeleton

Skeletal radiographs and orthopedic examinations were also conducted regularly to evaluate
the position of the legs and the conformation
and to identify any lameness.

Osteochondrosis
Osteochondrosis is a disturbance of endochondral ossification, characterized by an abnormal maturation of chondrocytes and therefore a delay in cartilage mineralization (Figures 7 & 8). If the
disturbance in endochondral ossification occurs in articular cartilage, osteochondritis dissecans
(OCD) may be a consequence. In OCD, part of the articular cartilage becomes detached and may
be fragmented, mineralized or even ossified
together with inflammation of both the joint
FIGURE 7 - OSTEOCHONDROSIS LESION
and the endochondral bone in the area of the
cartilage lesion.
Osteochondrosis is the result of an anomaly
in the development of growing cartilage: the
ossification process is altered and we see cartilage
retention and thickening.
(The arrow points to a zone of abnormally
thick cartilage.) Osteochondrosis may develop
into osteochondritis dissecans when a fragment
of cartilage is freed in the joint.
Osteochondrosis is stimulated by a chronic
excess of calcium in the diet.

The disturbance in endochondral ossification
can also occur in growth plate cartilage, with
irregular growth plates, enlarged cartilage
cores and decreased growth in length as a
consequence. In addition, the disturbance in
endochondral ossification can manifest in a
delay in ossification of the secondary ossification centers. Disturbances in growth plates
which lead to clinical manifestations of osteo-

The intercellular material between the
columns of cartilage cells mineralizes when
a certain stage of maturity is reached.
Chondrocytes are then sealed off from
their nutritional resources (i.e. synovia in
articular cartilage and epiphyseal vessels
in growth plate cartilage) and then die and
disintegrate. Now endothelial cells of
the capillaries invade the non-calcified
horizontal septa between the chondrocytes
and the lacuna of the disintegrated

chondrocytes. Osteoblasts align themselves
along the partially resorbed cartilaginous
cores and deposit osteoid. Primary
spongiosa, i.e. mineralized cartilage
surrounded by mineralized osteoid, can be
eroded by osteoclasts to become cancellous
bone (more oriented osteoid fibers without
a cartilaginous core). When present in the
metaphyseal area of growing bone, it may
be eroded locally to become the medullary
cavity.

In osteochondrosis due to a disturbance
of cartilage-cell maturation, mineralization
of the intercellular substance is delayed.
Therefore the cascade of events, including
chondrocyte death, capillary ingrowth,
osteoblast introduction and bone
formation, will not take place. This causes
elongated cartilage columns in the articular
cartilage as well as in the growth plate
cartilage. This thickened cartilage is
vulnerable to microtrauma.

3 - Developmental orthopedic diseases associated with nutritional excesses

chondrosis (including bilateral radius curvus syndrome or rear leg exorotation) are seen predominately in giant breed dogs. Detachment of the anconeal process of the ulna or the supraglenoid
process of the scapula can also occur.
> Diagnosis

Dogs with osteochondrosis, without detachment of cartilage, will not be clinical. However with
OCD, dogs may exhibit lameness, pain upon hyperextension and flexion of the affected joint and
joint effusion. The joints most commonly affected are shoulder, elbow, stifle and hock. Dogs will
also not be clinical in cases of osteochondrosis in the growth plate when the retained cartilage
core is small or temporary. In longitudinal radiological studies of the distal growth plate of the ulna
of Great Danes, a slight flattening or indentation could be seen at five months of age. However,
when a severe flattening of the metaphyseal area develops, or a deep cartilage core can be seen,
impaired growth in length of the radius and ulna can be expected (Figure 9). This can result in
radius curvus syndrome (short ulna, curved radius and valgus deformation of the feet).
With clinically suspected OCD, a thorough clinical and radiographic investigation will suffice in
most cases. Radiographs may reveal subchondral sclerosis bordering an indentation of the articular surface. Some cases may require additional diagnostics such as arthrocentesis, contrast arthrogram, arthroscopy, other imaging techniques and/or exploratory surgery of the joint for definitive
diagnosis.
> Epidemiology

Osteochondrosis is primarily seen in large breeds of dogs (i.e. more than 25 kg adult body weight),
and more frequently in male and fast growing female dogs. The disease is seen in a variety of breeds
with Great Dane, Labrador, Golden Retriever, Newfoundland and Rottweiler being the breeds at
highest risk (Milton, 1983; Slater et al, 1991; Van Bree, 1991).
Osteochondrosis appears to have a predisposition for specific locations in each breed. OCD lesions
are seen most commonly in:
- the shoulder and stifle joints of Great Danes
- the shoulder, elbow and hock joints of Labradors and Golden Retrievers
- the elbow joints of Newfoundlands
- the shoulder and hock joints of Rottweilers (Slater et al, 1991).

Skeleton

In one study, 66% of the dogs with OCD had more than one joint affected; in 5% three joints
were affected (Slater et al, 1991). Although histologically osteochondrosis can be diagnosed also
in non-weight bearing growth plates like that of the rib, microtrauma may play a significant role
in causing the fissures as can be concluded from the fact that osteochondrosis dissecans is mostly
seen on convex, weight bearing areas.

Figure 9 - A mild retained cartilage core
may disappear spontaneously.

> Pathophysiology

Osteochondrosis is a multifactorial disease common in large breeds in which heredity and nutrition play a significant role. A variety of studies have been performed to elucidate the role of nutrition in the manifestation of osteochondrosis (Table 2). These studies support the conclusion that
chronic intake of excess energy or of a food enriched with calcium, with or without changes in
other nutrients, plays a significant role in the development and manifestation of osteochondrosis
in dogs of large breeds. Minor changes of endochondral ossification, without clinical significance,
have also been demonstrated in miniature Poodles raised on a food with high calcium content.
Please refer to sections: Overnutrition in growth and Excess calcium intake; for further information.

359

Dietary correction at an early stage may positively influence the spontaneous resolution of disturbed endochondral ossification (Voorhout & Hazewinkel, 1987a). Osteochondrosis in cartilage and
growth plates could disappear, but dietary modification will not normalize cases of OCD in which
there is severe detached cartilage, or where a more severe curvature of the radius exists (Olsson,
1982). Surgical correction will be indicated in most of these cases (Figure 10).
Dietary correction entails a decrease in intake of energy, calcium and vitamins to the recommended levels for dogs. Fast growing puppies should be weighed and have their body condition score assessed frequently (every 2-4 weeks) to monitor their growth. If a puppy is growing too quickly or becoming overweight, its energy intake will need to be decreased without
unbalancing the other nutrients. No pharmacological or other medications are known to support the nutritional management.

Osteochondrosis will not develop into OCD in all cases. Based on controlled studies where both
shoulder joints were radiographed, it can be concluded that, although 45-65% of the dogs had
radiographically detectable abnormal contours of the humeral head, only 3-5% were clinically
affected on both sides (Van Bree, 1991). When detached, the period of lameness can be shortened as well as most probable the secondary changes of the joint minimized with surgical or arthroscopic treatment.

(B) The craniocaudal view shows that the radial
head does not run parallel with the distal
humerus indicating elbow incongruity as well
as an indication of a fragmented coronoid
process (FCP). The final diagnosis is:
elbow incongruity and FCP with severe OA.

> Diagnosis

The typical age of the patient suffering from ED is 4 -10 months of age, although there is an increasing frequency of dogs with elbow pain (without any signs of OA on radiographs) seen at more
than 3 years of age. Upon examination in almost 50% of the cases the paw of the affected leg is
externally rotated and slightly abducted. On palpation the elbow is often effusive. The range of
motion (ROM) of the elbow joint can be decreased in advanced cases. Subtle crepitation can be
appreciated at an early stage. In an UAP, there is crepitation and pain on firm hyperextension of
the elbow joint. In FCP and/or OCD, crepitation and pain reaction can be evoked at prolonged
hyperextension, especially when the radius and ulna are
externally rotated at the same time (i.e. supination).
Diagnosis of ED can be confirmed by radiography. Bony
union between the anconeal process and the olecranon
should be complete at the age of 16-20 weeks (Sjöström et
al, 1995). When a radiolucent area is present at an older age
it is suggestive of an anconeal process which is not united,
i.e. an UAP. This may be due to a partial or complete separation in the cartilage between the anconeal process and
olecranon, which is preferentially demonstrated on a
mediolateral flexed radiographic view. Sclerosis at the fracture site and osteophytes at the margins of the joint can be
visible at a later stage. For grading OA of the elbow joint,
see the web page of the International Elbow Working
Group: www.iewg-vet.org.

ED can be separated into different disease entities including ununited anconeal process (UAP),

Most entities of ED occur bilaterally in 30-70% of the cases, and therefore both
elbow joints should be investigated, even in case of unilateral lameness. In case
there are no radiographic abnormalities visible in dogs with clinical lameness,
and other causes of front leg lameness are excluded (including panosteitis, OCD
in the shoulder joint, sesamoid fractures, and biceps tendon pain) auxiliary techniques including computed tomography, bone scintigraphy, and arthroscopy can
be of value.

Certain breeds appear to be at risk for ED (Table 3). Depending on the specific
sub-population and the method of investigation, elbow dysplasia is seen in 4650% of the Rottweilers, 36-70% of the Bernese Mountain Dogs, 12-14% of the
Labradors, 15-20% of the Golden Retrievers, 30% of Newfoundland dogs, and

Early surgical intervention has the best prognosis for the future status of the joint in lame dogs.
In a study, with a follow-up period ranging from 0.5-8 years (mean 2.7 years) the success rate was
78% in a group of 64 Retrievers (with 67.8% males) operated at a young age. Only 33% of the
conservatively treated dogs with a FCP (i.e. low body weight and controlled activity but no surgery), were not lame (Meij et al, 1996). This stresses the importance of an early diagnosis and surgical treatment. Results with arthroscopy are comparable, depending on availability of the equipment and the skills of the surgeon.
Elbow incongruity (INC) due to a short radius is frequently seen in Bernese Mountain dogs
(BMD), but also other breeds (Retrievers, Napolitan Mastiff) and dogs raised on food supplemented with minerals may be affected. A random study in the Dutch BMD population revealed that

FRAGMENTATION OF THE MEDIAL PORTION

3 - Developmental orthopedic diseases associated with nutritional excesses

OCD of the medial humeral condyle is best assessed on anterior posterior medial
oblique (APMO) views (Voorhout & Hazewinkel, 1987b). In a small number of
cases a calcified flap can be seen located near the indentation of the medial
condyle. In FCP, the fragment can only be seen on high quality films when the
coronoid process is displaced cranially (as in Bernese Mountain Dogs), whereas
the cranial alignment of the ulna at the level of the medial coronoid can give an
indication of fragmentation. Secondary signs such as osteophytes and sclerosis of
the semilunar notch can help to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Small osteophytes
are especially visible on mediolateral views of the flexed elbow at the dorsal margin of the anconeal process. Extended views help to visualize osteophytes at the
radial head, and AP views demonstrate irregularities at the medial aspect of the
humerus as well as the ulna (Figure 11).

3 - Developmental orthopedic diseases associated with nutritional excesses

72% of the dogs had INC (Hazewinkel et al, 1995). The joint surface supporting the humerus is
decreased in the case of a short radius. This leads to an increased pressure on the remaining joint
surface, e.g. the lateral and medial coronoid process. Congruity is restored after the removal of the
FCP at the same surgical intervention.
> The role of nutrition in ED

A combination of FCP and OCD has been explained by Olsson (1993) as a disturbance of endochondral ossification and as such expressions of the same disease. Osteochondrosis is seen more
frequently in certain breeds and sub-populations and can be aggravated by high food intake and
excessive calcium intake (Hazewinkel, 1993) as well as by oversupplementation of balanced food
with vitamin D (Tryfonidou et al, 2002a). Please refer to sections: Overnutrition in growth and
Excess calcium intake; for further information. The frequency and severity of osteochondrosis
can thus be prevented by dietary management, including a food with adequate and appropriate calcium to energy ratio, a quantitative restriction of food intake, and without adding vitamin D to a balanced diet.

Hip Dysplasia (HD)
Hip dysplasia is a common, heritable developmental orthopedic disease. Studies have shown that
dysplastic dogs are born with normal hips, but develop HD as a result of the disparity between the
development of the bony part of the hip joint and its supporting soft tissues; ligaments, joint capsule and muscles (Alexander, 1992). This occurs during the first six months of life, during which
time the tissues are soft and plastic with an elastic limit.
Rottweiler, German Shepherd, Golden
Retriever, and Labrador Retriever
(top to bottom) are breeds predisposed
to coxo-femoral dysplasia. They
are also the breeds most likely to be
screened for this disease.

> Diagnosis

A diagnosis of HD is made on the basis of the history and the clinical signs, including stiffness on
rising, “bunny hopping”, pain and lameness of the rear limbs, and pain reaction or crepitation
upon manipulation of the hip joints. Clinically, the dog
may show pain at different stages of development of HD.
In the immature dog, stretching of the joint capsule and
microfractures of the cartilage will elicit pain, whereas in
the mature dog overuse of the arthritic joint will result in
general signs of arthrosis. Such signs include pain upon
rising, warming out during exercise (initial stiffness which
improves with walking), decreased range of movement
and worsening of signs after rest following heavy exercise
(Hazewinkel, 1992). Laxity of the hip joint can be tested
by abduction of the proximal femur, preferably in a nonweight bearing position:
(1) using one hand as a fulcrum, medial to the proximal
femur with the dog in lateral recumbency, and medial
pressure of the stifle joint;

Subluxation of the hip joint can be diagnosed by putting
medially-directed force on the greater trochanter.
Radiographs in extension (Figure 12), as well as more
specific views related to the acetabular rim (Slocum & Slocum, 1992) or joint laxity (Smith et al, 1990) can be
conclusive in diagnosing joint laxity, incongruency, subchondral sclerosis and osteophyte formation.

HD is a hereditary abnormality commonly seen in certain
breeds (i.e. St Bernards, Rottweilers, Newfoundlands,
Bernese Mountain Dogs, German Shepherd, Labrador
and Golden Retrievers) and infrequently in other breeds
(i.e. Afghan Hounds, Shetland Sheepdogs, Malamutes
and Huskies) (Corley, 1992).
There are 136 breeds ranked according to frequency of
hip dysplasia on the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals
(OFA’s) website: www.offa.org. These breeds have had at
least 100 evaluations between January 1974 and December 2003. The results of a retrospective study using the
OFA data base have shown that there has been improvement in the hip joint phenotype of dogs in the United
States. Certain breeds have shown an increase in the percentage of dogs classified as having excellent hip joint
phenotype and there has been a decrease in the percentage of dogs classified as having HD. German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers and Rottweilers have shown the greatest
increase in percentage of dogs classified as having excellent hip joint phenotype and the greatest
submission screening rate. Rottweilers have shown the greatest improvement (Morgan et al, 2000).
Even if these figures are biased by the tendency to pass on the best hips for official judging and
not to offer the bad ones, it will help to use only the best dogs with the best hips as breeding stock.

> Pathophysiology

In the canine hip joint, both the femoral head and the acetabulum are mainly cartilaginous at
birth. Bone formation, and a change in position of the femoral head in relation to the femoral
shaft, will take place via endochondral ossification and osteoclastic activity respectively. In HD,
joint laxity results in an incongruent hip joint where the dorsomedial part of the femoral head
and the acetabular rim are in contact, while supporting almost half the body weight when walking. This causes microfractures and deformation of the acetabular rim, erosions of the cartilage
and deformation of the subchondral bone (Fox et al, 1987). The associated pathological changes
are joint effusion, stretching and thickening of the joint capsule and the round ligament, as well
as osteophyte formation.

joints of three different dogs

There are several dietary factors which play a role in hip joint development and hip joint overload, both of clinical significance in canine HD. Excess energy intake has been previously discussed. Heavy body weight will cause overloading of the cartilaginous skeleton, including the hip
joints. This could be a significant factor, which may help to explain the increased frequency and
severity of HD in overweight dogs.
Increased calcium intake has also been previously discussed. It can be concluded that excessive dietary calcium intake decreases maturation of the hip joint conformation as well as of the vulnerable cartilaginous template of the skeleton. This may coincide with overloading of the hip joint

Skeleton

Environmental factors, which are believed to influence the development of HD, have yet to be
elucidated. Research has shown that diet has both quantitatively and qualitatively, a significant
effect on the development of HD (Kealy et al, 1992). Diet will not cure HD or alter the genetic
status of the offspring in this respect, but it can influence the phenotypic expression of HD by
optimizing the development of the hip joints of those animals potentially at risk. Diet can also
play a role in conservative treatment in those dogs where HD has already developed. Good control
of body weight will alleviate clinical signs.

which is too immature in its development for
the age and size of the dog and therefore, may
play a significant role in deformation of the hip
joint at an early age.

In the field of canine nutrition, there is now sufficient evidence to suggest that, within the
range of nutrient levels normally encountered in
practice, it is not the calcium to phosphorus
ratio, but the absolute calcium amount in the
daily ration which determines the occurrence of
1- Pelvis
skeletal abnormalities (Hazewinkel et al, 1991;
2- Femoral head
Nap, 1993). A high dietary phosphorus content

may bind more calcium in the intestine to form

Stage 3
non absorbable complexes, but this is possibly
only the case with non-absorbable phytates. A
highly absorbable salt (as is present in bone meal) will cause the same skeletal effects as excessive calcium alone (Hazewinkel et al, 1991).
Electrolytes are present in body fluids including synovia. Differences in circulating cations (Na+,
K+, Ca++ and Mg++) and anions (Cl-, H2PO4- and the SO4- present in amino acids) influence acidbase balance. The influence of electrolytes on the osmolality of body fluids as well as on acid-base
balance may play a role in the development of HD in young dogs.
Mean osmolality in synovial fluid from normal hip joints was significantly lower than that of synovia of hip joints of dysplastic retrievers (Olsewski et al, 1983). Whether this difference reflects the
cause of joint laxity or the result of hyperperfusion of the joint capsule of the arthritic joint needs
to be elucidated.

Skeleton

In another study (Kealy et al, 1993), the dietary content of Na+, K+ and Cl- ions differed (increased, increased and decreased, respectively) in the diets of three groups of dogs (n=177) of five
breeds (St Bernards, German Shepherds, Coonhounds, English Pointers and Labrador Retrievers)
originating from 27 litters. In these dogs, joint laxity was observed by the measurement of the Norberg angle on radiographs taken at 30 and 105 weeks of age. However, the acid-base balance and
electrolyte content of body fluids were not measured. It was found that the dogs on the dry dog
food (moisture <10%) with the low Na (0.32-0.43%), low K (0.39-0.70%) and high Cl (0.660.81%) content had a slight but statistically significant improvement in the Norberg angle when
compared with the other groups. Only the retrievers revealed a low Norberg angle of the hip joint,
irrespective of the diet. The clinical significance of these findings, the sensitivity and reproducibility of the radiographic procedure (Smith et al, 1990; Heyman et al, 1993), the influence of other
electrolytes playing a role in acid-base balance and osmolality (Lemann & Lennon, 1972) must all
be further investigated before the optimum electrolyte content of the food can be established. The
detrimental effects of prolonged dietary-induced acidosis on skeletal mineral content (Ching et al,
1989), however, imply that further studies in this area would be valuable.
Although not proven in research, vitamin D could play a role in the development of HD.
Although an increased vitamin D intake will not cause an increased absorption of calcium (see
section on Vitamin D), hypervitaminosis D has a detrimental effect on the process of endochondral ossification (Tryfonidou et al, 2003b) and as such on the growth and development of the hip
joint. Disturbances in cartilage differentiation may decrease the resistance of cartilage to physiological loading of the joint and lead to deformation of both femoral head and acetabular rim.

364

3 - Developmental orthopedic diseases associated with nutritional excesses

HD can develop in young, overfed dogs, even under conditions of relatively restricted activity.
This is most likely due to overstressing the elasticity of the periarticular tissues and the resulting
pathological cartilaginous and subchondral bone changes.
> Therapy

Overnutrition should be prevented by feeding to meet the dog’s energy requirements. The energy intake should be determined based on individual needs of the pet which are influenced by age,
breed, body weight and activity. Since excess calcium intake can be detrimental to hip joint development, puppies should be fed diets with an appropriate calcium level for their size and age. Commercial balanced diets are available which will satisfy the special energy and calcium requirements
of a fast growing puppy. These diets should never be supplemented with vitamins and minerals as
excesses may occur.

In the non surgical treatment of HD, both dietary measures and activity restriction should be
employed.

Other surgeries (Table 4) that can be performed when indicated include triple pelvic osteotomy (TPO), hip prosthesis and
excision arthroplasty (i.e. removal of the femoral head and
neck). TPO can be performed in dogs with severe hip laxity but
without deformation of the head and socket. Dogs with severe
hip dysplasia or severe deformation of head and/or acetabulum
due to OA or trauma are potential candidates for hip prosthesis. Excision arthroplasty is indicated in cases of severe joint
deformation and pain. The result of surgery is mainly dependent on the creation of smooth surface between the femur and
acetabulum, the weight of the dog (<20 kg), the musculature of
the dog (poorer with muscle atrophy), and early training (swimming).

Skeleton

In selected cases, development of the hip joint
in young growing dogs can be surgically optimized. In dogs of 8-13 weeks of age, symphysiodesis is advocated by some researchers. They
claim that the bottom of the pelvis does not
grow in width, whereas the dorsal aspect including the acetabular roof is not hindered. As a
consequence, the covering of the femoral heads
will improve after thermocauterization of the
symphysis pelvis. Myectomy of the pectineus
muscle is indicated in dogs with contraction of
these muscles, causing adduction of the hind
paws even to a degree that the feet are crossing.
This can be seen in young and adult dogs.
Short-term results may be spectacular, whereas
long term effects in regards to the development
of OA are not known.

Rest per se and weight loss can improve the clinical signs of HD in young and adult dogs, as
was observed by force plate measurements before and after a period of 3 months cage rest
(Hazewinkel, 1992).

3 - Developmental orthopedic diseases associated with nutritional excesses

Orthopedic diseases
due to decreased skeletal remodeling
Decreased skeletal remodeling may occur in two separate entities: canine wobbler syndrome and
enostosis, which are seen either alone or in conjunction with osteochondrosis.
> Diagnosis

Ataxia, non coordinated gait of the rear legs, delayed proprioceptive reflexes and pain reaction
upon extension of the neck are all signs which can be seen in young dogs of large breeds, with
canine wobbler syndrome. These signs appear at the age of 6 months, unlike the unrelated ataxia
in Doberman Pinchers which appears at the age of 6 years. Although not pathognomonic, the
presence of the crossed extensor reflex is of great help in making the diagnosis. The other findings
of a neurologic examination depend on the location of the lesion.
Figure 13 - Disproportionate
widening of the spinal canal causing
compression of the spinal cord.

Shifting lameness in dogs under two years of age is suggestive of enostosis (eosinophilic panosteitis). This occurs due to the fact that all long bones are affected, but will vary in their degree of
painfulness at any given time.

© HAW Hazewinkel

Plain radiographs are the initial diagnostic test.
Often additional imaging techniques such as myelography and CT need to be performed to determine
the exact location of the lesion in cases of canine
wobbler syndrome (Figure 13). Positive pain reactions upon deep palpation of bones, together with
radio-opaque areas in the medullary cavities, which
arise close to the nutrient foramina, are conclusive
for enostosis.
> Epidemiology

Canine wobbler syndrome has an increased incidence in Great Danes, Mastiffs and Irish Wolfhounds and is unrelated to the spondylolisthesis and consequent ligamentous hypertrophy seen in
the aged Doberman Pinscher. Enostosis occurs in a variety of dog breeds at a young age, particularly in the German Shepherd Dog.
> Pathophysiology
Skeleton

The etiology may be multifactorial, but the influence of diet has been demonstrated in rapidly growing dogs of large breed (Hedhammar et al, 1974; Hazewinkel et al, 1985). Skeletal growth occurs in
two ways: growth in length and modeling in shape. The latter includes an adaptation to changes in
body size, muscle-pull and body weight. The load of hydroxyapatite crystals may cause a shift in electrons which can influence osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. This and other still unexplained
mechanisms may form the basis of Wolff's law which states that “bone is laid down where it is needed”. However, the integrity of the skeleton is subordinate to calcium homeostasis, which includes
the strict regulation of calcium concentration in the extracellular fluid.
As previously discussed in the section on Excess calcium intake, a chronic excessive calcium intake will cause high calcium absorption in young dogs, especially of large breeds (Figure 6). Calcium
is not significantly excreted in the urine or via the endogenous fecal pathway, but is mainly routed
to the bone in these dogs. Nutritional hypercalcitoninism-induced decreased osteoclastic activity
occurs with a high calcium intake and bone remodeling is diminished. As a result adaptation of the
diameter of foramina to the proportional growth of the spinal cord or blood vessels may be delayed
and certain forms of canine wobbler syndrome or enostosis may occur.
Great Danes fed a diet with high calcium content (i.e. 2-3 times the recommended amount) displayed a delayed expansion of the cervical vertebral canal in proportion to the growth of the spinal
366

In dogs fed high calcium diets, a decreased endosteal osteoclastic resorption, together with an increase
in new periosteal bone formation has been observed (Hedhammar et al, 1974). The nutrient canals
and foramina of the cortex are often abnormal in shape; this may cause edema formation, and eventually fibrosis in the medullary cavity. Edema may also extend through the cortex and underneath
the periosteum, causing a loose periosteal attachment and/or excessive lamellar bone formation
(Figure 14).

© HAW Hazewinkel

Enostosis was radiologically confirmed in research animals at the age of 3-4 months given a gruel in
their period of partial weaning (i.e: 3-6 weeks of age) with an elevated calcium content, together
with the bitch milk. On the contrary, none of the control puppies (raised on a diet with 1% Ca
DMB) first as a gruel (3-6 weeks) and eventually as their sole food, revealed any clinical or radiological sign of enostosis (Hazewinkel et al, 2000).
> Therapy

Early dietary correction may halt the process of disproportionate remodelling of the skeleton.
Commercial diets providing an adequate amount of calcium and energy for the weight and age
of the dog should be instituted.
In canine wobbler syndrome, surgical decompression of the spinal cord may prevent further degeneration. Enostosis can be very painful and recurrent. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) can be prescribed. Enostosis will heal without long term effects however, relapses may
occur until the dog is 2 years of age.

cord. Compression of the spinal cord causes myelin degeneration of both the ascending and descending tracts, the extent of which is related to the severity of clinical and imaging signs (Hedhammar
et al, 1974; Hazewinkel et al, 1985).

to nutritional deficiencies (nutritional
secondary hyperparathyroidism,
rickets)

© HAW Hazewinkel

Skeleton

Pathological fractures, including folding of the cortical bones, compression of the cancellous bone
spiculae and deformation of flat bones can occur secondary to nutritional deficiencies of calcium
(nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism NSHP) or vitamin D (rickets in young dogs and
osteomalacia in mature dogs). Along with pathological fractures, other clinical signs of the rarely seen rickets or hypovitaminosis D can include lethargy, muscle weakness and bulging metaphyseal areas of radius-ulna and ribs. Chronic progressive demineralization of skeletal bone with resultant loss of teeth and/or pathological and/or compression fractures can be the consequences of
NSHP. As well, due to constant muscle pull on the pelvic bones, calcaneus, scapula and other
prominences, the weakened bone can become misshaped. In some locations this can be seen or
palpated.

Diagnosis
Developmental orthopedic diseases secondary to nutritional deficiencies may be suspected based
on dietary history and physical examination. The most practical and inexpensive diagnostic technique is radiographic investigation of the long bones and axial skeleton (Riser & Shirer, 1964; Voorhout & Hazewinkel, 1987a). Although it has been demonstrated that under standardized conditions,
a mineral loss of at least 30% is required before NSHP lesions are noticeable radiographically, the
abnormal alignment due to greenstick and compression fractures, as well as bowing of bones due
to the constant pull, is obvious. In addition, the growth plate has a normal width and the metaphyseal area is usually more radio-opaque than the rest of the bone (Figure 15). Radiographic

changes of the radius and ulna can be diagnostic for rickets. Typical findings include a
thin cortex, larger diameter of the medullary cavity, bowed long bones and an increase
in width of the growth plates (Figure 16).

16B

Diagnosis can also be supported by the measurement of vitamin D metabolites and parathyroid hormone (PTH). With rickets, levels of vitamin D, 25-OH vitamin D and 24,25OH2 vitamin D will be low, whereas the 1,25 OH2 vitamin D metabolite will be in the
low to normal range. In contrast, elevated PTH, increased 1,25 OH2 vitamin D and low
25-OH vitamin D may occur with NSHP. Serum biochemistry panels may also show some
abnormalities with these diseases. Serum phosphate concentrations are strongly influenced by nutritional intake and this factor must be considered in the interpretation of the
value. Alkaline phosphatase, abundantly available in osteoblasts and liver cells, will be
markedly elevated whenever there is increased bone cell activity (including growth).
Even with a low dietary calcium intake, serum calcium concentrations are kept constant.
However with hypovitaminosis D, serum calcium concentrations can be in the low to
normal range and serum phosphorus concentrations can be low with concurrent increased urinary phosphorus. The latter can be explained by hypocalcemia induced hyperparathyroidism, which will decrease the maximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus.
Figure 16 - Hypovitaminosis D (rickets)
(16A) Thin cortex, large diameter of medullary
cavity and increased width of the growth plates
are typical for hypovitaminosis D (rickets).
(16B) Six weeks later, the radiograph shows
good mineralization of both the cortices and
the growth plates.

Epidemiology

A major risk factor for development of these diseases appears to be diet. Rickets or hypovitaminosis D, rarely seen in puppies, can occur when a dog has been raised on lean meat
immediately after weaning. Home-made meat-rich diets, especially those prepared from
cardiac and skeletal muscle can be deficient in phosphorus and calcium resulting in
NSHP. In addition, NSHP may also be induced when the diet meets all other requirements but is deficient only in its calcium content, and cannot therefore support proper
skeletal mineralization. Poor availability of calcium due to complex formation with phytic acid,
oxalate, high phosphate content of the food or inadequate vitamin D may cause the same symptoms.
Other risk factors may be breed and breed size. Under experimental conditions, pathological fractures may occur in small breed dogs when fed a diet with extremely low calcium content, whereas
Great Danes may exhibit pathological fractures when the dietary calcium content is 50% of the
recommended amount. In adult dogs, Krook et al (1971) described severe hyperparathyroidism in
adult Beagles fed 1.2 mg calcium per kg diet (DMB), whereas in adult Golden Retrievers fed a
diet with 1 g calcium per kg diet (Hedhammar et al, 1980) and adult mongrels fed a diet with 1.3
g per kg diet did not develop clinical signs of osteoporosis (Gershoff et al, 1958).

Skeleton

4 - Developmental orthopedic diseases due to nutritional deficiencies

16A

Pathophysiology
Up to 95% of ingested calcium may be absorbed following long term feeding of a calcium deficient diet
(Gershoff et al, 1958; Hazewinkel et al, 1991). This increase in absorption efficiency is achieved by
an increase in formation of the most active metabolite of vitamin D. This metabolite is formed in
the kidney under the influence of PTH (Figure 17).
A low calcium uptake stimulates PTH synthesis and secretion. Both elevated vitamin D3 levels
and hyperparathyroidism will increase the number, as well as the activity, of the bone resorbing
osteoclasts (Hazewinkel et al, 1987a). Osteoclasis will be augmented at the sites where osteoclasts
are normally active in young growing bone, i.e. at the medullary aspect of cortical bone and at the
periphery of the cancellous bone spiculae. The circulating calcium level is kept constant and is
sufficient not to disturb other process in the body, including mineralization of the newly formed
cartilage of growth plates.

After ingestion of vitamin D3 in food, it is hydroxylated
into 25(OH)D3 in the liver and subsequently to
1,25(OH)2D3 or 24,25(OH)2 D3 in various organs,
mainly the kidneys. The second hydroxylation takes
place under the influence of 1-α-hydroxylase and
24-hydroxylase, respectively, whose activity is stimulated (+) or decreased (-) by a variety of hormones:
parathyroid hormone (PTH), Growth Hormone
(GH), Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-I) and
minerals (Calcium-Ca and Phosphorus-P). In
addition to specific actions on intestine and kidneys
1,25(OH)2D3 acts together with 24,25 (OH)2D3
on cartilage and bone cells.

Skeleton

Vitamin D metabolites stimulate calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestine and reabsorption in the renal tubules as well as stimulate osteoclasts and are necessary for mineralization of
the newly formed osteoid and cartilage. Vitamin D is absorbed in the intestine as one of the fat
soluble vitamins, transported to and hydroxylated in the liver and then further hydroxylated in
the kidney to 24,25 OH2 vitamin D or 1,25 OH2 vitamin D (Fraser, 1980). It has been demonstrated that dogs do not synthesize adequate vitamin D in their skin when radiated with ultraviolet B-light, unlike herbivores and other omnivores (Table 5). Under experimental conditions,
young dogs developed the signs of rickets when fed a vitamin D deficient diet with adequate

FIGURE 17 - VITAMIN D METABOLISM

All dogs need vitamin D in their diets, since dogs are not able to synthesize adequate vitamin D
in their skin under the influence of sunlight. The vitamin D content of balanced dog foods is enough to treat
(and prevent) hypovitaminosis D in dogs.
Vitamin D deficiency (even when the calcium and phosphorus content of the diet is adequate) will cause rickets: bowed legs,
increased width in the growth plates, thin cortices
Vitamin D excess (100 x the recommended content of 500 IU/kg food) does not increase absorption of calcium and phosphorus in
the intestine, but causes severe disturbances in endochondral ossification (osteochondrosis)
Vitamin D intoxication causes increased absorption and bone resorption and thus increased calcium and phosphorus blood levels,
with mineralization of lungs and kidneys and eventually death.

amounts of calcium, phosphorus and other constituents according to the NRC 1974 guidelines.
Daily exposure with ultraviolet B-light did not prevent or heal the hypovitaminosis D (Hazewinkel et
al, 1987b).
Therefore, dogs rely on the vitamin D in foodstuffs
including liver, fish, egg, milk and commercial
available dog foods to meet their requirements
(Table 6). Synthesis of the most active metabolite
(1,25-OH2 vitamin D) is stimulated by the influence of PTH, low serum calcium and phosphorus
levels and during growth, pregnancy and lactation.

Nutritional therapy

Developmental orthopedic diseases secondary to
nutritional deficiencies are highly responsive to
nutritional intervention. Nutritional therapy
should be begun immediately and usually
involves feeding a commercial dog food. Commercial dog foods contain adequate amounts of calcium and phosphate and are well above the recommended allowance of vitamin D (i.e. 3.4 µg or
136 IU/ 1000 kcal -NRC 2006). In hypovitaminosis D, after 3 weeks of dietary therapy, mineralization of the growth plates should be almost normal
and there should be an improvement in mineralization of cortical and cancellous bone, as well as
callus formation around pathological fractures.
Mineralization will be complete after several more
weeks. If mineralization has not improved within

employed (Hazewinkel et al, 1987b). Corrective
surgery should be postponed until mineralization of the skeleton is complete.
In the acute phase of NSHP, therapy involves good nursing care and feeding a diet which fulfils
the dog’s nutritional requirements for its age and size without any injections of calcium or vitamin D. Commercial dog foods would be appropriate and contain adequate calcium content if chosen for correct age and size. The amount of calcium needed exceeds the amount which can be
safely injected by 1000 fold. The 1,25 OH2 vitamin D level is expected to be elevated and vitamin D injections would not be beneficial (Figure 18).
In the acute phase, affected bones cannot withstand the load of a splint or cast and will form another greenstick fracture just proximal to its margin. Compression of the vertebrae with compression of the spinal cord, especially in the lumbar area can occur and cause posterior paralysis in
severe cases.

INFLUENCE OF INCREASED VITAMIN D INTAKE IN PUPPIES

However, with high vitamin D3 intake, increased
hydroxylation occurs in the liver with conversion
into the 25(OH) vitamin D3 form. The high plasma
concentration of 25(OH) vitamin D3 stimulates both
the activity of 24-hydroxylase and 1alpha-hydroxylase. As a consequence more 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin
D3 will be synthesized but immediately further
hydroxylated

into 1,24,25(OH) tri-hydroxy-vitamin D3 and other
products of oxidation. This results in an increased
24,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 plasma concentration and a
decreased 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 plasma concentration (Tryfonidou et al, 2002). These changes do not
alter the absorption rate of is calcium or phosphate,
but it does cause severe abnormalities in cartilage
maturation, known as osteochondrosis, in Great
Danes less than 6 months of age. The latter is
probably the result of an imbalance between
24,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and the available 1,25(OH)2
vitamin D3 at the site of the growth plate
(Tryfonidou et al, 2003; Boyan et al, 2001).

Vitamin D intoxication due to vitamin D over
supplementation or cholecalciferol poisoning will
cause an increase in serum calcium levels by
reabsorption of calcium and increased osteoclastic
activity.
As a consequence of the increased serum calcium,
PTH levels will decrease. There will be an increased
threshold for phosphate in combination with
phosphate derived from osteoclasia. An increased
plasma phosphate level will also be seen with
vitamin D intoxication. Calcium phosphate will
precipitate in the stomach, lungs, and kidneys
with severe clinical consequences.

Therefore excessive vitamin D intake for a long
period should be avoided (Table 5), since it might
have deleterious effect on cartilage development
in young dogs. Some dog foods may have high
vitamin D levels, due to both the ingredients and
additional pre-mixture with a standard amount of
vitamin D and minerals (Kallfelz & Dzanis, 1989).

Under normal circumstances with a vitamin D3
intake of 500-1000 IU per kg food, the

10 times higher in small breed dogs than in large
breed dogs of the same age (70 µg/L vs. 7 µg/L),
due to excess growth hormone (GH) and insulinlike growth factor (IGF-I) in large breed dogs
(Hazewinkel & Tryfonidou, 2002). The 1,25(OH)
vitamin D3 plasma concentration in large
breed dogs is higher than in small breed dogs
(250 pmol/L vs 200 pmol/L) when raised on the
same food (Tryfonidou et al, 2002a), mainly due
to a lower activity of 24-hydroxylase in large breed
dogs.

5 - Osteoarthrosis

The long bones may be abnormally shaped and need surgical correction after mineralization is
completed, to allow for normal use. Although the prognosis should be guarded, posterior paralysis may disappear two weeks after installation of therapy. Abnormal alignment of the pelvic bones
may cause repetitive obstipation which will continue after restoration of the mineralization status of the skeleton. Fracture treatment or corrective osteotomies must be postponed till the skeleton is firmly mineralized.

5 - Osteoarthrosis
Osteoarthrosis (OA) is the largest problem in companion animal orthopedics since most if not all
joint diseases eventually result in OA and OA is the main cause of euthanasia in orthopedics.

Diagnosis
Clinical signs of OA can include decreased weight bearing of the affected leg, pain upon rising,
warming out during exercise (initial stiffness which improves with walking) and worsening of signs
after rest following heavy exercise. Physical examination may reveal palpably swollen and sometimes painful joints, crepitation and decreased range of motion depending on the chroTABLE 7 - PRIMARY CAUSES OF SECONDARY OSTEOARTHROSIS IN DOGS

The history and clinical findings of OA are so
typical, that localization of the diseased joint
may almost lead to the diagnosis; however
radiographs should be performed to rule out
other less likely causes. Joint effusion, osteophytes at the joint margins, and sclerosis of
subchondral bone are the main radiographic
findings; narrowing of the joint space and specific findings like a mineralized flap in case of
OCD, cranial displacement of the tibia in
case of cruciate ligament rupture (Figure 19)
and other findings may be noticed. In some

cases, additional diagnostics such as arthrocentesis, blood work, and other imaging modalities may
be necessary (Table 8).

Epidemiology
The age of occurrence of primary OA may depend on the breed, i.e. the mean age of dogs varies
by breed, ranging from 3.5 years in Rottweilers to 9.3 years in miniature Poodles (Patronek et al,
1997).

Gender in secondary OA may also be a risk factor for disease. Gender differences in OA are related to the primary cause. An example is fragmented coronoid process, seen in a 3:1 ratio of males
to females, and so too is the secondary OA. Another example is cranial cruciate ligament ruptures which are seen more frequently in castrated females than in any other gender (probably due
to obesity), and so too is the secondary OA of the stifle joint.

In these dogs a discrepancy in growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor concentrations were demonstrated in the plasma, similar to human
patients with OA (Hazewinkel et al, 1999). A previously unidentified
humoral factor harvested from arthritic joints has been identified that can
cause OA in vitro as well as in vivo (Wastacott et al, 1997; van Bilsen et al,
2002).

© Psaila

Overloading of the joint, either due to obesity or to over-use, is the main
cause for increased complaints in dogs with OA. Although the genotypical
factors can not be regulated by the owner of a specific dog, the phenotype
(i.e. suffering from OA) can partially be influenced. Increased food intake
(Hedhammar et al, 1974; Kasstrom, 1975; Lavelle, 1989; Kealy et al, 2000),
and increased calcium intake (Hazewinkel et al, 1985; Schoenmakers et al,
2000) may increase the frequency and severity of OA in individual dogs at
an older age.

Large breed dogs generally exhibit signs of osteoarthrosis
at an earlier age compared with small breed dogs.

373

Skeleton

It is plausible to imagine that the activity of the dog (like pulling a sled, running races, and jumping fences for police dog training) may advance degeneration of joint cartilage, even without
any primary cause including subluxation, shear and tear injuries, and avulsions or fatigue fractures.
Although not yet proven, there is reason to suggest that some breeds are more vulnerable for OA
than others. It is the author’s experience that Retrievers suffer more from OA than Rottweilers,
and some breeds suffer more from immune mediated OA (Shar-Pei, Boxer) than others.

5 - Osteoarthrosis

Pathophysiology
Osteoarthrosis (OA) is a vicious cycle. Cartilage damage (primary or secondary) will cause synovitis with the release of mediators of inflammation including interleukins (IL) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) which release metalloproteinases (MMPs) that cause further degeneration of cartilage (Figure 20). As a consequence, arachidonic acid will be metabolized into prostaglandins
and leukotrienes, causing a decrease in pain threshold, vasodilatation of the joint capsule, and
thus a swollen and warm joint.
These elements are characteristic for OA. The joint is not lubricated and the cartilage is not receiving enough nutrients with more cartilage damage as a consequence. This vicious cycle should be
broken by eliminating the cause, changing the breakdown pathways of arachidonic acid, decreasing the influence of inflammatory mediators and/or increasing the regenerative capacity of cartilage.

Due to cartilage damage, synovitis develops with the release of a variety of enzymes which further degenerate cartilage
and synovial cells. Destruction of the cell walls liberate arachidonic acid which may be enzymatically broken down into
leukotrienes or prostaglandins (see Figure 21), which cause the clinical signs of osteoarthrosis, i.e. painful, warm and
swollen joint. The joint is effusive with less mucin and more plasma transudate which, as a consequence, poorly
lubricate and nourish the cartilage, with more cartilage damage as a result.

During aging, the length of GAGs and proteoglycan content decrease, and thus so does the water
content and the flexibility of the cartilage to withstand loading (Figure 1). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), free radicals, trauma, infection and irradiation may also damage GAGs. Proteolytic
enzymes, including metalloproteinase (MMPs) and lysosomal enzymes may degenerate cartilage.
Regeneration can occur in cases of micro trauma, by proliferation of undamaged chondrocytes,
and de novo synthesis of proteoglycans and collagen. Severe cellular damage will lead to a scar
without cells; lesions of the tide mark cause inflammation and sclerosis of the subchondral bone,
and possibly the formation of a fibrotic cartilage scar with a low content of proteoglycans.

374

5 - Osteoarthrosis

Under normal circumstances MMPs will be suppressed by tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). However, in
cases of OA, MMPs will be formed by mast cells and synovial cells under the influence of the
cytokines, interleukin-I (IL-I) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), released by synovial cells,
monocytes, macrophages and T-cells. These cytokines stimulate chondrocytes and osteoclasts to produce MMPs as soon as their surrounding cartilage has been destroyed. In addition, IL-I stimulates
the release of arachidonic acid metabolites such as PGE2 and leukotriene B4 from chondrocytes
and synovial membrane.
The expression and activity of IL-I, TNF-α and cyclooxygenase (COX-2) can be reduced in presence of omega-3 fatty acids. Fish oil supplementation can specifically affect regulatory mechanisms involved in chondrocyte gene transcription (Curtis et al, 2000).

Treatment
Weight loss in overweight dogs and loss of any excess weight gained during times of
decreased mobility should be the primary goal. A significant improvement has been
recorded by Impellizeri et al (2000) in dogs with HD, following a decrease in body
weight by 11-18%. Weight reduction protocols are discussed in Chapter 1.
> Life style

© Psaila

The amount and kind of activity will need to be tailored to the degree of arthritis and
the joint involved. For example, a dog with a cruciate ligament rupture is best exercised by leash walks rather than zigzagging through the field and frequently rotating the
unstable joint. Swimming is a great activity for overweight dogs with arthrosis. Dogs
with HD should be prevented from jumping and climbing. The amount of activity
should be divided over several walks during the week rather than one large bout of
exercise once a week (i.e. during the weekends). If the dog becomes lamer after a period of rest following the exercise, the amount of activity will have to be reduced.

Swimming is a good activity for overweight dogs
with osteoarthrosis.

> Nutritional treatment

Dietary supplements are another aspect that can be incorporated in the management of OA
(Table 9). Chondroprotective agents protect cartilage from degeneration by enhancing the metabolism of chondrocytes and synoviocytes, inhibiting degradative enzymes and inflammatory
mediators and preventing thrombi formation in blood vessels (Beale, 2004; Bui & Taylor, 2000).
Some chondroprotective products are classified as nutraceuticals. The definition by the NAVNC
(North American Veterinary Nutraceutical Council) defines a nutraceutical as “a substance that is
produced in a purified or extracted form and administered orally to patients to provide agents
required for normal body structure and function and administered with the intent of improving
the health and well being of animals”. There are a variety of these dietary supplements (glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, polyunsaturated fatty acids, antioxidants and green lipped mussel products) that are used in the management of canine and human OA. However many of these products are lacking controlled clinical trials to show their efficacy in dogs.

Anti-inflammatory properties

Skeleton

In articular cartilage one of the predominant GAGs synthesized by chondrocytes is chondroitin
sulfate. Chondroitin sulphate increases in vitro the production of proteoglycans and as such the
regeneration of cartilage (Basleer et al, 1998). Chondroitin sulfate has also been shown to reduce
or inhibit the production of metalloproteinases. These enzymes are known to cause degradation
of the cartilage. When given to rabbits prophylactically, chondroitin sulfate has been shown to
prevent synthesis of MMPs by IL-3 and thus cartilage damage.
Chondroitin sulfate is partially digested before absorption yet it appears to be therapeutically effective after oral administration (Bui & Taylor, 2000).
Glucosamine is a precursor to GAGS and stimulates synthesis of GAGs, prostaglandins and collagen by chondrocytes in vitro (Bassler et al, 1992). Normal chondrocytes can synthesize glucosamine but it is the rate limiting step in the production of GAGs and proteoglycans (Bui & Taylor,
2000). As well chondrocytes in osteoarthritis may have decreased ability to synthesize glucosamine
(Beale, 2004). Thus exogenous administration of glucosamine may be beneficial in chondroprotection. Glucosamine administered orally is absorbed almost completely (87% of intake) and
rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (Setnikar et al, 1986; Bui & Taylor, 2000). Besides

376

5 - Osteoarthrosis

its chondroprotective effects, glucosamine has been shown to have mild anti-inflammatory effects
(Setnikar et al, 1991; Bui & Taylor, 2000).
There have been some clinical and in vitro trials to support its use in dogs and other species. Substitution of glucosamine in the medium of chondrocytes resulted in an increase in the mRNA
content for aggrecan, a decrease in MMPs, and an increased synthesis of proteoglycan (Reginster
et al, 2001).
In rabbits with a cranial cruciate ligament rupture, 120 mg/ kg body weight of prophylactic glucosamine decreased the amount of chondropathy in comparison with controls (Conrozier, 1998).
In a study using the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture as a model, Altman et al (1989)
demonstrated less cartilage swelling, less total and active metalloproteinase (MMP) and lower
pathologic scores in dogs injected with 4 mg/kg BW glucosaminoglycan polysulfuric acid
(GAGPS) twice weekly for 4-8 weeks, starting 4 weeks after the CCL rupture. It is suggested that
GAGPS suppressed proteoglycan breakdown by MMPs or by directly inhibiting MMP in cartilage,
rather than by increasing synthesis of proteoglycans by chondrocytes (Altman et al, 1989).
Another study demonstrated in a clinical double-blind, placebo controlled trial that 4.4 mg/kg
GAGPS (I.M. every 3-5 days) coincided with an improvement in lameness score, range of motion
and joint pain without side-effects in dogs with hip dysplasia after 8 injections, with only a small
improvement in the placebo group of dogs (De Haan et al, 1994).

FIGURE 22 - STRUCTURE OF A JOINT

Skeleton

Synovial liquid
Synovial membrane
Articular cartilage

The joint is protected by a capsule
covered on the inside by the synovial
membrane. This membrane secretes
the synovial fluid essential to the
nutrition of the cartilage. After oral
administration, glucosamine and
chondroitin are concentrated in
the synovial fluid.

The combination of chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine may be synergistic since each has a different mechanism of action (Bui & Taylor, 2000) (Figure 22). Hulse (1998) reported that a combination given to dogs with OA, subjectively allowed for more normal locomotion and joint
movement than untreated controls. As well this combination given prophylactically decreased
inflammation in dogs with induced arthritis (Canapp et al, 1999) possibly due to modulated
metabolism of the articular cartilage as was demonstrated in dogs with CCL ruptures (Johnson et
al, 2001).
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are often added in diets or given orally to help with the management of OA. Omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acid precursors are desaturated into arachidonic acid
(AA; 20:4n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:6n-3), respectively which compete for incorporation into cell membrane phospholipids. With cell damage, AA and EPA are released from
the cell membranes and broken down into prostaglandins and leukotrienes. AA forms the proinflammatory series 2 eicosanoids including prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4. EPA is converted

377

5 - Osteoarthrosis

to the anti-inflammatory or less inflammatory series 3 eicosanoids including prostaglandin E3 and
leukotriene B5. By altering the amounts of omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids in dietary intake, production of anti-inflammatory mediators is favored. Gamma linolenic acid (GLA) is an omega 6
dietary PUFA that converts into anti-inflammatory or less inflammatory mediators (Bui & Taylor, 2000).
In vitro, catabolic processes of articular cartilage chondrocytes treated with interleukin 1, are affected by supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids. Supplementation with omega-6 fatty acids does
not provide the same results (Curtis et al, 2002).
In joints with OA the LTB4 content is increased (Herlin et al, 1990). In dogs with experimentally induced synovitis, the clinical signs of synovitis, especially joint effusion, reduced when an inhibitor of the formation and the effects of LTB4 was given (Hansen et al, 1990). These studies
demonstrate the consequence of LTB4 in a joint affected by OA.
In 36 dogs with elbow OA due to ED a double blind efficacy study was performed by feeding increased omega 3 content (omega 3 of 4%, and omega 6 of 20%) or a high omega-6 content (omega
3 of 0.8%, and omega 6 of 38%) diet. Feeding the increased omega 3 content (omega 3 of 4%,
and omega 6 of 20%) diet caused a significant increase in plasma LTB5 concentrations, although
ground reaction forces did not differ between both groups of dogs (Hazewinkel et al, 1998).
Free radicals and toxic oxygen radicals are theorized to play a role in the pathogenesis of OA. Supplemental antioxidants may decrease the damage of synovial cells by radical oxygen scavengers.
In human studies there is some evidence to suggest that vitamin C, vitamin E, beta carotene, selenium, and zinc supplementation may be advantageous in reducing the risk of progression of arthritis and/or management of arthritis (Bui & Taylor, 2000). Manganese, silicon and pyridoxine play
a role in normal cartilage formation and supplementation may be beneficial with OA.

Green Lipped Mussel (Perna
canaliculi) from New Zealand.

378

New Zealand green lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus) contains anti-inflammatory components and
other nutrients that may promote joint health (Bui & Taylor, 2000; Bui & Bierer, 2001; Bierer &
Bui, 2002). The fatty acid content of the powder (i.e. separated from the shell) of the green-lipped mussel (GLM) is 34.6% saturated, 18.4% mono-unsaturated, and 47% poly-unsaturated. Of
the latter, 41% is omega 3 fatty acids (mainly eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA
and DHA), and a small amount of eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA, 0.3%), as well as 5.2% omega 6,
with a ratio of omega 6: omega 3 of 1: 10. ETA is a dual inhibitor of both the lipoxygenase and
cyclooxygenase pathways thus decreasing the
production of inflammatory mediators (Bui
&Taylor, 2000; Bui & Bierer, 2001; Bierer &
Bui, 2002). In addition GLM powder
contains chondroitin and glutamine (a glycosaminoglycan precursor), in a concentration of 6.9% and 0.0005% respectively. The
combination of omega 3 poly-unsaturated
fatty acids, the GAGs chondroitin and precursor glutamine, together with anti-oxidant
micronutrients (including zinc, copper, and
selenium) may have the synergistic potential
to limit the progression of OA.

Bierer and Bui (2002) reported their findings in a double blind, randomized, controlled trial in 17

dosage of 1000 mg when BW>34 kg; 750 mg when BW 34-25 kg; 450 mg when BW<25 kg) and
compared with 15 controls, all with OA. A subjective score of arthritic signs grading from no signs
to severe signs was given for mobility and for all major joints individually, before the start of the
study and at 6 weeks. Joint swelling, pain and crepitus were reported to improve in the GLMpowder supplemented group in comparison with the controls; the GLM-oil supplemented group
were only significantly different in joint pain and crepitus scores (Figure 23).
Skeleton

The highest anti-inflammatory activity in GLM was found in the poly-unsaturated free fatty acid
fraction of the powder, possibly the ETA by blocking both the COX as well as the lipoxygenase
pathway. No gastrotoxic effects or platelet aggregation have been found in in vivo studies with
GLM, therefore it is thought that the action is less directed to COX1 than to COX2. The GAGs
in GLM may help to regenerate cartilage or to decrease proteoglycan breakdown (Altman et al,
1989).

Frequently asked questions
Skeleton

Frequently asked questions:
nutrition and orthopedic diseases

Q

A

Is it better to feed an adult
maintenance diet to fast growing
puppies because of the lower
protein content?

No – high protein diets have not be implicated as the cause of osteoarticular disease during
growth in large breed puppies. Young fast growing dogs have a much higher requirement for protein for new tissue formation and development of their immune system than adult dogs. They
need the high quality and quantity of protein in their daily diet. By eating an adult maintenance diet, they will not meet their protein requirements. Signs of protein deficiency can be poor
body conformation and increased susceptibility to infections.

Is it ok to supplement with extra
minerals for the development of
strong bones?

No – supplementation of commercially available balanced dog foods should be prevented. Adding
minerals to the food will unbalance the diet and provide the dogs with excesses. Puppies less than 6
months of age are unable to protect themselves from an excess of calcium. During weaning at least
50% of the calcium is absorbed whatever the quantity ingested. This excess calcium intake will lead
to decreased skeletal modeling (enostosis, wobbler syndrome, possibly HD) and osteochondrosis
(OCD, radius curvus syndrome, elbow incongruity). During evolution dogs, living in a poor-calcium
environment, did not develop a system to defend themselves against excessive calcium intake.

Is it appropriate to advise owners
to add fat to their puppy’s diet if
the puppy is underweight?

By adding fat to the diet you will increase the caloric density. However, if the diet is already complete and balanced for a growing puppy by adding fat you are unbalancing the diet and may be creating nutritional deficiencies. Thus the puppy will now be consuming an unbalanced diet and over
time may exhibit signs of nutritional deficiency. Instead, advise the owner to change to a more palatable, more energy dense puppy food tailored for the requirements of that puppy’s life stage and size.

Since enostosis can be caused
by high calcium intake, should
I advise the owners of young
puppies to feed an adult food
instead?

No – adult dog food per energy content has a higher calcium content and generally a lower caloric
density than a puppy food. Puppies eat until they satisfy their energy requirements. Thus they need
to ingest more of an adult maintenance diet to meet their energy requirements and in the process
consume more calcium. Adult maintenance dog foods are not balanced in proteins and other
nutrients to meet a growing dog’s requirements. The best option is to recommend a diet tailored to
meet the nutritional requirements of fast growing dogs.

In my practice I have many dogs
from the same breeder with OCD
in their elbow joints. Should I
advise the owners to change diets?

What can I recommend to my
clients with young dogs which are
likely to develop hip dysplasia
besides preventative surgery?

380

OCD is a highly hereditary disease. The breeder should be counseled on selective breeding to
reduce the incidence of this genetic disease in their dogs. To decrease the occurrence of OCD in
animals at risk, feed an appropriate diet formulated for the dog’s lifestage and breed. When both
quality and quantity of the daily food is optimal, there is no reason to change diets.

Research has shown that diet has both quantitatively and qualitatively, a significant effect on the
development of HD. Owners of puppies at risk for HD should feed a high quality diet that has adequate energy and calcium for that breed and age; avoid energy and/or calcium and mineral excesses.
The amount of food consumed should be limited to meet the energy requirements of the puppy and
nothing more. In addition the training and activity schedules should be tailored to meet the vulnerability of young dogs’ skeletons. Surgery might be indicated in certain cases based on strict criteriajoint laxity and conformation - to prevent HD from developing into a clinical disease.

The growth phase of large-breed and giant-breed
puppies is an important period: the puppy multiplies
its birth weight eighty to a hundredfold in less than 2
years and most bone growth occurs in the first few
months.

Key Points
to remember:

Skeleton

Role of nutrition in osteoarticular diseases
• The daily weight gain is at a maximum between 3 and 5 months of
age in a large-breed puppy,
although it does continue to be
rapid until 8 months. It is advisable
to closely monitor the puppy’s
weight development, which must
not exceed 50% of estimated adult
weight at 5 months of age. If it does,
the ration will have to be reduced
and/or a less energy dense diet will
have to be chosen. There is a significant correlation between energy
overconsumption and a heightened
incidence of osteoarticular complaints.
• Before 6 months a puppy is unable
to protect itself from calcium excess:
it passively absorbs at least 50% of
the calcium ingested. The calcium
content in the food can be compared
on the basis of its energy density. The
quantity of calcium consumed per kg
of body weight is the only reliable
value. There is no ideal calcium
content for a given age, but there is
a safety zone: at 5 months the opti-

384

mal calcium content for a largebreed puppy is 210-540 mg/kg/day.
Excess calcium is a factor that promotes osteochondrosis.

• Green-lipped mussel extract (GLM)
exhibits interesting properties
within the framework of prevention
and treatment of arthrosis.

• Vitamin supplements should not
be prescribed when the puppy
consumes a complete food for growth.
An excess of vitamin D does not promote skeletal growth, but increases
bone resorption and leads to severe
cartilage maturation abnormalities
with a heightened risk of osteochondrosis.

It helps limit inflammation, preserve
the integrity of the cartilage and
combat oxidative lesions.

• Glucosamine and chondroitin
belong to the family of glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which are natural cartilage components. After oral administration these molecules concentrate in the synovial fluid. Their role
is to promote regeneration and to
curb enzymatic degradation of the
cartilage. Glucosamine and chondroitin participate in maintaining
the cartilage’s water absorption
capacity, an essential requirement to
fulfill its role in shock absorption.

The effects appear to be due to
synergy between the different components of GLM including GAGs,
omega 3 fatty acids, glutamine,
antioxidants and trace elements.
Several clinical studies show a reduction in pain and an improvement in
joint mobility in arthritic dogs during
administration of GLM.
Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
causes a decrease in degradative
aspects of chondrocyte metabolism,
which may have a beneficial effect in
degenerative joint diseases.

Focus on:

GREEN LIPPED MUSSEL
EXTRACT (GLM)

Canberra
Wellington

Origin and composition
The GLM powder used by Royal
Canin is an extract of Perna
Canaliculi or New Zealand green lipped mussel. It is obtained from the
mussel’s flesh in a procedure carried
out at low temperature (< 30°C) to
protect the quality of the components.
The Royal Melbourne Institute of
Technology
University
(RMIT
University) in Australia has been studying the lipidic fraction of Perna
Canaliculi for 15 years to isolate the
fatty acids. Eight to ten different sterols of marine origin are present, as
well as at least 10 different essential
fatty acids.
GLM is a concentrated source of
omega 3 fatty acids, which inhibit
some inflammatory mediators.
Omega 6 fatty acids account for
5.2% of the polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFA) and omega 3 fatty acids
41%. The omega 6/omega 3 ratio is
therefore 0.1. The two main PUFA of
the long-chain omega 3 series are

eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which
account for 35% of the PUFA.
The mussels harvested along the
New Zealand coast benefit from a
permanently renewed supply of
marine nutrients brought by ocean
currents. The mussels act as a seawater sieve, tending to retain essential
nutrients. That is why GLM contains
a large number of substances that
are potentially active in the fight
against arthritis:
• Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) (e.g.
chondroitin)
Natural components of cartilage and
synovial fluid that participate in the
lubrication of joints and preserve the
integrity of cartilage.
• Eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA)
Omega 3 fatty acid exclusively found
in GLM, which is able to inhibit the
cascade of metabolites with inflammatory properties derived from arachidonic acid.

COMPOSITION OF GLM POWDER:
Moisture

6.1%

Protein

40.7%

Fats

10.7 % including:
PUFA: 47%

Minerals

• Glutamine (amino acid)
Glutamine is a precursor of glucosamine (GAG)
• Antioxidants (vitamins E and C)
These vitamins play a role in combating oxidative stress caused by free
radicals.

Epidemiological Basis
The mussels of New Zealand were
traditionally an integral part of the
coastal Maori population’s basic diet.
It has been known for a long time
that there were more cases of
arthrosis among the island’s interior
population than among the coastal
population, which had been consuming fresh, raw mussels for generations.
In 1970 American researchers started
studying the question and the antiinflammatory properties of the mussel were soon revealed. It also became clear that the conditions under
which the mussel’s flesh was harvested and transformed were critical.
The lipidic fraction is highly sensitive
to oxidation, so extreme precautions
are necessary to preserve the therapeutic qualities.
The New Zealand green lipped mussel is now widely used throughout
the world.

16.1% including:
- Calcium: 0.98%
- Phosphorus: 0.62%
- Sodium: 3.5%

Multicentric trial
Royal Canin recently conducted a
study to validate, in field conditions,
the efficacy of a GLM-supplemented
diet in osteoarthritic dogs.
85 clinically-confirmed arthritic and
privately owned adult dogs, seen at
25 veterinary clinics, completed the
multicenter trial. All sizes of dog
were represented: 7 giant (>45kg),
46 large (26-45kg), 20 medium (11-

25kg) and 12 small (<10kg) breed
dogs. The dogs did not suffer from
any other disease and were not overweight.
Dogs were fed the GLM diet for 50
days. Evaluation of osteoarthritic
signs were carried out at day 0 (baseline) and at day 50 by veterinarians.
All parameters were scored from 0 to
3 (0: no sign; 1: slight ; 2: moderate;
3: severe). An initial score was given
for the dog’s general mobility during

walking, trotting and climbing steps.
Individual joints of each limb were
clinically scored for degree of pain,
swelling, crepitus and reduction in
range of movement. Summation of
the previous scores provided a Total
Arthritic Score (T.A.S.) for each dog.
Statistical comparisons between the
initial and final arthritic states were
made using a repeated-measure
ANOVA Test.

Oral Health

eriodontal disease is the most common disease of the oral
cavity in dogs. Every dog is affected during its life to some
degree. Curiously, compared with other diseases it’s often
neglected, although it can be treated or even prevented with care.
In oral hygiene, the benefit of any therapeutic intervention is of
short duration if it isn’t prolonged with daily care by the owner.
The aim of this care is to fight dental plaque. While brushing
is accepted as the most effective means of protection, there are
alternatives – both physical and chemical – to help control
plaque.

The incisors, which are much larger in the upper
jaw, are (from the middle of the denture):
frontal, central and corner incisors.

The first primitive mammals that appeared 250 million years ago during the Mesozoic era already possessed two hemi-mandibles connected ventrally by a symphysis and joined to the squamosal’s glenoid cavity by a condyle (temporomandibular articulation). The enamel-covered teeth
were divided into cutting incisors, rounded canines and grinding or hacking molars, implanted in
the alveolar borders of the maxilla and the mandible. Present-day mammals retain these essential
anatomical characteristics, with modifications depending on diet (Lavergne et al, 1996).

Jaws
In the carnivore specialization, temporomandibular articulation is located in the extension of the occlusal plane. It consists of a deep transversally-oriented, hemi-cylindrical
mandibular fossa, bordered ventrally by a powerful retro-articular process into which an
elongated mandibular condyle fits transversally. This mechanism principally permits the
raising and lowering of the mandible as well as the lateral movements in dogs that are
essential for ripping through prey (Lafond, 1929; Gaspard, 1967).

Occlusion of permanent teeth in dogs
Note the regular alternation of maxillary and
mandibular premolars: the main cuspid of
maxillary premolars is lodged in the middle of
the interdental space of the two mandibular
premolars. The mandibular canine is lodged in
the corner maxillary canine interdental space,
thus forming a powerful triad. In mesocephalic
and dolichocephalic dogs, and in certain brachycephalic dogs, the incisors have a scissor bite (the
cuspid of the mandibular incisors in contact with
the cingulum of the maxillary incisors).

389

Oral Health

The premolars have two roots, with the exception of the first premolar, which is regressive and has a crown formed by three cusps in a line. There is alternate occlusion of the
crowns of the maxillary and mandibular premolars with the necessity of diastema between the teeth.

© Ph. Hennet

The carnivores are diphyodonts (having two successive sets of teeth, deciduous and permanent) and heterodonts (having different types of teeth with different functions). The
incisors – prehensile cutters that number three per hemi-jaw – only have one root. The
conical canines are tearing teeth adapted to the diet of a carnivore.

1 - Anatomy and physiology

Physiology of manducation
The term manducation designates all the actions involved in eating, including prehension, mastication, insalivation and deglutition (Verchère et al, 1992). Contrary to humans, carnivores do
not chew their food. They divide them into scraps that are not completely crushed and scarcely
insalivated, but that are quickly swallowed. Manducation principally consists in breaking up large
pieces of food. In the wild, the canids capture their prey with their powerful canines. The incisors
serve to cut and tear large pieces, which are then introduced deeper into the oral cavity. This
action may be supplemented with jerks of the head driven by the muscles in the nape. The piece
of food – a muscle mass for instance – is cut by the scissors formed by the cuspids of the mandibular and maxillary carnassials (Figure 3). To enable this, the vestibular surface of the mandibular carnassials must come into contact with the lingual surface of the upper carnassials through an
opening of the symphysis and an external torsion of the mandibular body (Gaspard, 1967).

Mandibular biomechanics allow an alignment of the cuspids of the mandibular and
maxillary carnassials (I), to exercise a shear force (II) that breaks the food when
the mouth is closed (III).

I

II

Snagged by the cuspids of the carnassials, the food
is elongated by a lateral movement that results in
its breaking.

Oral Health

Only one mandibular branch works at any one time (Lafond, 1929). When the piece is soft and
less voluminous the canid can lock its jaws without bringing its carnassials together. This is also
what happens when it works simultaneously with the two hemi-mandibles. Here the piece breaks
due to an extension associated with shearing. The deformation is accompanied by lateral movements. Carnivores rip the elastic body and tear the fibrous tissues by laceration, which consists of
violently moving the mandibular teeth across the maxillary teeth. The food is violently stretched,
which results in it breaking at the point of least resistance (Figure 4).
When faced with a long, rigid body like a bone, the canid immobilizes it between its forepaws by
pressing one extremity against the ground and energetically seizing the other extremity in its
mouth. It then revolves its head from one side to the other to subject the body to flexion and torsion. The body ultimately breaks at the point of the carnassials. Thus, the body is squeezed then
crushed between the first upper molar and the crushing talon cusp of the lower carnassial. These
food fragmentation techniques and the major forces developed explain the powerful chewing
muscles that allow carnivores to lock their jaws.

2 - Periodontal disease
and oral hygiene
Unlike in humans, dental caries is very rare in dogs. A study of 435 dogs presented at a practice
specialized in veterinary dentistry reported that only 23 dogs (5.3%) presented with caries (Hale,
1998). The most common oral malady in dogs is periodontal disease, and most of this chapter is
devoted to it.
FIGURE 5 - PERIODONTAL

Periodontal disease

DISEASE

Periodontal disease is the result of a fight at tissue level (periodontium = gingiva, alveolar bone,
periodontal ligament and cementum) between bacteria that accumulate on the dental crowns
(bacterial dental plaque) and the individual’s defense system (Figure 5).
> Epidemiology

Periodontal disease affects every dog in the course of its life, although prevalence varies depending on the breed and the individual. The accumulation of bacterial dental plaque on the dental
crowns along the gingiva leads to an inflammatory reaction in this gingiva known as gingivitis.
Traditionally, the external surfaces (vestibular) of the teeth are more severely affected than the
internal surfaces (palatines or lingual), and the maxillary teeth are more affected than the mandibular teeth (Isogai et al, 1989; Rosenberg et al, 1966; Harvey et al, 1994) (Figure 6).

• Influence of the size of the dog

Periodontal
pocket

Small dogs (weighing less than 8 kg) suffer earlier and more severely, particularly on the incisors
and the internal surfaces of the teeth (Harvey et al, 1994). The smaller the dog, the greater the
volume of the teeth in the jaw. As a result, in the event of periodontitis, the gradual destruction
of the alveolar bone along the root may threaten the very solidity of the jaw. It has been shown
that the ratio [height of the mandible / height of the first molar] in dogs decreases significantly in
conjunction with the size of the dog (Gioso et al, 2001) (Figure 7).
The loss of a few millimeters of bone in a Yorkshire Terrier has greater consequences than it has
for a large dog. The jaw may become so fragile that fractures occur. In Yorkshire Terriers, oral disease
represents the primary reason for veterinarian consultation among all age groups (Veterinary
Medical Data Base, 1979-1999).

• Influence of the individual
The transition from gingivitis to periodontitis is a phenomenon specific to each individual. It
depends on limiting the development of infection through oral hygiene and/or the individual’s
local immune system.

• Influence of age

Oral Health

A study has shown that 80% of dogs older than six years of age presented with moderate to severe
periodontitis characterized by destruction of bone (Hamp et al, 1984). The supragingival dental
plaque is gradually mineralized into calculus by salivary secretions. The calculus may become
visible a few weeks after the dental plaque starts to accumulate. In a study of young Beagles, by
the age of 26 months, 95% of the dogs presented with a very large accumulation of calculus as
well as serious gingival inflammation accompanied by periodontitis (Rosenberg et al,
1966). Periodontal disease is naturally aggravated with age. There is a significant statistical correlation between age and the gingival index (intensity of the inflammation),
the calculus index (quantity of calculus), the tooth mobility index and the furcation
index (importance of the interradicular bone resorption) (Harvey et al, 1994).

392

Bacterial dental plaque is a natural bacterial film (biofilm) that develops on the surface
of the teeth (Overman, 2000) (Figure 8).
There are more than 350 recorded strains of bacteria in the oral cavity. Periodontal
disease is accordingly not caused by a single strain. These bacteria first accumulate in

FIGURE 8 - HEALTHY TOOTH AND GUM
Supragingival plaque
Bacteria
Bacteria-containing matrix

The bacteria that spread under the gingiva may also gradually provoke more deep-lying lesions (destruction of the
gingiva, periodontal ligament lesions, lesion of the alveolar
bone that supports the tooth). These deep lesions loosen the
tooth, which becomes more and more mobile. This characterizes the periodontitis phase. The normal attachment of
the periodontium to the tooth is destroyed and migrates to
the extremity of the root (= loss of attachment), resulting in
the creation of a periodontal pocket. The depth of this pocket depends on the concomitant rate of gingival recession.
Calculus is formed by the gradual mineralization of the dental plaque caused by mineral salts (especially calcium) provided by the saliva for supragingival plaque, or by the gingival fluid in which the gingival crevice is immersed, for subgingival plaque. Calculus is not responsible for periodontal
disease, but on a rough surface it is an ideal medium for bacterial dental plaque. In the event of chronic periodontal
disease the calculus is indivisible from the bacterial dental
plaque. It must be eliminated to enable the eradication of
plaque. Limiting the formation of calculus while curbing the
formation of bacterial dental plaque is one of the objectives
of oral hygiene.

2 – Periodontal disease

large numbers on the visible surface of the teeth (supragingival dental plaque), before spreading under the gingiva
(subgingival plaque). A milligram of dental plaque contains
around 10 million bacteria (Loesche, 1988). In contact with
the gingiva, these bacteria naturally provoke an inflammatory reaction, known as gingivitis.

The biofilm constituting the dental plaque is made up of numerous
bacteria inserted in a glycoprotein matrix that forms a kind of natural
glue. The bacteria communicate with each other by chemical signals
that trigger the production of proteins and potentially harmful enzymes.

Oral Health

Certain factors (reduced masticatory activity, dental malocclusion, persistence of deciduous teeth, absence of oral hygiene)
can advance the accumulation of dental plaque. Other
factors that affect the individual’s capacity to develop a normal defense reaction include: systemic diseases (diabetes mellitus, kidney failure, liver failure) and
innate or acquired immunodeficiency. The individual’s capacity to develop an appropriate defense
reaction is an innate factor. In general, the dog presents increased dental plaque and calculus accumulation and more serious gingivitis when it is nourished with soft, sticky food compared
with firm, fibrous food (Egelberg, 1965; Kaplan et al, 1978).
This apparent advantage in favor of firm, fibrous food applies only when the food is given
in the form of large pieces, which encourages the use of the teeth.

While not every individual that presents gingivitis automatically develops periodontitis,
gingivitis is the essential preliminary stage in the development of periodontitis. The very
principle of oral hygiene is therefore based on the control of supragingival dental plaque.
A study of Beagles suffering from light to moderate periodontitis has shown that professional periodontal treatment (scaling, subgingival debridement and polishing), followed by
daily brushing, helps reduce the initial loss of attachment and maintains this gain over a
three-year period. Additional periodontal treatment every six months over this period does
not improve the periodontal condition: neither does this same treatment every six months

in the absence of daily brushing which helps prevent the deepening of the pockets
and the loss of attachment (Morrison et al, 1979).
Oral hygiene can be split into primary hygiene (preventive measures on healthy
gingivae before periodontal disease develops) and secondary hygiene (prevention
of recurrence, after professional periodontal treatment of a pre-existing periodontal disease). In all cases, primary prevention is always desirable, because it occurs
earlier and thefore is more effective. The puppy must be educated from a very early
age. While oral hygiene applies to all dogs and all breeds, the main targets are
small and miniature dogs.

Tooth brushing is the gold standard in terms of controlling supragingival dental

In humans, an efficacy of the order of 70% inhibition of dental plaque can be asserted, at least for the most accessible vestibular surfaces (Mankodi et al, 1998; Van der
Weijden et al, 1998). Studies of Beagles have shown that brushing at least three times
a week helps maintain healthy gingivae, while brushing once a week does not
(Tromp et al, 1986a). In the presence of gingivitis, only daily brushing will re-establish healthy gingivae (Tromp et al, 1986b). The only clinical study published on
tooth brushing in dogs shows that, during a 13-month period, 49 of 51 owners
(96%) recall having received brushing instructions and 34 of 51 owners (67%)
recall having been shown how to brush teeth; 15 of 51 owners (2%) always brush
the dog’s teeth several times a week and 12 of 51 owners (24%) do so every day or
every second day (Miller & Harvey, 1994).
Aspect of the teeth of the same dog from the
right (A) and the left (B). At right all teeth are
presented and the deposits of dental plaque and
calculus are very low. At right, the maxillary
carnassial is absent, which means that there is no
mechanical effect with the mandibular carnassial,
resulting in major accumulation of dental plaque
and calculus.

While being a reference in oral hygiene, brushing is not an easy task for owners to
accomplish. Brushing can be complemented with the use of active chemical substances, of which chlorhexidine is still the most effective. In a study of Beagles in
which the dogs’ teeth and gums were massaged every day with a dental gel containing chlorhexidine and other ingredients, dental plaque on the vestibular surfaces
was reduced by 42-49% (Hennet, 2002). Whether these products are applied
through brushing or massage, they do necessitate the intervention of the owner and
the cooperation of the animal. These limitations have naturally led to the development of other
oral hygiene means that do not require the owner’s direct intervention. These indirect means comprise collagen-based chewing bones that can or cannot be eaten and specific dental foods.

Oral Health

3 - Role of food in oral hygiene
Influence of the food’s composition
When the composition of a food is changed but not its consistency, no significant influence is
observed on the development of periodontal disease. Protein deficiency does not appear to have
any consequence (Ruben et al, 1962). A protein-lipid (P-L) diet (50-50% in dry weight) or
the addition of carbohydrates (C) (60% C, 20% P, 20% L) does not lead to an aggravation of
periodontal disease (Carlsson & Egelberg, 1965; Egelberg, 1965). Osteopenia of alveolar bone
induced by secondary hyperparathyroidism with a nutritional cause (Ca/P = 0.1) does not appear
to influence the initiation and advancement of periodontal disease (Svanberg et al, 1973).
The active agents against dental plaque or calculus can be incorporated into a kibble or a chewing bar. They are then released in the oral environment during mastication. Anti-calculus agents
such as polyphosphates were studied first (Stookey et al, 1993). These are phosphate polymers
394

The chelation of salivary calcium is responsible for inhibiting the formation of calculus. To facilitate the release and the contact with salivary calcium, the polyphosphates must be incorporated
in the kibble coating (Stookey et al, 1993).

FIGURE 9 - MECHANISM OF
SALIVARY CALCIUM CHELATION
BY SODIUM POLYPHOSPHATE

Other compounds (polyphenols, essential oils, metallic ion salts, etc.) that have exhibited in vitro
or in vivo activity on the formation of dental plaque may also be incorporated. Studies are needed
to evaluate their activity in these conditions and to determine the best way of optimizing the release
of these substances in the oral cavity (in the external coating or in the kibble proper).

3 - Role of food in oral hygiene

(pyrophosphate, polyphosphate, hexametaphosphate), some of which present sequestering properties with bivalent cations like calcium (Figure 9).

Influence of the physical presentation
of the food
While it appears logical that a soft food or food in very small pieces would not help the function
of the teeth and manducation in canids, interest in the role played by the food is a relatively recent
phenomenon.
Studies conducted by physiologists have shown that gastrectomized dogs fed with a soft food developed more calculus (Ivy et al, 1931). In a study in which one group of dogs were fed with slices
of entire beef, the esophagus, the muscles and a mineral and vitamin supplement, and another
group was fed with the same food minced, the dogs in the second group presented with greater
accumulation of dental plaque than the dogs in the first group (Egelberg, 1965). Many other
studies have confirmed this (Krasse & Brill, 1960; Kaplan et al, 1978). In addition to the absence
of mechanical action, a soft food can provoke a reduction in the flow of saliva, a reduction in enzyme
secretions and functional atrophy (Sreebny, 1972).

The free calcium (Ca2+) in the
saliva is trapped by two sodium
polyphosphate molecules. It takes
the place of two sodium ions
(Na+) and is essential to the
formation of calculus.

It cannot simply be concluded however that a food in kibble form or a hard food is generally more
effective than a soft food. In Egelberg’s study (1965) the main factor is the fibrous character of the
food rather than its hardness. A multicenter study on 1350 dogs in North America has shown that
there is no significant difference between dogs fed exclusively with a dry food and other dogs. On
the other hand, dogs that have a number of objects to chew present less calculus, fewer cases of
gingivitis and less alveolysis than
those that have few or no objects to
chew (Harvey et al, 1996).

A dry food is potentially beneficial
for dental hygiene if the shape and

designed for a particular size or
breed of dog to contribute to passive tooth brushing mechanism. To
scrape the surface of the tooth when
the dog eats, the dog must chew so
that the tooth penetrates the kibble
deeply before the kibble breaks. Size
and breed are two parameters that
influence the pressure exercised on
the kibble at the moment of prehension. Devices have been studied to
test the kibble penetration threshold
before fragmentation. This enables a
comparison between various kibbles
(Figure 10).

enables the tooth to penetrate much deeper and
so produces a more

Control of dental hygiene with food
The possibility of controlling dental plaque and
the development of periodontal disease by the
mechanical action of a chewing bone or specific
foods was picked up on in the pet food industry in
the early 1990s. Various studies were conducted on
dogs with respect to dental plaque, calculus, coloration and gingivitis. Only dental plaque and gingivitis presented a medical interest. Dental coloration, important in humans for aesthetic reasons, is
not of interest in dogs.

Royal Canin laboratory texturometer.
The texturometer is used to measure the resistance
of the kibble to the force of the dog’s jaws and
teeth. Interchangeable modules mimic the shape
and the dimensions of the teeth of dogs
of various ages and sizes.

A significant 19% reduction in dental plaque compared with the control group was obtained after one week of feeding with a kibble specifically targeting oral hygiene (Jensen et al, 1995). More recently, significant reductions of 39% in dental
plaque and 36% in gingival inflammation were obtained after six months with the same food
among dogs weighing 9-25 kg (Logan et al, 2002). In another study on the preventive effect of a
daily food bone in dogs weighing an average of 23 kg, a significant reduction of dental plaque at
12 and 21 months (but not at 18 months) and gingivitis at 12, 18 and 21 months was observed
(Gorrel & Bierer, 1999). Unfortunately, the reduction percentages are not given in this study, but
an extrapolation based on the graphs show a maximum reduction of dental plaque and gingivitis
of 15-20%.
The improvement of oral hygiene by food or dietary complement is accordingly a blossoming field.
Besides the action on calculus, dental plaque and gingival inflammation must also be targeted.
While the above results are very interesting, they have been obtained on medium-sized dogs,
which is not at all the group most seriously affected by periodontal disease. Dogs weighing less
than 8 kg are most seriously affected by periodontal disease. Studies must be conducted on specific breeds (Yorkshire Terrier, Poodle, Dachshund, etc) to verify whether the same results can be
obtained. The author has conducted a study on 18 small dogs [average 7 kg] belonging to one of
two groups depending on their genetic relationship. The test group that was given a dental chewing bar presented significant statistical reductions of 17% in dental plaque and 45% in calculus
at the end of four months of study (Hennet, 2004).

Actual size: 9 cm

The methodology of these studies has been questioned, mainly with respect to the evaluation of the dental plaque (Hennet, 1999; Harvey 2002). An improvement in the methodology could be considered to achieve results that are not only statistically significant but
more importantly, biologically significant.

Oral Health

Conclusion

Example of a dental bar for small
dogs that helps limit the accumulation
of dental plaque and calculus.
It is recommended that this type of complement
be first given after scaling. The resistant
yet elastic texture of this type of
bar requires the dog
to use its teeth to chew
before swallowing.

396

There are various ways of controlling the formation of dental plaque and calculus through manducation, all of which have been studied a great deal. Product shape, texture and appetence have
received most attention, as has the possibility of incorporating chemical agents that act on the
dental plaque, the calculus or the inflammatory reaction. These innovations have undoubtedly
advanced the efforts to prevent periodontal disease.
We’re witnessing a new era in veterinary nutrition. After mastering the food at the dietary
level, the specific characteristics of the species and the various breeds must be given due consideration. Besides offering a good nutritional balance, the food can also play a role in preventing medical problems. Food with added value in oral hygiene and chewing bars that encourage mastication and have a texture that maximizes the self-cleaning effect contribute to reducing the accumulation of dental deposits and perhaps to preventing gingivitis. While daily
brushing remains the best way of preventing periodontal disease, the complementary use of
dental foods is recommended.

Food is a useful tool for the prevention of
periodontal disease, as it helps to slow down the
development of dental plaque and calculus. The
most efficient approach combines a mechanical
effect coupled with active ingredients.

Key Points

Ingredients that play a role in the prevention
of periodontal disease
Kibbles with a dental function
have a special form and texture
that obliges the dog to chew to

oral cavity during mastication.
Upon release, the active agents are
incorporated with saliva. Until
now, the objective of various solutions has been to limit bacterial
proliferation through substances
that have a bacteriostatic or even
bactericidal effect. The inconvenience of these products is that

they disrupt the natural floral
equilibrium, because the bacterial
action targets all bacteria, even
beneficial strains.
New lines of research are focusing
on molecules that limit the adhesion of bacteria to the surface of
the teeth.

Frequently asked questions about kibbles
with a dental function

Q

A

Should kibbles with a dental function
be prescribed to a dog that already
has calculus?

Prior dental care is essential because a dog that suffers from periodontitis may feel discomfort or pain
when eating and refuse to eat the kibbles. The prescription of a specific food with a dental function
delays calculus accumulation but it does not remove it.

Which is preferable, a chewing bar or
kibbles with a dental function?

Selection is based on the age (kibbles with a dental function are for adult dogs) and the size of
the dog, as well as the motivation and the budget of the owner. The ideal solution for dogs is a
combination of the two.

Do kibbles with a dental function contain
any ingredients against plaque?

No, but they can contain nutrients that significantly curb the development of dental plaque.

1 • Evaluation of the Logan & Boyce plaque index for a study
on the accumulation of dental plaque in the dog
Many index systems have been
developed to evaluate the accumulation of plaque on the dental
surfaces. The Silness & Loë index
(1964) focuses on the thickness of
the plaque that accumulates on
the tooth along the gingival line,
while most methods evaluate the
spread of the plaque on the dental
surface after the action of a colorant; e.g. Quigley & Hein (1962),
Turesky et al (1970).
• A modification of the Turesky
index was introduced into veterinary dentistry by Logan & Boyce
(1994). This index has since been
used in several studies evaluating
the influence of chewing toys,
bones or specific foods on the formation of dental plaque (Gorrel,
1999; Logan et al, 2002). Since this new
evaluation method differs significantly from the original Turesky

index, the name Logan & Boyce
index has been proposed (Hennet,
1999). In the original description of
this index, a horizontal division of
the surface of the crown in two
parts (coronary and gingival) was
proposed, without this being precisely described (Logan & Boyce,
1994). Other systems used in
human dentistry, like the Navy
plaque index, use a horizontal division of the surface of the crown,
based on anatomical criteria
(Fischman, 1986, 1988). In contrast to
the Turesky method, the Logan &
Boyce index evaluates the surface
and the thickness of the plaque on
every half of the dental crown. The
intensity of coloration (light,
medium or intense) is used to evaluate the thickness of the plaque.
The Logan & Boyce index has been
validated for use in veterinary dentistry (Gorrel, 1999). But to our

knowledge, no study has been
published to document the reliability of this index in dogs (intraobserver repeatability and interobserver reproducibility).
• The aim of this study was to follow the repeatability of the scores
provided by an experienced observer (intra-observer repeatability)
and to compare the scores provided by an experienced or inexperienced observer (inter-observer
reproducibility), utilizing the
Logan & Boyce index. The authors
were also interested in the influence of a modified Logan & Boyce
index, in which the anatomical
points are used for a horizontal
division of the tooth, and an intensity gradient was used to evaluate
the intensity of coloration, so as to
improve the repeatability of the
measures.

3 • Significance of specific phosphates for oral health

The various types of
phosphate
Phosphates constitute a very large
family of more than 150 different
molecules (including orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, polyphosphate and metaphosphate). Some
phosphates present sequestering
properties with bivalent cations
such as calcium (e.g. Ca2+). These
properties depend on the length
of the phosphate chain (the longer
the chain, the greater their capacity to chelate bivalent cations) and
on the local pH. These types of
compounds are used in many
human toothpastes (Sowinski et al,
1998).

Phosphates:
type of action
The Ca2+ cations in saliva have a
direct role in the calcification of
dental plaque (calculus deposition).
The phosphates which are able to
chelate polyvalent cations will be
able to capture the Ca++ cations in
the saliva. If polyphosphates are
released in the oral cavity they will

naturally chelate the salivary calcium in ionic form, thus limiting its
integration in the dental calculus
matrix. Calcium is then released as
normal in the digestive tract and
absorbed by the organism in accordance with its needs.

used, even when the dose is identical. Compared with a control
group, the reduction in the calculus deposit after a month among

Zinc salts have potential beneficial
effects in the area of oral health.
They can act as oral antiseptics that
tend to limit bacterial proliferation

zinc sulfate, ZnSO42 -).

med in humans (Sowinski et al, 2001;
Barrea et al, 2001).
Inhibition of the production of
sulfonated volatile fatty acids

In vitro the zinc salts help control
the production of foul-smelling
molecules responsible for halitosis
(Weesner, 2003).
A study of humans has also shown
that zinc salts inhibit the production of foul-smelling volatile fatty
acids from 14C-glucose (Harrap et al,
1984).

Scientific studies
Actinomyces

Oral Health

More than 300 strains of bacteria are
present in the oral cavity. Streptococci
and Actinomyces, which have
adherence properties, are the first to
colonize the dental biofilm. The
primary supragingival plaque will
reach the sub-gingival area, where the
development of an anaerobic flora is
favored. This transition from a
commensal flora to a pathogenic
bacterial population is responsible
for the development of periodontal
disease.

Inhibition of calculus
formation

In vitro the zinc salts can help limit
the deposit of dental calculus by
inhibiting the formation of calcium hydroxyapatite complex, and
by promoting the formation of
more soluble calcareous complexes
like tricalcium phosphate.

Inhibition
of bacterial growth

The zinc salts present bacteriostatic
properties that have been demonstrated in vitro, especially a high
anti-microbial activity against
Streptococcus mutans (Belcastro et al,
1994).

A study conducted on rats has
shown that animals whose teeth
are brushed with a toothpaste formulated with zinc salts present
significantly less calculus deposit
than the control group (Putt et al,
2002). This finding has been confir-

This anti-microbial activity has
been confirmed in cats. A significant reduction in plaque deposition and the burden of anaerobic
pathogenic bacteria involved in
periodontal disease have been
observed in a group of cats treated
with a gel containing zinc salts

5 • Significance of specific polyphenols for oral health
Some polyphenol sources can be
incorporated into the food to limit
the formation of dental biofilm.
Green tea, which is rich in active
polyphenols (e.g. epigallocatechin
gallate or EGCg), is considered to be
beneficial in the prevention of periodontal disease.

The various types of
polyphenols
More than 8000 types of polyphenol have been identified. Some
have a highly complex chemical
structure. This decidedly varied
group comprises molecules containing a simple phenolic nucleus and
highly polymerized compounds
(tannins). Naturally present in all
living beings, polyphenols play an
essential antioxidant role.

Polyphenols: type
of action
The bacteriostatic action of certain
polyphenols is allied to their
antioxidant properties, especially

to the presence of the hydroxyl
group (OH-) in ortho configuration, as well as the presence of the
gallate function on the phenolic
ring.

Scientific studies

Among the polyphenols present in
green tea, epigallocatechin gallate
(EGCg) has the strongest bactericidal activity. Its minimal inhibition
concentration is between 250 and
500 µg/mL depending on the
various strains of Porphyromonas
gingivalis (Sakanaka et al, 1996).

Inhibition of the growth of bacteria
in dental plaque

• In vivo

In dogs, the flora of the periodontal pockets is marked by the presence of specific bacteria, such as
Porphyromonas endodontalis, gingivalis and circumdentaria (Isogai et
al, 1999).

In dogs, a diet formulated with
green tea, which is naturally rich in
catechins, has helped inhibit the
growth of bacteria and after two
months, to significantly reduce the
Porphyromonas percentage in the
microbial population of dental
plaque (Isogai et al; 1995, 1992).

• In vitro

Certain phenolic compounds
(particularly those of the catechin
family) present an anti-bacterial
effect against the bacteria in the
dental
plaque,
such
as
Porphyromonas gingivalis and
Prevotella spp. (Hirasawa et al, 2002),
Escherichia coli, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans
(Rasheed et al, 1998).

Inhibition of the capacity of
bacteria to adhere to the epithelial
cells in the mouth
In vitro, the polyphenols contain a

gallate function (epigallocatechin
gallate or EGCg; gallocatechin gallate or GCg; catechin gallate or
Cg), which reduces the capacity of
Porphyromonas gingivalis to adhere
to the surface of epithelial cells
(Sakanaka et al, 1996).

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

On average, every epithelial cell
can capture 300 P. gingivalis. At
250 µg/mL of pure polyphenols
(which possess a gallate function),
the inhibition of the adherence is
almost complete, but at 7.8 µg/mL
the number of P. gingivalis adhering is reduced by 30% (Sakanaka et
al, 1996). According to these
authors the anti-adhesion capacities of polyphenols will be targeted on the bacteria rather than the
epithelial cells.
The adhesion of other bacteria is
also limited by polyphenols which
possess a gallate function.

At concentrations between 125
and 250 µg/mL the adhesion of
Porphyromonas melaninogenicus
and Streptococcus sanguis is reduced by 50%. Streptococcus sanguis
is one of the first bacteria that
leads to the formation of plaque
(Sakanaka et al, 1996).
Inhibition of the production
of acid metabolites by the bacteria
of dental plaque

some polyphenols are capable of
inhibiting the production of these
acid metabolites generated by the
bacteria of the plaque (e.g.
Porphyromonas gingivalis). This
inhibitor effect is due to the presence of the gallate function of
certain phenolic compounds, especially EGCg, GCg, and Cg, which
are present in green tea (Sakanaka et
al, 2004).

The bacteria of the plaque (such as
Porphyromonas gingivalis) generate
acids: n-butyric acid, phenylacetic
acid or propionic acid. In vitro,

Inhibition of bad breath

Some oils, notably eucalyptus or

breath (halitosis). The significance
of eucalyptus oil is due to the fact
that it not only masks bad smells,
but actively participates in reducing the production of sulfonated
volatile fatty acids.

molecules that cause inflammation
(prostaglandins E2 and B4), and
cytokines in human monocytes.
This mechanism is promissing for
limiting the development of nascent gingivitis (Juergens et al, 2003).
Inhibition of bacterial activity

Eucalyptus oil inhibits the growth
of certain bacteria involved in periodontal disease such as Porphyromonas
gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum,
Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus
sobrinus. These periodontogenic
bacteria are destroyed by 30minutes of exposure to a solution

Brushing the teeth with toothpaste adapted for dogs remains

Cancer/Cachexia

utrition is not often thought of as a critical issue in cancer
management, but can be an important variable that
effects quality of life and survival times. In patients
with cancer, particularly metastatic disease, it is not a question
of curing the patient, but a question of how can the quality
of life for the patient be increased. Over the past 20 years
there has been a growing literature base concerning the role of
certain macronutrients (fats, protein, and carbohydrate) and
micronutrients, (vitamins, minerals, fatty acids and amino acids)
on neoplastic diseases. Though this area of investigation is still
in its infancy, there is increasing evidence that nutritional
management of neoplasia can have profound effects on the lives
of the animals and owners that are involved in this disease
process.

1 - Nutritional assessment of the cancer patient

1 - Nutritional assessment
of the cancer patient
Though not the focus of this chapter, a patient that presents with anorexia requires
immediate attention including administration of enteral, or possibly partial or total
parental nutrition (see chapter 14). It is often difficult to determine whether weight
loss is due to anorexia, or cancer cachexia. Often in advanced neoplastic diseases there
is an element of intermittent anorexia associated with chemotherapeutic treatment of
the disease itself.

WHEN CANCER IS DIAGNOSED IN A
DOG, THE VETERINARIAN GENERALLY
ENCOUNTERS ONE OF THREE SITUATIONS:

1) Neoplasia without nutritional complications
2) Neoplasia with anorexia
3) Neoplasia with cachexia

Clinically, cachexia can be defined as progressive weight loss in the face of apparent
adequate caloric intake. This situation may be caused by a variety of mechanisms, but
is most commonly thought of as an alteration in the basal metabolic rate resulting in
an increased resting energy requirement. However, other factors which are not due to
an increase in the metabolic rate may also result in lean body wasting.

A veterinary study suggested that a significant sub-population (27%) of feline cancer
patients will develop cachexia (Baez et al, 2002). The percentage of canine cancer
patients with cachexia has not yet been determined, but as treatment modalities
extend the survival times of canine cancer patients, cachexia may become more prevalent.

Obtaining a good history, a thorough physical examination, personal assessment and
patient follow-up is critical in determining the metabolic status of the animal. To differentiate whether a cancer patient is hypermetabolic or if there are other mechanisms
causing lean body wasting requires not only assessment of body weight, but also determining body condition score and attempting to subjectively determine whether there
has been abnormal lean body wasting in the patient.
In general, anorexia will result in weight loss
primarily of adipose tissue, while patients with
cachexia will lose nearly equal amounts of skeletal
muscle and fat mass.

Sophisticated tools including Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) and bioelectrical impedence can be used to assess lean body mass, however, these modalities are not available to most
clinicians. Therefore regular measurement of body weight and body scoring are essential when
monitoring neoplasia.
When assessing the cancer patient for excessive weight loss and lean body wasting, other diseases
that must be ruled out include diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, renal disease, and hyperthyroidism, since biochemical and hormonal stimulation of weight loss and cachexia may also occur in
these diseases as well.

2 - The role of nutrition in cancer and cachexia

Close scrutiny of scapular, hindlimb, and masticatory musculature is routinely necessary is
cachexia is suspected (Baez et al, 2002). Bony prominences such as the glenoid tuberosity, the spine
of the scapula, the tuber ischii, greater trochanter of the femur and the sagittal crest of the skull
become more evident in a short period of time.
Examination of the gluteal musculature and paralumbar muscles which lead to prominence of the
ileal crest and vertebral spines are also easily useful for assessing lean body wasting (Figure 1).
Similar to body condition scoring (BCS) for obesity, there is a muscle condition scoring (MCS)
system in development. This tool should be available for clinicians in the near future to help define cachexia and abnormal lean body wasting in dogs.

In some cases the demise of the patient with neoplasia is not due to the neoplasia itself, but to the
overwhelming loss of body condition. Understanding these processes is important for appropriate nutritional intervention.

Nutritional epidemiology of cancer in veterinary
medicine

Cancer/Cachexia

The role of nutrition in cancer prevention has become the subject of tremendous research in
human medicine because of the variability in the human diet, and the awareness that certain dietary regimens may decrease the relative risk of neoplasia. This may also be true for companion
animals, although most veterinary patients are receiving a more balanced diet than most humans.
There have been three epidemiologic studies in dogs examining dietary and body conformation
risk factors for mammary neoplasia. The results of these studies reported that the fat content of
the diet had no significant relationship to the incidence of neoplasia, yet obesity did increase the
relative risk of mammary carcinoma (Sonnenshein et al, 1991).
Interestingly, one study showed that as the protein concentration of the diet increased, the relative risk of mammary neoplasia decreased, while a second study reported an increased relative risk
of neoplasia in bitches fed raw meat as the primary source of caloric intake (Shofer et al, 1989; PerezAlenza et al, 1998). When interpreting the results from these studies, it can be deduced that as the

protein concentration in the dog food increases, the quality of the food is often better. Conversely, raw meat based diets are usually nutritionally unbalanced. Therefore,
as the overall nutrient balance of the feed decreases, the incidence of neoplasia may
increase. Hence, in veterinary patients it may be ideal to feed well balanced diets that
comply with nutritional (National Research Council, NRC) guidelines for feeding
dogs, when attempting to decrease the prevalence of certain neoplasias.

Many approaches have been taken over the past

In general, neoplastic cells have higher rate of anaerobic energy metabolism than nor40 years to influence neoplastic growth through

colytic pathway. This up-regulation of glycolysis leads to an accumulation of pyruvate
which is rapidly converted to lactate, thereby resulting in a mild lactic acidosis, which
has been documented in canine cancer patients (Vail et al, 1990; Olgivie et al, 1997). Once lactate
has been liberated from the neoplastic cell into the bloodstream it will be taken up by the liver,
converted back into glucose, and may return to the neoplastic cell to undergo glycolysis, similar
to the Cori Cycle (Olgivie & Vail, 1990; Howard & Senior, 1999) (Figure 2). During this process of
converting glucose into lactate there has been a gain of 2 ATP from glycolysis in the cancer cell,
yet the conversion of lactate back into glucose in the hepatic cell requires 4 ATP and 2 GTP yielding a net loss of 2 ATP.

Cancer/Cachexia

Additionally, it has been shown that the humoral release of certain cytokines from inflammatory
tissue around the neoplasia or from the neoplasia itself leads to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, which may result in reduced ATP production (Giordano et al, 2003).
Certain cytokines may also down-regulate endothelial lipoprotein lipase activity causing fatty acid
and triglyceride accumulation in the bloodstream and prevent the storage of fatty acids within
adipocytes. Together these changes may result in alterations in serum lipid profiles and hypertriglyderidemia which have been observed in dogs with lymphoma (Olgivie et al, 1994).
To supply adequate energy for the futile cycling of various systems, and in an attempt to alter the
dependency of neoplastic processes on anaerobic glycolysis, alterations in dietary levels of the
energy providing substrates (protein, fat and carbohydrate) are often made in an attempt to slow
progression of disease and thus increase survival time (Argiules et al, 2003).

A major risk factor for cancer cachexia is
the increase in energy requirements due
to activation of proteolytic systems.

411

2 - The role of nutrition in cancer and cachexia

Cancer cachexia
For many years it was thought that all patients with cancer cachexia had elevated resting metabolic rates due to the increased metabolism in cancerous tissue. However, many studies in human,
and now veterinary medicine have shown that the resting metabolic rate after removal of tumors
does not change. Furthermore, the resting metabolic rate can be extremely variable, and is often
not correlated with the cachectic syndrome (Vail et al, 1990; Olgivie et al, 1997; Argiules et al, 2003).
Until recently it was thought that excessive lean body wasting was due to increased degradation
of amino acids to support cancer growth, and without adequate intake the body would catabolize
skeletal muscle to meet these demands.
Over the past ten years the role of various proteolytic systems (capthesins, calpains and ubiquitin/proteasome) involved in skeletal muscle atrophy associated with cancer cachexia have been
studied. The ubiquitin/proteasome system has recently received a lot of attention as this system is
up-regulated in cancer cachexia and other diseases associated with lean body wasting (Baracos,
2000; Inui, 2002; Argiules et al, 2003). This is a complex system that marks a protein for degradation and then shuffles the tagged protein through a large multi-subunit protease called the proteasome. The process requires ATP, and may play a role in increasing the ATP consumption observed in neoplasia.
Though speculative, it is thought that the amino acids liberated from this process may be either
used for energy production or lost in the urine. Many factors (i.e cytokines) have been implicated in the up-regulation of this system in cancer cachexia. Many of these factors are secreted into
the blood stream by the primary or metastatic neoplastic tissue. Some of the more important factors include Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and a
newly identified factor called Proteolysis Inducing Factor (PIF). PIF may be the most important
factor involved in cancer cachexia (Argiules et al, 2003; Baracos, 2000) (Figure 3).

3 - Nutritional considerations for cancer and cachexia

3 - Nutritional considerations
for cancer and cachexia
Energy sources
Carbohydrate is often the most abundant energy source found in companion animal diets, particularly dry type canine diets. Since neoplastic tissue thrives on glucose as its primary energy substrate, the strategy is to force the neoplasia to use other substrates which may help in decreasing
cell proliferation. During cachexia it may be important to provide extra dietary protein to help
attenuate the cachectic process. Therefore, choosing a diet high in fat and protein with low carbohydrate may be helpful. Many premium dry and canned products, in particular specialty foods
for active or stressed canines, may be used. Most of these products contain higher quality and
quantities of protein and fat as compared to adult maintenance diets.
When changing commercial food, the guaranteed analysis for protein and fat content must be
examined. Good guidelines are at least 35% protein and at least 25% fat on a dry matter basis for
dogs. The guaranteed analysis can be used to estimate what percentage of protein, fat and carbohydrate are in the chosen food but it should be converted to a dry matter basis (Table 3). Canned
foods are often around 70-75% water, therefore the “as fed” percentages of protein and fat listed
in the guaranteed analysis are much lower than in dry foods, but when examined for protein, fat
and caloric content based on dry matter, they can actually be better than extruded products.
Contraindications for feeding such a diet include dogs and cats with congenital or acquired hypertriglyceridemia, a history of pancreatitis, or chronic renal disease.

Amino acids and fatty acids
It has been well documented that dietary amino acid alterations may be beneficial as an intervention to retard tumor growth in animal models (Mills et al, 1998; Epner et al, 2002). Further developments in this area will likely lead to a better understanding of how manipulating amino acid
metabolism can retard tumor progression and aid in quality of life and survival time of the patient
with neoplasia.

FIGURE 4 - THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF ARGININE
IN CANCER

Supplemental L-Arginine

Increased dietary arginine has been shown to slow tumor progression
in a number of animal models (Burns et al, 1984; Milner et al, 1979; Robinson et al, 1999). This effect may be either due to the ability of arginine
to form nitric oxide through NO synthase activity in neoplastic cells
leading to retarded cell division, and/or its ability to increase cellular
immune surveillance properties (Reynolds et al, 1990; Robinson et al,
1999). The exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, but providing up
to 2% of dietary proteins as arginine may be beneficial to the canine
cancer patient (Olgivie et al, 2000) (Figure 4).

Glutamine may also have suppressive effects on tumorigenesis. Glutamine appears to have a profound immuno-stimulatory role, which leads

rapidly transaminated by the liver, therefore its efficacy in pet foods for
long term clinical cases of neoplasia is uncertain (Bergana et al, 2000).
Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAA - isoleucine, leucine, valine) are
increasingly used as a supplement in critically ill patients due to the potential benefits cited in
human literature. The use of BCAA’s as anti-tumorigenic amino acids has been debated (Danner
& Priest, 1983; Blomgren et al, 1986; Saito et al, 2001), but it is likely that dietary supplementation
with certain BCAA’s (leucine) may be beneficial in conjunction with other amino acids like arginine in retarding tumor growth (Wakshlag et al, 2004).

Increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids has shown strong correlation with remission and survival
times, and decreased growth rate of carcinomas in animal models (Thomson et al, 1996; Olgivie et al,
2000; Togni et al, 2003). In addition, human clinical studies have shown positive effects of omega3 fatty acids supplementation on body weight, quality of life, disease free intervals and survival times
in cancer cachexia patients. These changes may also be true for canine cancer patients (Olgivie et
al, 2000; Wigmore et al, 2000; Barber et al, 2001; Fearon et al, 2003) (Figure 6).

EPA slows tumor growth by decreasing the production of
promitogenic agents from arachidonic acid.

Cancer/Cachexia

EPA and DHA can have a profound negative effect on cachexia. Furthermore, they may also attenuate tumor growth through their ability to decrease arachidonic acid metabolism by preventing the
promitogenic production of PGE2 in neoplastic cells (Yuri et al, 2003) (Figure 7). Fish oils (eg. Menhaden oil) are the richest source of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA (Table 4) and have been
shown to be useful in ameliorating cachexia in human clinical trials (Wigmore et al, 2000; Fearon et al,
2003). Some “premium” dog foods are supplemented with omega 3 fatty acids to achieve a 10:1-5:1
ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids. The addition of fish oil can significantly alter the omega 6 to
3 ratio beyond what is already found in most pet foods (Olgivie et al, 2000). Though not detrimental
to most patients, ratios lower than 1:1 have been associated with increased clotting times and decreased vitamin E concentrations within cellular membranes (Valk et al, 2000; Hendriks et al, 2002).
Only one canine clinical study has been performed with the use of fish oil at a ratio of 0.3:1 and
the results showed increased survival times and disease free intervals in dogs with lymphoma, with
no discernable side effects (Olgivie et al, 2000). The clinical evaluation of fish oil supplementation
in multiple other neoplastic conditions is presently underway and unpublished data suggest that
fish oil may be promising for the management of several neoplastic conditions.

Vitamins and minerals

Supplemental feeding of common dietary antioxidants such as β-carotene, retinoids and vitamins
C and E have all been associated with decreased risk of carcinogenesis in animal models and in
epidemiological cohort studies. Selenium is the only mineral with similar anti-carcinogenic
effects. The standing hypothesis is that many of these compounds, except for retinoids, act primarily as antioxidants to decrease cell damage (Figure 8), in particular DNA damage, thus lowering the incidences of functional mutations in DNA resulting in lower incidences of cancer.
Many of these vitamins and minerals are present in adequate concentrations in most dog feeds,
and their usefulness in neoplasia once already diagnosed, are largely undetermined. There are multiple human epidemiologic longevity and relative risk studies in progress, using many of these
potential anti-carcinogenic agents. However, to date the indiscriminate use of these antioxidants
as supplements cannot be supported in veterinary medicine because of the very different dietary
patterns and metabolism of these substances in veterinary as compared to human patients.

Antioxidants help the organism combat the destructive effects of free radicals, which are unstable
elements continuously produced by the organism. The role of antioxidants constitutes one of the
dominant themes in current medical research, particularly in the prevention or treatment of certain
cancers.

416

β-Carotene, and other natural
carotenoids and polyphenol compounds have been linked to cancer
prevention through their ability to
scavenge free radicals within cells
in vitro (Duthie et al, 2003; Cooper,
2004). β-carotene has been one of
the most widely studied antioxidants in cancer prevention due to
its potent antioxidant capabilities.
Studies in humans predisposed to
neoplasia (lung cancer) have
shown that β-carotene supplementation may actually increase the
relative risk of neoplasia (Bendich,
2004; Russell, 2004). Considering
these recent findings supplemental
β-carotene in human medicine has
evolved into a cautionary tale of
micro-nutrient supplementation.
Sources of carotenoids, (β-carotene,
lutein, lycopene, xanthene), generally found in red, green, yellow

3 - Nutritional considerations for cancer and cachexia

and orange colored fruits and vegetables, are receiving significant attention because of their beneficial effects in specific cancers (Wu et al, 2004; Murtaugh et al, 2004). However, their benefit in
companion animals is confounded by the fact that carotenoids are absorbed differently in dogs
than in humans. Dogs have a far better capacity to cleave β-carotene into retinal than humans,
and absorb very little intact β-carotene (Baskin et al, 2000). In light of these findings safety and
efficacy data is needed in veterinary medicine before recommendations can be made for supplementing cancer patients with these potentially beneficial antioxidants.
Vitamins C and E are both potent antioxidants which have been shown in human clinical trials
to reduce the risk of carcinogenesis (Henson et al, 1991; Slung et al, 2003; Virtamo et al, 2003). Much
like β-carotene, these antioxidants have been proven to be preventative rather than therapeutic.
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has been associated with augmenting the effects of certain chemotherapeutic agents such as vincristine (Osmak et al, 1997). While ascorbic acid supplements may help
in some cases of drug resistant chemotherapy, it has also been argued that their use may have tumor
promoting effects for some neoplasias, and anti-neoplastic activities for others (Seifried et al, 2003;
Lee et al, 2003). No controlled studies have been performed to assess its efficacy in the veterinary
patient. Ascorbic acid is synthesized in the dog therefore the relative risk of neoplasia due to deficiency over the lifetime of the animal is not an known. Vitamin E, on the other hand, is required in the diet and further investigation into its efficacy as an anti-neoplastic agent is warranted.
Retinoids (Retinoic acid and retinoic acid derivatives) have been extensively used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemias, and have been associated with increased remission rates
in human mammary cancer (Paik et al, 2003; Altucci et al, 2004). They attach to nuclear receptors
initiating transcription of genes, promoting cellular differentiation or apoptosis of neoplastic cells.
These findings have lead to the use of natural and synthetic retinoid derivatives in the treatment
of human cancer. In time such approaches may cross over to veterinary medicine as experimental clinical data is collected regarding efficacy of these retinoids in various neoplastic conditions
in animals. Considering the highly potent effects of retinoids, such as retinoic acid which is a
known teratogen, and due to toxic effects, e.g cervical spondylosis in cats, as well as anorexia and
clotting disorders, recommendations cannot be made at this time for their use in the small animal cancer therapy (Hayes, 1982).
Selenium is the only mineral known to have anti-tumorigenic and preventative properties. There
is conclusive evidence that higher serum selenium concentrations are associated with lower incidences of skin, lung and prostate carcinomas in humans (Duffield-Lillico et al, 2003; Reid et al, 2002;
Nelson et al, 1999; Clark et al, 1996). These actions are thought to be separate from the antioxidant properties of selenium via its role in glutathione peroxidase.

Cancer/Cachexia

The AAFCO dog food nutrient profile recommended concentration of selenium is met in most
commercial pet foods, but the NRC recommendation has recently tripled, therefore the selenium
intake of many companion animals may be low normal or deficient. In light of this, and the human
clinical studies showing that selenium supplementation has the greatest effects in reducing the
relative risk of cancer in those people with low normal serum selenium concentrations (Clark et
al, 1996; Nelson et al, 1999; Reid et al, 2002; Duffield-Lillico et al, 2003), it may be wise to supplement
(2-4 µg/kg BW/day) animals with a history of neoplasia or a predisposition to develop cancer. At
this conservative recommended dose the risks for toxicity are minimal and such supplementation
will likely ensure adequate selenium intake.
Overall, when using specific nutrients pharmacologically one may be able to retard tumor growth, enhance quality of life and ameliorate body condition to a certain extent. Yet, it can be difficult to address the specific needs for each neoplastic condition due to the complex nature of cancer, and the various nutrient compositions of the variety of feeds that are available. To properly
address these nutritional issues, the practitioner needs to know the food consumption and the dry

matter content of various nutrients in the given
feed, before an effort to alter ratios or total intake
of many of the aforementioned nutrients can be
made. Table 5 provides some guidelines for nutritional intervention that should be beneficial in
most aggressive neoplastic conditions and can be
used once the practitioner has calculated contents
of various nutrients in the given food.

4 - Nutritional
intervention during
cancer treatment

In recent years there has been a significant increase in the use of antioxidants in pet foods, which
has hypothetically been associated with less free
radical damage in cells throughout the body. This antioxidant supplementation has been associated with amelioration of a variety of different disease processes (Figure 9).

* It is essential to know either or both the omega-3 fatty acid, omega-6 fatty acid content
in dry matter to properly formulate the diet at the desired ratio.

Though these approaches to cancer prevention may be beneficial in theory, once the veterinary
patient has been diagnosed with cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, use
of various antioxidants may actually be contraindicated. If antioxidants are used to prevent free
radical damage, and a chemical or radiation treatment has been initiated, the higher levels of cytosolic or membrane bound antioxidant may actually provide a survival advantage to cancer cells.
Therefore, it has been recommended by many veterinary oncologists that pets not be given these
antioxidant supplements during such treatment. This hypothesis is very controversial, and has yet
to be proven. Since the veterinary patient is usually already ingesting sufficient amounts of the
essential antioxidants, supplementation may not be necessary (Virtamo et al, 2003; Prasad, 2004).

Massive antioxidant supplementation may be contra-indicated during
chemotherapy or radiation therapy, as antioxidant supplementation may
facilitate the survival of cancer cells.

418

On the other hand, many other ingredients and nutrients such as fish oil and
arginine, are unlikely to be detrimental.
Indeed, supplementation with fish oil has
been associated with better radiation therapy recovery and less inflammation to
surrounding tissue. Studies in animal
models have also suggested that the
increase in long chain polyunsaturated
fatty acids in cell membranes resulting
from fish oil supplementation may actually provide more highly reactive fatty acids
for lipid peroxidation during radiation
therapy, thus promoting cell death in the
neoplastic tissue (Colas et al, 2004).

Conclusion

Conclusion
Clinical veterinary studies have shown that a number of metabolic anomalies produced in human
and rodent cancer models are also found in dogs. The nutritional approach to cancer used in
human medicine could therefore be adapted to veterinary medicine to influence the progression
of the cancer.

Q

A

If my dog refuses to eat a new food
can I give fish oil on top of the
present feed?

Fish oil can be added to regular grocery store brand dog food, but it is ideal to know how much
omega-3 fatty acids is already present in the food. A typical beagle, eating a typical grocery store
brand food will eat about 6 grams of omega 6 fatty acids a day and only 100 mg of omega-3 fatty
acids, so to get to a 1:1 ratio, you would need about 6 grams of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil.
Remember that only 30% of fish oil are omega-3 fatty acids, so you have to triple the fish oil given,
thus 18 grams or just over a tablespoon is needed each day.

My dog doesn’t like the fish oil.
Can I give another source of
omega-3 fatty acids?

Flax-seed oil is rich in linolenic acid, a EPA-DHA precursor. It may prove interesting but its clinical efficiency has not been demonstrated with respect to cancer. Another alternative is to feed descented fish oil or lemon flavored fish oil.

If an owner wants to use
various antioxidants, which are
recommended, and when should
they be given if radiation or
chemotherapy treatment
has been initiated?

The antioxidants that are likely to be safest are those that have the most clinical and cell biological research behind them. Often vitamin E and vitamin C come to mind. Recent research on thiol
antioxidants like lipoic acid and the glutathione precursor s-adenosyl-methionine, both of which
have few to no known side effects, maybe of interest. If owners feel strongly about using these
antioxidants, it is ideal to use them as directed by the manufacturers, and using veterinary formulated products is often safer than using human formulations. If dogs are receiving
chemotherapy/radiation treatments then removing all supplemental antioxidants one week before
treatment and continuing them again one week after the treatment protocol has been terminated
is likely to be the safest approach at this time.

Some owners feel that changing
their animal to a “holistic” or
“homemade” diet would provide
some benefit during cancer, is
this a wise approach?

Often owners find diets on the internet that have been designed for canine cancer patients and will
implement them, hoping they will prolong survival or cure the neoplasia. More often than not,
there are gross imbalances in vitamins and minerals in these diets. It is ideal to have a veterinary
nutritionist intervene in these cases and analyze the proposed diet to ensure that there are no gross
imbalances.

Often in the anorexia/cachexia
syndrome it becomes difficult to
implement the diet changes needed,
and a diet with lower caloric density
may be the diet of choice by the
patient? What should the owner do?

In those cases it easier to let the patient choose their feed and attempt to supplement fat and
protein sources to increase the caloric density and protein content of the meal. Remember during
anorexia/cachexia some caloric intake though not optimal for the disease is better than no caloric
intake at all.

Key Points
to remember in:

Nutritional management
of dogs with cancer

Cancer/Cachexia

• The preferred energy sources are
fat and protein, at the expense
of carbohydrate, which is highly
valued by cancer cells. The main
principles of formulation are the
same as diets that meet the
requirements of sporting and
working dogs.
• Fat helps to increase the energy
concentration of the food, which
is necessary in anorectic or
cachexic patients.
• Enriching the long-chain omega
3 fatty acid (EPA-DHA) content in
the food helps the dog benefit
from the anti-neoplastic properties of EPA-DHA.

424

• A high-protein diet helps combat
muscle wasting during cancer
cachexia. The amino acids that
play an important role in slowing
the progression of the tumor,
include:
- arginine, which favors nitric
oxide production
- glutamine, which has immunemodulating actions
- branched chain amino acids (e.g.
leucine, isoleucine and valine),
which help combat cachexia.

• Antioxidant supplementation
(e.g. vitamins E and C, β-carotene,
polyphenols, selenium) is of
major interest in preventing cancer. However, based on our
knowledge at this time, antioxidant supplementation should be
avoided during chemotherapy or
radiation therapy so that the
efficacies of these therapies are
not compromised.
• The palatability of the food is
key in anorexic and cachectic
dogs.

Focus on:

BRANCHED CHAIN AMINO ACIDS
Among the essential amino acids,
leucine, isoleucine and valine
constitute a category of their own
called the branched chain amino
acids (BCAA's). The dog is incapable of synthesizing adequate
amounts of these three amino
acids, so dietary intake is needed to
meet daily requirements. The
concentration of these three
amino acids in the blood is very
dependent on dietary intake.

essential amino acids because they
are able to undergo reversible
transamination to enrich the organism’s nitrogen pool.

Valine, leucine and isoleucine
represent at least one third of the
essential amino acids constituting
muscle proteins and are the only
amino acids that are initially
degraded by muscles. These three
amino acids are unique among the

In rats, stimulation of protein synthesis by leucine follows a doseresponse type curve. This stimulation is produced at very low leucine concentrations, identical to
those observed in the blood just
before a meal. In older rats, much

Valine, leucine and isoleucine are
able to stimulate the synthesis of
proteins and slow protein degradation in muscles. This property
has been specifically attributed to
leucine, as it proves as effective as
a mixture of the three BCAA’s.

higher leucine concentrations are
needed to obtain maximum stimulation (INRA, 2002). The sensitivity
to leucine intake is therefore reduced. This loss of sensitivity may
explain the absence of increased
muscle protein synthesis after
meals in aging subjects.

T
Critical care

he beneﬁcial effects derived from the nutritional support
of diseased human patients and experimental animal models
include enhanced immune function, wound repair, response
to therapy, recovery time, and survival. Despite these beneﬁts,
the nutritional needs of hospitalized patients are often ignored
due to the intense focus on life-threatening medical and surgical
problems. The goal of nutritional support is to provide energy
and nutrients in proportions that can be utilized by
the patient with maximal efﬁciency.

426

1 - Pathophysiology

Malnutrition is probably more common in veterinary patients than is recognized. Malnutrition is
an unbalanced intake of protein and/or calories to support tissue metabolism and has the potential to undermine proper medical or surgical therapeutic management of a hospital case (Remillard
et al, 2001). Some dogs are likely to be deﬁcient in either protein and/or calories due to a reduction in food intake.
A recent publication estimated the proportion of hospitalized canine patients in a negative energy balance (Remillard et al, 2001). The study was conducted at four veterinary referral hospitals
across the USA. Overall, daily feeding data and outcomes for 276 dogs over 821 days in the hospital were evaluated. In 73% of those days a negative energy balance was obtained (< 95% RER
[resting energy requirement]).
This was attributed to three main factors:
- 22% due to poorly written orders
- 34% due to orders to withhold food
- 44% of the dogs refused to eat.
Overall, the study found that caloric intake had a signiﬁcant, positive effect on patient outcome.

1 - Pathophysiology
Simple starvation implies that the patient is healthy,
but is somehow deprived of food, while complicated
starvation is reserved for patients where disease has
induced a state of anorexia. The ability of the body
to respond to starvation is often altered in disease.
Therefore, the healthy dog’s ability to cope with
starvation should not be relied upon exclusively as a
model for the sick and anorexic patient. Many disease states may result in an increased need for both
energy and additional nutrients beyond what is
required during simple starvation (Table 1).

TABLE 1 - INFLUENCE OF STARVATION
AND STRESS ON METABOLISM

Starvation

Physiological stress

Activation of mediators
Protein synthesis
Catabolism
Gluconeogenesis

There are marked elevations in catecholamines, glucocorticoids and glucagon in patients that are physiologically stressed. Although the exact increase in
nutrient requirements in differing states of complicated starvation is not known, it is signiﬁcant justiﬁcation for nutritional support.

Energy expenditure
Malnutrition level

No evidence suggests that there are speciﬁc and consistent risk factors for needing nutritional
support. Disease severity has been the only common factor among patients in need of nutritional
support.

Critical care

Independent of breed predisposition for diseases that require nutritional support for patient management, no breed is more likely to need nutritional support than another.

2 - Indications for nutritional support
Some clinicians ﬁnd it helpful to have metrics to use to determine when to intervene with nutritional support. Ideally, a speciﬁc and sensitive biomarker that is easily measured would exist as
such an indicator. Unfortunately, despite attempts at identiﬁcation, no one reliable indicator exists
(De Bruijne, 1979; Fascetti et al, 1997). However, there are recommendations in the literature regar427

2 - Indications for nutritional support

ding patient criteria that can serve as indicators to when nutritional support should be instituted
(Remillard et al, 2001).

First criterion: the length of anorexia prior
to presentation or anticipated duration of anorexia
Canine patients that have been anorexic for three to ﬁve days are already in a state of starvation
and, based on human respiratory quotients (RQs), are relying mainly on muscle and adipose tissue
as energy substrates (Owen et al, 1979). There are no protein stores in the body, and, therefore, any
catabolism results in the loss of functional proteins. A state of protein catabolism is contraindicated in any state of disease and minimizing or eliminating this catabolism is vital to the successful
management of critically ill patients.
If anorexia lasts or is expected
to last at least three to ﬁve days,
it should elicit a nutritional response
(enteral or parenteral feeding).

Not all patients have a clear starting point regarding anorexia. The client may not have recognized diminished food intake depending on the patient’s home environment and the feeding strategy employed.
- Food intake for patients residing in a multi-dog household fed ad libitum is notoriously difﬁcult
to assess.
- Clients may, in hindsight, be reluctant to admit the length of anorexia or may exaggerate food
intake.
In order to address this difﬁculty, the authors recommend that the practitioner make an effort to
quantify the volume of food that the animal is consuming. Using this information, the approximate caloric intake of the patient can be calculated and compared to the animal’s energy requirement (see section 5B for energy requirement calculations).
It is even more difﬁcult to anticipate the length of expected anorexia. Disease progression is inherently unpredictable; however, many diseases do behave relatively predictably. In cases where there
is a high likelihood that the patient will not eat voluntarily, plans should be made to provide nutritional support. Anticipating the potential need for nutritional intervention when patients undergo anesthesia for further diagnostics or treatment is strongly recommended. In this case, concurrently placing a feeding tube during the procedure is a critical management strategy. This approach
drastically increases the odds that patients in need of nutritional support will receive it.

Other criteria: body condition score,
body weight change and albumin status

Critical care

There are three parameters that need to be monitored in order to ensure that nutritional support
is adequate.
- Patients with a body condition score of less than 3 on a 9-point scale (Laﬂamme et al, 1994) or 2
on a 5-point scale (Edney & Smith, 1986) should be considered to be in poor nutritional status,
and nutritional support should be considered immediately (Figure 1).
- A body weight reduction of greater than ﬁve or ten percent that is not due to dehydration also
signals the need for immediate nutritional support.
- Hypoalbuminemia due to decreased production is a clear indicator that intervention should
occur.

3 - Supplementary tests
Diet history
Collecting an accurate and complete diet history should be done for every patient and can prove
to be very helpful in determining the length and degree of anorexia. Clients should be carefully

questioned not only about the brand and type of food offered, but also about the amount and the
feeding frequency. The diet history should include enough detail to allow for the total daily caloric intake to be determined and compared to the calculated caloric requirement. The determination of food intake is often complicated by the fact that many clients have moved away from the
patients’ typical diets to novel foods in an attempt to entice their pets to eat. The new foods are
frequently higher in moisture and/or fat content. The loss of an easy comparison makes interpreting unintentional weight loss difﬁcult. There is a natural tendency to assume that the patient’s
food consumption has been adequate, since that would imply a better prognosis to the client and
that the veterinarian would not need to intercede with nutritional support. However, this assumption must be proven quantitatively.

Critical care

Fortunately, the advent of the internet has made previously difﬁcult to ﬁnd energy density data
more accessible to anyone with computer access. Many pet food manufacturers’ websites provide
kilocalories per volume or kilogram often not found on their product labels. In addition, product
guides are readily available from many manufacturers. Energy density data for human foods can
be easily obtained from the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, which is available
at www.nal.usda.gov. The lead author’s (SJD) website (www.balanceit.com) is also designed to provide information for petfood as well as for human food. With these tools, accurate and complete
diet histories can be evaluated in all patients and used to determine the degree and length of
patient anorexia.

429

3 - Supplementary tests

Body weight
Determination of a patient’s body weight, adjusted for hydration status, is an important clinical
measurement. However, for the critically ill patient in need of nutritional support, its value is diminished unless recent body weight data is available. Comparisons should only be made based on
readings from the same scale, since scale-to-scale variation can be misleading.
Every animal should be weighed, and weight readings should be recorded daily during hospitalization. Intervention that only occurs when the patient has lost weight while hospitalized is a poor
management strategy. Ideally, all hospitalized patients will remain relatively weight stable or, if
indicated, gain weight during their stay. Weight gain should be interpreted cautiously as most
patients will gain weight upon rehydration. Thus, every patient should be weighed daily to ensure that nutritional intervention is appropriate. The routine occurrence of weight loss in hospitalized patients should be a clear sign to the clinician that nutritional intervention is not
adequate or has not been instituted soon enough.

Body composition

© Royal Canin

Clinical assessment of body composition is limited to a validated system of using visual
and tactile cues for assessing adiposity (Laﬂamme et al, 1994). Although the body condition scoring system has limitations, such as in its inability to quantify lean body mass,
it requires minimal training and no special patient preparation or equipment.
More precise experimental methods of determining body composition such as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), bioelectrical impedance, and stable isotope dilution,
are technically and economically demanding, limiting their clinical use.
Thus, the use of a body condition score (BCS) is the most practical method of quantifying a patient’s body composition (Figure 1 and see Chapter 1). It is also an excellent

be used to determine the rate of unintentional
weight loss.
even the most experienced clinician, the use of a BCS does provide an insight into the
patient’s overall nutritional status that cannot be achieved by measuring body weight
alone. Therefore, a BCS should be used as a measure of the “chronic” condition, and daily body
weight changes should be used as indicators of the more “acute” condition.
Body weight and BCS are usually not dynamic enough for daily evaluations and adjustments, but
rather they are a better indicator of an animal’s long-term response to nutritional support.

Albumin status

Critical care

Approximately 50% of all daily protein synthesis is committed to the production of albumin.
Inadequate intake of dietary protein can impair that production. However, given that albumin’s
half-life in the dog is approximately eight days, reﬂective changes in albumin status can take days
to occur (Kaneko et al, 1997). An example of the discrepancy between albumin status and caloric
intake is provided in a paper by De Bruijne (1979). In this study, no changes in blood albumin
concentrations were detected in healthy dogs undergoing simple starvation for 21 days. In another study, admission serum albumin concentration of 105 hospitalized dogs was shown to have a
statistically signiﬁcant predictive value regarding clinical outcome (Michel, 1993). Thus, reductions in albumin should be seen as evidence that production is severely decreased, or may not be
keeping up with demand, or that losses are excessive. Consequently, normoalbuminemia should
not be used as justiﬁcation for foregoing nutritional intervention.

4 - Determination of the best
approach regarding nutritional
support: decision trees

© Mercier

Currently, no single clinical pathology or biochemical marker exists that helps to
determine the nutritional status of dogs. Leukopenia, creatine kinase in cats and proteins such as C-reactive protein, prealbumin, transferrin and retinol binding protein
in humans have all been investigated as measures of nutritional status. However, all
of these biomarkers are affected by multiple other factors that render their interpretation difﬁcult (Phang & Aeberhardt, 1996; Fascetti et al, 1997). At this time, the clinician’s best tools for nutritionally assessing their patients are:
- complete medical and dietary histories
- physical examinations
- body weights
- current and historical BCSs
- and routine blood work.
Weighing a West Highland White Terrier

Early enteral nutrition helps combat weight
loss and minimizes the effects of catabolism in
diseases such as parvoviral gastroenteritis.

4 - Determination of the best approach regarding nutritional support

Other Biomarkers

Nutrients can be administered two ways: enterally or parenterally. It is the clinician’s
responsibility to determine the best approach regarding nutritional support for each patient (Figure
2).
Parenteral nutrition should be used only when enteral feeding is not possible. Parenteral nutrition
is complicated, more expensive and concerns regarding infection exist.

5 - Enteral nutrition
Enteral nutrition should be the ﬁrst choice for nutritional management unless the patient’s
condition can not support enteral feedings. The mantra “If the gut works, use it” was derived
because enteral feeding is considered more physiologically sound than intravenous feeding.
Enteral feeding maintains the health of the gastrointestinal tract, and prevents bacterial translocation. A recent randomized controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of early enteral
nutrition in dogs with parvo-viral enteritis, compared to nil per os (Mohr et al, 2003).

Different types of tubes
for enteral nutrition
The appetite of the hospitalized patient typically waxes and wanes. Hence the meal is
offered orally, and if not consumed, is blended and administered via a tube.
> Nasoesophageal tubes

This type of tube is an excellent option for short-term feeding (<7 days) of hospitalized patients. Nasoesophageal tubes do not require specialized equipment and are not
expensive. Generally tubes between 3-8F are selected. For a dog, the optimal length
of the nasoesophageal tube is equal to the distance from the tip of the nose to the
seventh rib.

Most critically ill patients will tolerate
nasoesophageal tube placement, but some
individuals may require sedation.
431

Critical care

Enteral nutrition was associated with a shorter time to recovery, increased body
weight gain, and improved gut barrier function. This study suggests that early enteral feeding is associated with more rapid clinical improvement. Enteral feeding can
be achieved via nasoesophageal, esophagostomy, gastrostomy or jejunostomy
devices.

4 - Determination of the best approach regarding nutritional support

FIGURE 2 - ALGORITHM TO ASSIST THE SELECTION OF THE TYPE OF NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT TO IMPLEMENT
1. Is the patient meeting its resting energy requirement (RER = 70 x (hydrated
body weight in kilograms)0.75) with voluntary consumption of food?

Yes. Nutritional support probably not indicated.
Continue voluntary oral feedings.

No. Nutritional support indicated.

2. Is the patient actively vomiting, has severe intractable diarrhea, anesthetized, unable
to have a feeding tube placed, suffering from severe pancreatitis & cannot have a jejunostomy
tube placed or recovering from major gastric and/or bowel resection?

Yes. Parenteral administration of nutrients
probably indicated.

No. Enteral administration of nutrients
probably indicated.

3. Is a central line (i.e. jugular, medial saphenous,
etc.) in place or can it be placed?

7. Can the patient be anesthetized?

Yes
Yes. Centrally administered
parenteral solution should
be used.

4. Is the patient uremic, at risk of
becoming uremic or suffering from
hepatic encephalopathy when fed
a diet with greater than 15%
protein calories?

5. Does the patient’s
RER need to be met
exclusively through the
administration of the
peripheral parenteral
solution?

Yes

Critical care

Yes. Use a low
protein central
parenteral
solution.

See Table 1

No. Use
a “normal”
protein central
parenteral
solution.

No

No. Peripherally administered
parenteral solution should
be used.

No. Use a
“normal” fat
peripheral
parenteral solution.

8. Is the patient suffering from
pancreatitis and/or does the
stomach and duodenum need
to be bypassed?

Yes. Consider placing
a 5-8 Fr jejunostomy
tube.

9. Is the dog greater than 15 kg?

No

10. Is it anticipated that the patient will
need the feeding tube for more than a
couple of months and/or does the patient
have abnormal esophageal function?

Yes. Place
an 8 Fr
nasoesophageal feeding
tube.

No. Place a
5 Fr nasoesophageal
feeding tube.

6. Is the patient
hyperlipidemic?

Yes. Use a low fat peripheral parenteral solution
delivered at less than RER and reconsider whether
at least some enteral administration of diet is
possible.

No. Consider use of
a high fat peripheral
parenteral solution.

Yes. Place an 18-24 Fr
gastrostomy tube
either surgically or
endoscopically.

No. Place a 12-18 Fr
esophagostomy
tube.

However, the small diameter of the tube can be inconvenient and mandates only liquid feedings. Nasoesophageal tubes may also increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia if the tube is
either inadvertently placed in the trachea, or the pet regurgitates the tube and it is inhaled into
the trachea. To minimize this complication, the placement of the nasoesophageal tube should
always be ascertained prior to feeding.

There are three ways of placing
an esophagostomy tube:

Contraindications include patients that have had severe facial trauma involving the nares, protracted vomiting and/or regurgitation, semiconsciousness, or those patients that have laryngeal,
pharyngeal, or esophageal physical or functional abnormalities.

> Esophagostomy tubes

Esophagostomy tubes are indicated for patients requiring medium term nutritional support. Esophagostomy tubes are generally well tolerated and can easily be placed under a light anesthetic
with minimal equipment. The only major associated complication is the potential for infection
at the entry site and meticulous care of the surgical wound is
essential to maintain the tube. Indications include patients with
mandibular, maxillary, nasal and nasopharyngeal disease or an

inability to prehend or masticate.
The patient is lightly anesthetized, placed in right lateral recumbency, and an aseptic preparation of the left cervical region is performed. A 5-12 Fr red rubber, plastic or silicone feeding tube can
be placed.

Feeding through the tube can commence once the patient has
recovered from anesthesia. The food must be presented in the
form of liquid slurry: it may be a dry or canned food mixed with
water or a ready to use solution. The wound will heal via granulation tissue within two weeks of tube removal.

The tip of the esophagostomy tube should be placed in the midesophagus. The exterior portion of the tube is secured to the neck
via butterﬂy or Chinese ﬁnger trap suture.

Gastrostomy tubes are available in several
sizes and designs and are constructed of
latex or silicone. The most common initial
placement design is a latex Pezzar-type
mushroom catheter. Silicone tubes
typically survive 6-12 months and are less
irritating at the stoma site.

FIGURE 4 - ILLUSTRATION OF A LOW PROFILE
GASTROSTOMY TUBE AFTER PLACEMENT

More recently low-proﬁle gastrostomy devices (LPGD’s) have
been developed and are available in North America for both
initial and replacement procedures. These devices are positioned ﬂush with the body wall (Figure 4). LPGD’s are constructed of silicone and appear to cause less stoma site inﬂammation.
A feeding adapter is attached to the end of the device during
the feeding procedure.

Client and patient acceptance is much higher than with
traditional tubes as the patient appears “normal” without a
long tube attached to the body or the need for a stockinette
cover. In addition, the mushroom tip has an anti-ﬂux valve
design to prevent reﬂux of gastric contents.
LPGD's are expensive but have been documented
to last at least 12 months.

Critical care

Gastrostomy tubes are available in several sizes; 18-20 Fr are
appropriate for small dogs, and 24 Fr are adequate for larger
dogs. Tubes are constructed of latex or silicone. Various designs
are available (Figure 3). An array of feeding adapters can be
attached to the feeding tube; a Y-port device is preferred as it
has two ports:
- a catheter port for administration of food when the tube has
been in place for at least 24 hours
- a Luer tip syringe port used for oral medication.

Jejunostomy tube feeding is justiﬁed only when the stomach or the duodenum must be by-passed. The tube is typically placed via laparotomy
and enteropexy. The food used must be liquid and elemental as tubes are
typically 5-8 Fr in diameter and inserted directly into the jejunum.

Enteral tube feeding:
practical aspects

Latex tubes are less expensive but generally require
replacement within 8-12 weeks due to tube wear and
tear.

Water is introduced through the feeding tube 12-18 hours following initial
placement (except for feeding via the esophagus when no delay is necessary), and feeding is scheduled to begin within 24-36 hrs. Generally 1/2 to
1/3 of the daily caloric intake (typically RER) is administered on the ﬁrst
day.
*RER = 70 x (body weight in kg)0.75 = kilocalories/day

If no complications occur, the amount fed is gradually increased to reach
total caloric requirements by the third or fourth day, or the seventh day in case of prolonged starvation.

© DA Elliott

The total volume of food is divided into 4-6 equal sized meals which should not exceed the gastric capacity of the patient (initially 5 mL/kg to up to 15 mL/kg per feeding). The food should be
warmed to room temperature and administered slowly, over 5-15 mins (Figure 6). Upon completion, the tube should be ﬂushed with 5-10 mL of tepid water.

An endoscope should be used to verify
that the gastrostomy tube is in the
correct position.

FIGURE 6 ENTERAL FEEDING

Frequent small meals are generally better tolerated than larger less frequent meals. If the owner
feels able to continue frequent feedings when the dog is discharged from the hospital then such a
regimen should be continued. However, if frequency will need to be reduced, it is important that
the dog is adapted to the larger less frequent meals that the owner will employ at home prior to
discharge. With time and adaptation to the feeding procedure, the meal frequency may be reduced to a convenient BID to TID daily schedule.
Prior to every meal, the gastric residuals should be aspirated with a syringe. If more than 50% of
the prior feeding is present, the contents should be returned to the stomach and the feeding skipped until the next scheduled time. Frequent aspiration of the previous meal may suggest delayed
gastric emptying and warrant medical management (e.g. metoclopramide 20-30 minutes prior to
feeding).

Critical care

Research shows no beneﬁcial effect from continuous intragastric feeding over intermittent enteral feeding with regard to weight gain and nitrogen balance in healthy dogs (Chandler et al, 1996).
However, in animals that are volume intolerant, continuous administration of nutrients is better
tolerated.

The diet is blended with the least
amount of water required to
achieve syringability. If the food
is administered as a slurry, the
tip of the syringe must be
sufﬁciently wide to prevent
obstruction.

434

Most oral medications should be administered prior to feeding, with the exception of phosphate
binders that must be mixed directly with the food.
The position of the tube on the body wall should be examined daily for migration and the stoma
site inspected for pain, redness, odor and discharge (Figure 7). The site should be cleaned daily
with an antiseptic solution and antimicrobial ointment applied. Food residue should not be left
near the stoma.

FIGURE 7 - MIGRATION OF THE GASTROSTOMY

Nutritional support

TUBE IN THE SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE

> Water

Water is one of the four basic macronutrients, and, in a state of deﬁciency, will cause the most immediate detrimental effects. Therefore,
nutritional support in its most minimal form is provided to most hospitalized patients in the form of ad libitum water and/or parenterally
administered ﬂuids. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to only administer the minimum and provide no further support. Fluid therapy
should be viewed as a component of nutritional support and not as
complete nutritional support.

This situation is a surgical
emergency as it may
result in septic peritonitis.

Most veterinary clinical nutritionists believe that the energy requirement of most hospitalized patients is close to a patient’s resting
energy requirement (RER), calculated using the above equation
(Remillard et al, 2001).

© DA Elliott

> Energy density of the diet

Although this equation does not always meet the patient’s precise needs, it serves as a starting
point that should minimize the likelihood of overfeeding or underfeeding the patient. It is the
authors’ experience that, for most dogs, using RER results in weight stability and maintenance of
the patient’s BCS during several weeks of hospitalization.
To keep the volume of any single bolus at a minimum, the energy density of the diet must be maximized. To achieve this, the volume and type of liquid used to lower the viscosity of a canned food
must be carefully selected. The importance of ﬁnding a balance between slurry energy density and
viscosity cannot be overemphasized. Even small increases in the kilocalories per unit volume can
often have a large impact on the frequency and the volume of enteral feedings. This, in turn, can
signiﬁcantly affect the success of the feeding program and the ability to meet the animal’s energy
requirements.
Oil provides the maximum amount of energy, but also the greatest dilutional effect on nutrients.
Thus, essential nutrients can be signiﬁcantly decreased inadvertently. Using water does not change
the ratio of nutrients to kilocalories, but does decrease the amount of kilocalories per unit volume.
Alternatively corn or maple syrup can be used in dogs to increase the energy density of a slurry
while still decreasing the diet’s viscosity. In most cases, water can effectively be used to create slurries that can then be fed through a 12 Fr or larger feeding tube. As a general guide, increasing the
canned diet to a moisture level of 80% typically creates a slurry once blenderized that is both relatively energy dense (diet dependent) and easily administered (Figure 8).
> Balance of energy sources

Critical care

The basic macronutrients that provide energy are protein, fat and carbohydrate. When the
patient’s resting energy requirement is not met with the administration of a single energy-providing macronutrient, there is debate as to how the macronutrient is utilized. Some believe that all
macronutrients are used solely for energy until the patient’s energy requirements are met. Others
advocate that some substrates may have a limited, protein-sparing effect even when the patient’s
caloric requirements are not being achieved.

• Fats
High fat diets, as a rule, are usually well accepted and tolerated. Fat provides at least twice as many
calories per unit of volume, thereby enabling an increased caloric consumption in patients with

limited food intake. Although fat can increase the palatability and the initial acceptance of a diet,
it is the authors’ experience that sudden increases in dietary fat appear to be one of the most consistent and least recognized causes of gastrointestinal distress, especially pancreatitis.
Many highly digestible commercial foods are not fat-restricted and often provide up to 30% of the
calories from fat. The use of these diets should be limited to patients in which there is no concern
of fat intolerance.
When initially refeeding a hospitalized patient, such foods as cottage cheese or skinless chicken
combined with rice are often recommended. These foods are palatable, highly digestible and are
excellent alternatives to high-fat commercial foods.

• Amino acids
Enterally administered amino acids such as glutamine have been suggested to have a protein-sparing effect. There is one study that supports the potential beneﬁt of enterally administered glutamine based on whole-body leucine kinetics (Humbert et al, 2002).

Critical care

Unfortunately, there is no clinical evidence that a patient will tolerate an enterally administered
amino acid solution in amounts to meet their energy needs, when they will not tolerate a complete diet. However, a constant rate infusion of an enteral product below the patient’s RER, with
the concurrent administration of the remaining caloric requirement parenterally may be of value
in reducing the occurrence of villous atrophy and bacterial translocation (Qin et al, 2002; Kotani
et al, 1999).

5 - Enteral nutrition

Complications linked to enteral feeding
For critically ill dogs, the majority of the monitoring is focused on avoiding complications associated with nutritional support.
> Surgical complications

Splenic laceration, gastric hemorrhage, pneumoperitoneum, displacement into the peritoneal
cavity and peritonitis have been reported as infrequent placement complications.
Patient tolerance of the feeding tube should be closely observed. This can manifest as sneezing,
cellulitus at the stoma, gagging, and/or vomiting, depending upon the type of tube. The major
associated complication is the potential for infection at the entry site.
Meticulous care of the surgical wound is essential to maintain the tube. Abnormalities at the stoma
site including discharge, pain, swelling, erythema, abscess formation and ulceration which can be
minimized by strict attention to cleaning and prohibiting the patient from licking the site. Warm
packs containing antiseptic solution placed on the stoma site will minimize problems or hasten
recovery.

FIGURE 9 - FIXATION
OF THE TUBE

Inappropriate patient removal of the tube is undoubtedly the most problematic complication. In
one review approximately 20% of dogs removed their gastrostomy tubes which emphasizes the
importance of restraining the gastrostomy tube in a stockinette and utilizing e-collars (Figure 9)
(Elliott et al, 2000).

© DA Elliott

Patient removal of the gastrostomy tube is an emergency. In most situations a new tube can be
placed through the existing stoma site using a guide catheter. Appropriate replacement should be
veriﬁed radiographically following injection of an iodinated contrast agent. If the tube has been
in place for less than seven days, or there is evidence of peritonitis or radiographic contrast agent
leakage, an exploratory laparotomy is required to correct the situation. The use of LPGD’s may
reduce the incidence of inadvertent gastrostomy tube removal.
> Obstruction of the tube

Periodically tubes will become blocked with food. Techniques to facilitate removal of the obstruction include massaging the outside of the tube while simultaneously ﬂushing and aspirating
with water; instilling carbonated drinks (e.g. cola soda), meat tenderizers or pancreatic enzyme
solutions for 15 to 20 minutes; or gently using a polyurethane catheter to dislodge the obstruction. The ﬁnal resort is tube removal and replacement.
> Aspiration Pneumonia

A traditional gastrostomy tube
must be protected from the risk
of displacement by the dog.
This can be achieved by securing
the gastrostomy tube to the body
wall, placing a stockinette over
the abdomen, and using an
Elizabethan collar.

The perception of enteral feeding increasing the risk of aspiration pneumonia in the critically ill
patient is most likely justiﬁed if the enteral feeding increases the risk of the patient vomiting, or
aspirating or if the patient is laterally recumbent, sedated or anesthetized. Incorrectly positioned
nasoesophageal tubes will cause aspiration pneumonia when the food is inadvertently placed into
the trachea, and not the esophagus.

Critical care

Gastric contents following enteral feedings serve as an excellent reservoir of pneumonia-genic
compounds given their acidity and high microbial load. However, it should be noted that a human
produces up to 63 mL per hour of bacteria-laden saliva (McClave & Snider, 2002). Thus, it is most
likely inappropriate to assume that all aspirated material comes from the stomach. The role of
enteral feeding in the development of aspiration pneumonia is controversial in the human arena
(McClave & Snider, 2002). However due to the more horizontal, rather than vertical posture of
dogs, it appears likely to play a signiﬁcant role in the canine patient.

437

5 - Enteral nutrition

> Overfeeding

Volume intolerance is a frequent complication of enteral feeding in humans (Davies et al, 2002) It
can lead to simple nausea or to vomiting.
Intolerance to enteral feeding is
usually related to an excessive meal
volume which exceeds gastric capacity.
The frequency with which clients
can administer feedings is generally
limited. Patient discomfort, the risk
of diarrhea and vomiting can be
minimized by:
- reducing the total volume (increase
the meal frequency and/or
the meal energy density)
- slowing down the rate
of administration
- serving the food at ambient
temperature
- reducing the food’s osmolarity
- simultaneously managing ﬂuid,
electrolyte and acid base
disturbances.

The total number of daily kilocalories to be delivered has a large impact on individual bolus volume.
Overestimating the energy requirement of a patient increases the risk of volume intolerance. In
human medicine, initial energy requirement recommendations for enteral feeding that are too
aggressive often result in the patient receiving fewer kilocalories per day due to skipped feedings
based on residuals and/or volume intolerance (McClave & Snider, 2002).
There is debate regarding the predictive ability of gastric residuals (leftover stomach contents measured by aspiration before the next feeding) in avoiding aspiration pneumonia in humans (McClave
& Snider, 2002). The volume of each feeding may not be solely responsible for residual volume as
gastric emptying rate also plays a role. However, intuitively, it seems like a good indicator of feeding volume tolerance.
Finally, diarrhea can occur with any form of enteral feeding, especially when undigested nutrients
or non-elemental diets are fed too rapidly into the jejunum (due to osmotic effects), or when the
food is too cold.
> Refeeding syndrome

This syndrome may occur after enteral feeding, as studies on cats and humans have shown (Solomon & Kirby, 1990; Justin & Hohenhaus, 1995).

In order to prevent Refeeding
Syndrome, the following three steps
should be taken:
(1) Slow re-introduction of food to
animals that have been unfed for
extended periods (greater than
5 days);
(2) Provide adequate
supplementation of potassium,
phosphorus and potentially
magnesium;
and
(3) Closely monitor electrolytes
during the ﬁrst 24 hours of
refeeding.

In a state of starvation, the body maintains extracellular concentrations of many electrolytes at
the expense of intracellular concentrations. This shift can result in inward rectiﬁcation when glucose and, subsequently, insulin are reintroduced to the patient with refeeding. This inward rush
results in acute decreases in vital serum electrolyte concentrations that can potentially be life
threatening. For example, serum potassium concentration is maintained as intracellular potassium
is depleted. When blood glucose rises in response to feeding, the body releases insulin that pumps
glucose and potassium intracellularly. The result is a rapid and profound hypokalemia (Figure 10).
Hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia have also been reported (Justin & Hohenhaus, 1995;
Macintire, 1997). Hypophosphatemia has been associated with hemolysis and could lead to additional cardiac and neurological complications (Justin & Hohenhaus, 1995).

6 - Parenteral feeding
Parenteral feeding is expensive and technically demanding. It is reserved for cases in which the
digestive tract must be rested for medical or surgical reasons or in recumbent patients.

Practical aspects
> Preparation

Critical care

All the elements are mixed carefully in a sterile bag, in the following order: glucose then amino
acids then lipids. The introduction of lipids at the end avoids the risk of emulsion destabilization.
The bag is refrigerated and the contents used in less than 48 hours by connection to the intravenous infusion system.

Due to their high glucose and amino acid content the solutions for parenteral feeding are
often very hypertonic. Their administration must therefore be accomplished with a central
catheter placed in the cranial (jugular approach – Figure 12) or caudal vena cava (saphenous approach). The major blood ﬂow of these veins permits rapid dilution of the mixture.

6 - Parenteral feeding

> Rate of administration

The rate of administration of parenteral solutions is limited by three main factors - ﬂuid volume,
osmolarity and the creation of metabolic disturbances. Software is available that can adjust the
infusion ﬂow based on the characteristics of the animal.
> Fluid volume

Fluid volume is rarely a major concern except in patients that are ﬂuid overloaded or oliguric/anuric, for example, patients with congestive heart failure, acute renal disease or terminal chronic
renal disease. When ﬂuid volume is a concern, an effort should be made to increase the energy
density of the solution by increasing the lipid emulsion content when possible.

> Electrolyte composition

Critical care

The electrolyte composition of the parenteral solution can also be adjusted along with the amount
of free water to allow for its use as a maintenance ﬂuid and decrease overall administered ﬂuid
volume. Use of a solution with a high osmolarity can increase the risk of thrombophlebitis (Roongpisuthipong et al, 1994). For example, a solution with an osmolarity of 650 mOsmol/L delivered
through a peripheral catheter at maintenance ﬂuid rates is well-tolerated (Chan et al, 2002; Chandler et al, 2000a). However, the same solution delivered at twice the maintenance rate will not be
as well-tolerated based on human studies (Kuwahara et al, 1998). On the other hand, a solution
with an osmolarity of 1300 mOsmol/L may theoretically be tolerated if delivered at one half of
the normal maintenance rate.
440

6 - Parenteral feeding

> Metabolic complications

Common metabolic complications associated with parenteral nutrition include:
- hyperglycemia
- hyperlipidemia
- Refeeding Syndrome.
Hyperglycemia can be associated with the rapid administration of dextrose containing solutions
that exceed the ability of the pancreas to respond to the hyperglycemia and to secrete appropriate

concentrations of insulin. Avoidance of hyperglycemia is frequently achieved by reducing the rate
of infusion and/or the administration of exogenous insulin .

Critical care

Similarly a state of hyperlipidemia may develop when the patient’s ability to metabolize the delivered fat is exceeded.
The Refeeding Syndrome refers mainly to electrolyte shifts associated with glucose transport into
cells following the reintroduction of food after prolonged anorexia. To minimize most of these
complications careful monitoring and a weaning protocol should be utilized. Should electrolyte
abnormalities occur with refeeding, the authors recommend reducing and/or gradually discontinuing the rate of solution administration, while simultaneously correcting any electrolyte abnormalities. Once the electrolyte abnormalities have resolved, then administration can be resumed
or increased to meet energy requirements.

> Dextrose
Case study: A 20-kg dog whose resting energy requirement equals 70 x
(20)0.75 = 660 kcal/day.
A liter of 5% dextrose solution provides 200 kcal. 3.3 L will therefore
be necessary to cover the dogs daily
RER, which is much greater than the
volume needed to guarantee the
dog’s hydration status and would
most likely result in thrombophlebitis.

> Amino acids

A study did ﬁnd that infusion of a 5% amino acid solution resulted in a mean positive nitrogen
balance in three, healthy dogs (Chandler et al, 2000b). However, the success of this therapeutic
approach in a larger population of dogs in a catabolic state needs to be determined before this
form of nutritional support can be endorsed.
> Fats

MONITORING PROTOCOLS FOR
PARENTERAL FEEDING MUST
INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING
DAILY EVALUATIONS:

- body weight
- temperature
- pulse
- breathing and heart rate
- thoracic auscultation
- catheter position and integrity
- blood glucose concentration and/or
urine glucose every 4 hours during
the weaning on period
- hematocrit and evaluation of
serum for lipemia or jaundice.
- potassium and phosphate in the
12-24 hours following initial
administration
- BUN and albumin concentration
in the 24 hours following initial
administration, and thereafter
every 2-3 days

Critical care

It is common for clinicians to “spike” crystalloids used for ﬂuid therapy with dextrose in an attempt
to provide some nutritional support. Since chronic infusion of greater than 5% is not performed
due to the concern of thrombophlebitis from a hyperosmolar solution, patients only receive
approximately a third of their RER when this solution is administered at maintenance ﬂuid rates.
There is debate regarding the protein-sparing effect that 5% dextrose provides, but limited research has shown that it is not enough to prevent a negative nitrogen balance (Chandler et al, 2000b).

It is also recommended to measure
ionized magnesium concentrations
(where possible) in the 24 hours
following initial administration, and
perform a complete blood count and
biochemical panel every 2-3 days.
Depending on the case, thoracic
radiographs and serum triglyceride
analyses may be of value.

The ideal solution for parenteral administration would be an energy dense solution with a low
osmolarity. Some view lipid emulsions as such an ideal solution. For example, a 20% lipid emulsion can provide 2 kcal/mL with an osmolarity of 268 mOsmol/L. Although the kcal to osmolarity ratio of this solution is ideal, concern exists regarding excessive fat administration. Intravascular fat accumulation has been reported in premature infants with liver dysfunction receiving
lipid emulsions (Levene et al, 1980; Puntis & Rushton, 1991; Toce & Keenan, 1995).
In the limited number of cases where this approach has been used, patients have tolerated solutions providing up to 80% of RER from fat. The safety and efﬁcacy of administering 100% of a
patient’s RER from fat requires further investigation and cannot be recommended at this time.

7 - Complications linked
to enteral or parenteral
feeding
Thrombophlebitis
Hyperosmolar solutions increase the risk of thrombophlebitis. For peripheral vessels, it is recommended that solutions not exceed 600 to 750 mOsmol/L (Chan et al, 2002; Chandler et al, 2000a).
The rate at which milliosmoles (mOsmol) are administered clinically appears to be as crucial as
the osmolarity of the solution. Therefore, a 650 mOsmol solution should not be administered at
twice the maintenance rate for the purpose of increasing the amount of calories delivered to the
patient per unit of time. This limitation results in the need to use parenteral solutions containing
high lipid emulsion concentrations with a high energy to milliosmole ratio, or to provide only a
portion of the patient’s energy requirement. One author reports that using polyurethane catheters
in previously unused vessels for the administration of peripheral parenteral solutions when administrating peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) is well tolerated (Chan et al, 2002).

Septicemia
Parenteral nutrition solutions represent an ideal culture environment for bacteria. To minimize
the infection risk these solutions should be prepared and administered in completely aseptic conditions.

444

Hyperglycemia
There is a growing body of evidence in the human literature that blood glucose clamping with
exogenous insulin of ICU patients may decrease mortality rates. This is due to a reduction in multiple-organ failure secondary to sepsis (van den Berghe, 2002).
The effect appears to be due to the maintenance of euglycemia rather than the beneﬁcial effect
of insulin itself, since in humans increased insulin administration is positively associated with
death (Finney et al, 2003). Hyperglycemia has long been known to decrease immune function due
to adverse effects on polymorphonuclear leukocyte phagocytosis as well as impaired chemotaxis,
phagocytosis and intracellular killing as seen in diabetic subjects (Watters, 2001). This may, in part
explain the lower incidence of sepsis in patients receiving 50% of their RER from PPN in a review
by Chan (2002) compared to the frequency reported in two retrospective TPN studies by Reuter
et al (1998) and Lippert et al (1993). Although patient selection probably plays a key role in the
likelihood of developing septicemia, it is possible that the lower incidence of hyperglycemia associated with the use of PPN was also important.

Once it is in position, the catheter and
the intravenous tubing must be
protected from any risk of
contamination.

Once it is in place the catheter and the tube must be protected from any risk of contamination
by using a dedicated catheter. Medication must not be administered through the dedicated catheter nor should blood be drawn from the dedicated catheter.

Villous atrophy and bacterial translocation
The enterocytes rely heavily on nutrients derived from the gut lumen as energy sources (Ziegler &
Young, 1997). Thus, available energy for enterocytes is diminished with the use of parenteral nutrition. This reduction results in decreased enterocyte health and villous atrophy, and in turn increased intestinal permeability.
The loss of intestinal integrity can increase the risk of gut ﬂora entering the bloodstream; referred
to as bacterial translocation (Steinberg, 2003). There is debate as to when and if this breakdown
occurs, but in humans it usually occurs after a prolonged period of parenteral nutritional support
and may not be as signiﬁcant as rodent models would indicate (Alpers, 2002).
There is also controversy regarding the best method of preventing villous atrophy and bacterial
translocation. While some human and animal studies suggest that infusing glutamine as an energy substrate to prevent villous atrophy and bacterial translocation has some beneﬁt, other studies
have not proven this to be an effective intervention (Buchman, 1999; Marks et al, 1999). In addition, possible contraindications exist, such as liver disease – especially hepatic encephalopathy,
and possibly renal disease.

Adynamic ileus

Critical care

Adynamic ileus is a common sequela of anorexia, especially in patients supported with parenteral nutritional support. Enteral feeding may decrease this risk as hormonal and neurologic signals
are restored by the presence of nutrients in the gut lumen. Adynamic ileus does not always occur,
and in many patients normal peristaltic reﬂexes continue with high pressures being generated
during fasted states (Heddle et al, 1993). This point has implications for patients that have undergone intestinal surgery.
The convention of resting the bowel to prevent leakage through enterostomy sites may be ﬂawed.
There is evidence that early enteral feeding following major abdominal surgery may be preferable
to parenteral support (Braga et al, 1998 & 2002).

445

Conclusion

Conclusion
- Nutritional support is indicated in canine patients with prolonged anorexia, recent body weight
loss unrelated to hydration status, poor body condition and hypoalbuminemia not due to correctable losses.
- Nutritional support can enhance immune function, wound repair, response to therapy, recovery time, and survival.
- Selection of the route and diet for nutritional support should be based on patient tolerance and
prevention of adverse side effects.
- Administration of single macronutrients may not be adequate to meet the patient’s energy and
nutrient requirements and may provide only a limited protein-sparing effect.
- The administration rate of nutritional support should provide the patient’s resting energy requirement without increasing the likelihood of volume intolerance or metabolic complications like
hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and the refeeding syndrome.

Critical care

- Monitoring of patients on nutritional support should be aimed at preventing adverse complications and to ensure successful management.

Diet is an integral part of treatment during the period of hospitalization.
Malnutrition hampers the dog’s recovery from critical illness.

Key Points
to remember:

Critical care nutrition
of dogs

Critical care

• Ideally, a dog should retain a stable
body weight during hospitalization
(or gain weight where appropriate).
Daily weighing is imperative.
Nutritional support will be needed
for a patient with inadequate food
intake (real or foreseen) of 3 days or
more.
• Enteral feeding is by far the best
method of nutritional support: it
avoids atrophy of the intestinal villi
and facilitates faster recovery. When
enteral feeding is impossible, the
length of time that food is withheld
from the intestine must be minimized.

448

• The energy requirement of a hospitalized dog can be compared to that
of a resting dog. Its value is estimated
at no less than 70 kcal/kg (BW)0.75. It
must be understood however that
individual variations can increase this
requirement by 30%.
• The diet’s energy concentration
must be maximized, in order to limit
meal volumes. The higher the fat
content the greater the energy density. Administration of 30-50% of the
calories as fat should be the aim. The
ideal solution is a diet that has a combination of high energy density and
is easy to suspend in water.

• The protein content should be sufﬁcient to maintain a positive nitrogen balance. Provision of 30-50% of
total calories from protein helps combat loss of lean body mass.
• Be aware that a solution with a
high glucose content may promote
hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia.
Do not exceed 10-25% of total calories as glucose.
• The ﬂuid-electrolytic balance must
be monitored very closely in critically
ill dogs: blood potassium, phosphorus and magnesium concentrations
are especially important. Rehydration
solutions help correct some electrolyte deﬁciencies.

The social role of food
and behavioral pathologies
in the dog
Gérard MULLER
DVM, Dipl ECVB-CA
A qualified veterinarian educated at the National Veterinary School of Maisons-Alfort (France), from which he graduated in 1982,
Gérard Muller has been a local medical practitioner since 1985 and vice-president of Zoopsy (international defense group of
the French animal psychiatry school) since 1998. He was awarded his diploma as a Veterinary Schools Behaviorist and now teaches the
subject. Gérard is also a Charter Diplomate of the European College of Veterinary Behaviorists for Companion Animals (ECVB-CA).

T

Behavior

he feeding behavior of dogs often includes anecdotal evidence
or haphazard interpretations. The management of resources,
and specifically food, is fundamental in animal societies.
Frequently, access to food is ritualized, requiring well developed
communication, once the essential needs are covered.
In human societies, when food is abundant, meal access and
eating have a social value. This ritualization causes the members
of the group to consume the food (or at least to adopt the associated
behaviors) for reasons other than hunger. Our domesticated
dogs are placed in an identical situation as most of them have
sufficient food. The management of their food is therefore more
often guided by the needs of communication than by hunger.
Humans and dogs share a number of common points when
it comes to communication around food. However, the minor
differences are the cause of serious misunderstandings that leads
to education problems, dietary disorders and even pathological
conditions. It is also conceivable that, beyond their specific
characteristics, some diseases or pathological conditions
will lead to disruptions in dietary behavior.
Practitioners who observe a dysregulation in food intake
must evaluate the type of dysregulation and expect to
encounter effects in both communication and behavior.

A pack of wolves.
In canid societies, the dominant
animals control access to the whole
group’s food supply. The other animals
eat very quickly, because access to the
food may be refused at any time.

1 - Social role of food in canine societies
Just like many social species that live in hierarchical groups, for dogs access to food
resources is based on a precise chain that reflects the hierarchy. The alpha animals
that control reproduction have primary access to food resources. This hierarchy means
that the resources are reserved for the strongest animals and this results in the selection of the most influential genes (Goldberg, 1998).

A ritual is a behavioral sequence
that has lost its initial function,
used as a means of communication
in a social group. The use of a ritual
binds and soothes the group
(Heymer, 1977).

The rules established in a given group are maintained and constantly reinforced by
the application of rituals that replace and so prevent energy-sapping confrontations.
There is usually a shift between objective and symbolic, as privileges gradually become a symbol of power. In dogs, the control of the food is a symbol of a high hierarchical position, even when the supply is abundant.

Domesticated dogs exhibit many of the behaviors that are undoubtedly motivated by
the need to impose periods of ‘respectful’ observation on the master when the dog eats.
For example, difficult dogs often love to attract attention when they eat.

Yorkshire Terrier
Small dogs live more easily in contact with their
master (in laps and chairs, etc). As a result,
they are more exposed to bad education and
dietary errors.
Behavior

Besides control of the food, which acquires a ritual function for hierarchization, the
behaviors allowing one animal to eat before the others, while others wait and watch,
also have a social significance. It is clear that the dominant (alpha) members not only
take the best food first, but that they also oblige others to attend the meal and patiently wait their turn (Muller, 1998a).

© Y. Lanceau

It is therefore conceivable that the dog produces a certain number of behaviors aimed
at controlling the food in the group without the involvement of appetite or hunger in
the determination of these behaviors (Scott et al, 1965; Fox, 1978). So, a dog that begs
at the table may be doing so not for taste or hunger reasons, but to show that it has
access to the group’s resources (in the representative sense).

453

2 - Social role of food in human societies

2 - Social role of food in human societies
Managed in the same way as hierarchical animal societies, in highly industrial societies food is also used as a loaded symbol to express notions of equality. The principle is
the same as above, but its expression is reversed. Inviting someone to your table is a sign
of friendship. This perception should not be misconstrued, it is driven by the same fundamental characteristics as dietary hierarchization in the dog. In the soldiers mess for
example, diners are separated according to their rank. At wedding banquets, the seating
plan is very important. Placements at the table usually respect hierarchical precedence.
Just witness the embarrassment when a group of people sit down to eat after a work meeting when there is no seating plan.
On the other hand, it is good manners for employers to share a drink or a bite to eat with
their employees to make it clear that there is not a huge social barrier.
In humans as in dogs, feeding has been ritualized to become a symbol of power or social
glue.
Gifts are also a means of power. The person that receives is in debt and the acceptance
of a gift is a gesture that can have great social significance. What woman would accept
flowers or jewelry from just anyone who offered it, without feeling embarrassed? The gift
binds the person who accepts it. One of the ways to possess the animal is to offer it a gift.
The gift of food is often the scourge of zoo keepers who are unable to dissuade visitors
from trying to give food to the animals they like. For animals, the gift is inevitably food
and the stakes are non-acceptance.

3 - Social role of food in the
relationships between humans
and dogs

Young German shepherd
after weaning
Dietary ritualization starts at the end of
the suckling period and is achieved
around the 16th week.

Two factors are intertwined: the necessity of ritualizing the relationships (humans and dogs are social animals) and the need to control
this relationship (principally through food). Ignorance of canine ethology and communication often leads owners to content themselves
with anthropomorphical interpretations that result in serious aberrations.
The misunderstanding is often established in the first moments of the
relationship (the first weeks after adoption), as the master looks to win
the dog’s affection with gifts of food. In this case the dog will gain the
wrong impression of the new family if its development up until that
time, has been normal. More seriously, if this attitude is adopted too
early in the life of the puppy it may thwart harmonious development by stifling the essential social constraints of self-control in social species (Moorcroft, 1981).
Habits are formed quickly. The master tries to give pleasure to the dog by satisfying its
various demands for food, while the dog tries to acquire the highest possible social status.

Behavior

The social relationship is gradually reduced to these exchanges of food, which allow
owners to exonerate themselves from their various breaches. Inviting the dog to the table
is a mark of social esteem and a way to win the animal’s heart. Gradually, habit will trans454

3 - Social role of food in the relationships between humans and dogs

form the gift of food into a ritual. Besides bad behavior in the relationship, these practices also lead to eating disorders. For these reasons the dog will become difficult and
greedy. This is exacerbated when the dog’s relationship with its master is based on the
ritualized gift of food, which makes change more difficult for both the master and the
dog. The notion of guilt plays a large part in this giving of food. The more a master thinks
the dog is unhappy the more important he or she will find it to compensate with the gift
of food (Muller, 1998b).
TABLE 1 - SEVEN HELPFUL TIPS FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE PUPPY
1. Do not change the food the first day the puppy arrives, and only make food available to the puppy for brief
intervals: five times a day for five minutes would appear sufficient. Do not linger while the puppy is eating.
Subsequently, it is preferable to offer meals for a brief period (five minutes) at regular times. The ideal number
of meals for a weaning puppy is five daily and for an adult dog it is two daily.
2. From day one, do not allow your dog to approach the table during your own mealtimes, whatever its age. This
rule must never be broken. Remember that breakfast is also a meal.
3. Select kibbles in a rational way, without succumbing to impulse buying. Any changes should be transitional.
Do not trust in the preferences of your dog or cat, which are based on flavor and are not always best for the
animal’s health.
4. Use small pieces of food as a reward after exercise, but ensure that these treats correspond to an effort
made or a command learned.
5. Give the dog its meal after you have had your own or at completely different times.
6. Leave the room when the dog is eating. Do not try to take the bowl, as this will provoke a conflict and you
cannot be sure that you will come out on top even if you do get the bowl.
7. Contrary to the popular belief, bones do not provide the dog with much in the way of nutrients. It is
preferable to give the dog chewing bars. Leave the dog in peace when it is busy with its treat.

Behavior

You should only give food over and
above meals as a reward to help the
dog to learn. This means you should
give the treat at the end of the sequence
of commands you want to reinforce to
the dog. Remember you can easily
substitute a few kind words or a few
pats instead of a treat.

3 - Social role of food in the relationships between humans and dogs

A system of random rewards is recommended to attain a certain type of behavior through training. At first, the desired behavior should be encouraged and reinforced with systematic
rewards. When the animal regularly starts to produce the required sequence, the reward may
be alternated (once in every two then every three times). After a period of time, it is a good
idea to progress to random rewards, which will attain the desired behavior and ensure that it
does not disappear when it is no longer reinforced.
Owners inadvertently teach their dogs that they can beg at the table by employing the alternative reward, then stopping providing a reward almost totally, so adopting a random reward
model. It is normal for the dog to beg in these circumstances, even when the owner practically never succumbs (Lorenz, 1978).

TABLE 2 - TEN ERRORS TO AVOID
1. Giving food from the table: by sharing food you destroy the dog’s image of you. The dog admires and feels an
attachment to masters that protect their food.
2. Imploring your dog to eat or encouraging it by feeding it with your hand. If you want your dog to respect you,
you should not stay in its company when it is eating. By showing that you really want it to eat, you assume a
subordinate position and invite the dog to refuse food in its desire to move up the hierarchy.

3. Confusing a good diet with being nice. This may hold for humans, but it does not hold for dogs. A happy dog is
a healthy dog that can go for a walk and play with its master. Food should be used only to quell hunger, not as
a way of gaining affection. Animals are not capable of managing dietary pleasure in any reasonable way.
4. Do not feed your dog just before you sit down to eat yourself to stop it begging. This will confuse the dog,
which will certainly not beg because it is hungry but because it wants to take on the status of master by sharing
your food.
5. Giving your puppy different foods to make it feel at ease when it first arrives. The first days in a new home are
decisive. It is normal to try to reproduce an environment the puppy understands. You should not modify the
image it has of adult humans. It is normal that it does not dare eat when it arrives and exhibits timid behavior.
It is also important to impose rules from the beginning.
6. Using small treats to stimulate the dog’s appetite for its kibble. There is no point in doing this. If the dog is
hungry it will eat its kibble. Otherwise there is a risk of making it eat when it is not hungry, which will cause
unwanted weight gain. In addition if you continue with this ritual you increase the risk of the dog not accepting
its kibbles.
7. Making up for your absences and shortcomings with food treats. There is a risk you will reduce the dog-master
relationship to an exchange of food.
8. Reducing the quantity of food and drink for reasons of cleanliness. This common technique puts the master’s
desires ahead of the dog’s needs. Young puppies must be given at least four meals a day and they must have
access to fresh water at all times. There is a risk that irregular distribution will lead to digestive disorders that
adversely affect learning.
9. Not worrying about a puppy that eats a lot more than the manufacturer’s recommendations. Over consumption
can be a sign of satiation, behavioral (hypersensibility-hyperactivity) or digestion problems. It would appear wise
not to wait long before discussing it with the veterinarian.

Behavior

10. Giving a homemade meal once a week. This expresses the master’s lack of confidence in a prepared petfood.
The master either fears some deficiency or is afraid that the dog will not be happy. Serious discussions with the
owner must be used to show the dietary quality of manufactured food.

456

4 - Behavioral pathology and food

Practitioners must be aware of these points if they are to eliminate bad habits. A ritual
cannot be eradicated without compensation. On the other hand, no guilt should be attributed, as this will involuntarily strengthen the attitude that triggers the gift of food
(Tables 1 & 2).

4 - Behavioral pathology and food
Relational problems

© Renner

The concept of dietary behavior ritualization enables us to understand the development of relationships in relation to food for the domesticated dog. The
ritual must be understood as an essential part of the dog’s relationship with
the master. To retain contact with our remote friends and acquaintances, at
least once a year we succumb to the ritual of sending a greeting card.
The prevalence of rituals increases when the master-dog relationship is
weakened and the dog will spontaneously initiate symbolic behavioral
sequences. At a certain level, this increase becomes pathological attentionseeking behavior (Overall, 1997).
Dietary rituals are clearly involved and the animal may adopt dietary behavior that is
contrary to its primary needs (hunger and satiation). The animal may eat even though
it is satiated to show its position or to accomplish a ritual act. On the other hand, it
may refuse to eat if the circumstances no longer correspond to a ritualized act (Houpt,
1991). These behaviors are governed by strong motivations and are not easy to change. Denouncing them will not be enough to eliminate them. They express the deep
unease of the dog, the master and their relationship (Beaumont et al, 2003).

Bulimic behavior in a dog may
be an expression of anxiety.
Eating may have become a
displacement activity.

Anxiety and displacement activity

Unfortunately, such automatic excessive behaviors (stereotypes) lose
their primary function and especially their comforting power. Only a
considerable increase in number can compensate for the loss of this function. The ritualized sequence gradually becomes displacement activity.
If feeding is part of the behavior adopted by the dog to regain a calm attitude, disproportional ingestion and a spectacular weight gain can be expected.

© Bouschka

The animal may become anxious due to relational problems or other reasons. The condition will lead the dog to want to be assuaged more than
a normal animal and it will seek to maximize its contacts with its owners
(it may be impossible to leave the dog alone). The need for contact
(secondary hyper-attachment) may leave the animal unable to feed itself
if its masters are no longer present (it will eventually die of starvation).
Furthermore, an anxious animal will attempt to regain its emotional stability through repetitive rituals ad infinitum.

An active Golden Retriever
Recreational therapy is part of the
treatment of dietary behavior problems.
The goal is to increase exploration
activity to create a positive emotional
context.

Behavior

Such behavior cannot be eliminated without specific etiological treatment (antidepressant and restoration of a socially-adapted environment).

457

4 - Behavioral pathology and food

Sick animals
Owners often tend to wrongly interpret their animal’s lack of appetite as a sign of developing illness and encourage the dog to eat even though it is in good health.
It is true that a sick animal – especially one with a fever – will typically lose its appetite. This behavior has been described as an adaptive response (Hart, 1990 & 1991).
Interleukin will play a role in the sick animal’s demotivated behavior (Dantzer, 1999).
Conversely, it is not sufficient to explain a clear lack of motivation to eat without a
visible organic cause by saying that the disease is behavioral. Such a default diagnostic often leads to unproductive treatments.

Satiation problems
The dog’s relationship with its owner is not the source of all behavioral diseases. Some
dogs are abnormally adapted or may even be suffering from an illness. Some of these
conditions are expressed through satiation problems.
> Two-phase hypersensibility-hyperactivity syndrome (HSHA)

In the worst cases, hypersensibility-hyperactivity or a lack of self-control is accompanied by a lack of satiation. The animal becomes unable to adapt its behavior to the
internal messages it receives. The sight of food triggers feeding and the sight of water
triggers drinking. The dog only stops when he is
incapable of continuing or when a more inspiring
event attracts its attention (Pageat, 1995).

© Psaila

These dogs are seldom obese, because they expend
more energy than healthy dogs. They are often
insomniacs and their hypersensitivity leads them
to react to stimulation with great energy. Their
dietary needs are generally not at all consistent
with the recommendations of manufacturers of
commercial foods, which are not geared to such
energy expenditure.

Knowing that such behavioral
disorders exists can help the
practitioner to show greater
patience in helping to deal with
the difficult issues.

This disorder rarely resolves without treatment.
Anxiety ultimately develops, modifying the initial
clinical presentation (Dehasse, 1996). These animals have difficulties learning. It is fairly uncommon for dietary rituals to be established in the master-dog relationship here.
> Primary and secondary
dissocialization

Dissocialization is the result of bad developmental conditions (Muller, 2000). This disorder can be primary when it is the consequence of major initial deficiencies and it can
be secondary when it is due to unfavorable early and late conditions (Arpaillange, 2000).

Behavior

Patients present various symptoms, which boil down to a poor or even non-existent
knowledge of canine social rules. For these dogs, of course, dietary rituals are absent
or frustrating. The desired food is consumed and every obstacle against satisfying this
craving is fought against. These dogs are sometimes capable of jumping on the table
to steal their master’s plate. This condition has a wide spectrum of severity, from very
poor education to the most violent psychotic behavior.

458

Conclusion

> Depression

Emotional problems can sometimes bring about mood disorders. The best known is
depression, which can be acute or chronic in dogs. The distinction between these two
forms is centered on appetite and sleep. There would appear to be a correlation between the two.
In a chronic depression, sleep increases while feeding decreases (Habran, 1998). An irregular appetite may be the first sign of this chronic form.
The acute form is more alarming: the dog stops eating and sleeps excessively. In puppies it represents
an emergency.

Conclusion
The study of dietary behavior goes well beyond the confines of nutrition. Conversely,
you cannot hope to come to grips with canine nutrition without a good knowledge of
the psychological value of food and meals, for both humans and dogs.
Clinicians that deal with problems of dietary behavior must consider the elements of
behavior to be symptoms of disease. The consultation is used to identify the food-related symptoms and other components to arrive at a systematic description of the disease.
The prescription depends on the disease, and incorporates every etiological aspect of
it. An exclusively symptomatic prescription will not have the same impact. If it is to
be effective, nutrition alone can target only some of the problems of dietary behavior
and the prescription must include all psychological and organic aspects.

The palatability of a food depends on how
the dog consumes it, as this translates
its perception of the food’s organoleptic
qualities. A highly palatable food will be
consumed with great pleasure, while
an unpalatable food may be
underconsumed or even refused.

Key Points
in the analysis of:

The dietary behavior sequence
Generally speaking, food intake
follows the following sequence.

© UMES

The search, identification
and selection phases
The dog uses its sense of smell to
capture the aromas emitted by the
food and its sense of touch to
judge the food’s
temperature.
Smell is the most
discriminating
sense in this
phase. The dog
has 70-200 million
olfactory
receptors, compared with a
human’s 5 to 20 million receptors
(Vadurel & Gogny, 1997).

Behavior

When a dog sniffs, the airflow is 1 l
/sec, which is ten times faster than
in normal respiration (Vadurel &
Gogny, 1997). Olfactory acuity is at a

460

maximum when the dog is hungry
and falls when the dog is satiated.

that wild canids also eat fruits and
berries.

The sense of smell declines with
age.

Conditioning starts before birth, as
the puppy’s gustative system starts
to function just before whelping
(Ferrel, 1984). It is sensitive to certain
molecules in the mother’s food,
which are conveyed through the
placental circulation and the
amniotic liquid (Thorne, 1995). This
intrauterine exposure influences
the future preferences of the
puppy (Doty, 1986).

The oral phase
The dog now perceives the size,
shape, texture and taste of the
food.
The sense of taste is centered in
the gustatory papilla on the
tongue, palate and pharynx. Dogs
have around 1700 tastebuds, compared with 9000 tastebuds in
humans.
Dogs distinguish five distinct flavors: bitter, sweet, acidic, salty and
umami, which is the recognition of
an essential amino acid, glutamate. Dogs tend to reject bitter flavors and be attracted to sweet flavors. It should be remembered

Digestion phase
If the dog associates negative sensations with the ingestion of a
food (e.g. if it is ill just after it has
eaten), it may develop a process of
aversion that will lead it to avoid
this food the next time (Cheney &
Miller, 1997).

Focus on:

FOOD FLAVORS
The dog is naturally attracted to
food with a high fat content.
Increasing the quantity of fat in
the kibble’s coating is the simplest
way of increasing palpability,
although this strategy may be
counterproductive to the nutritional strategy. There is a danger that
high fat food will encourage obesity if the owner fails to properly
control the quantities given.

The more you try to limit the fat
content, the more important flavor is to palatability. Flavors were
limited until new ones started to
be produced by traditional
methods like enzyme hydrolysis
and Maillard reactions, as used in
the manufacture of cookies. A
technological breakthrough has
enabled the development of a
third generation of flavors, with

even better results. The effect is
much improved as it is the synergy
of the two flavor types that were
formerly used for dogs.
The work on flavors involves following their development in time.
Palatability must remain satisfying
until the final date of consumption
stated on the packaging.

THE MAIN TECHNOLOGIES USED UN DEVELOPING FLAVORS
1. Maillard reactions are used to flavor
various products (coffee, rusks, roasted
meat, etc).

2. Hydrolyzates are often obtained from heated and acidified
poultry proteins. Enzymes are used to produce protein
autolysis.

Clinical practice

n the past, when veterinary medical knowledge was limited,
husbandry issues including diet were the predominant focus
for patient care. As new diseases were described, nutritional
issues did not become any less vital to successful patient care,
but their importance was slowly diluted by the sea of new
diagnostics and therapeutics that became available to
veterinary medicine. Fortunately, our knowledge of nutrition
has not remained static as the rest of veterinary medicine
has advanced, and thus, the wisdom of integrating diet
into a patient’s therapeutic management has been proven
in a growing number of disease states. Given the importance
of nutrition in veterinary medicine, the goal of this chapter
is to illustrate how nutrition can be successfully integrated
into any clinical practice.

462

Size is not necessarily related to the type of activity; some of
the recommendations in this chapter for a RP may be more
appropriate for a PCP with a large number of veterinarians.
However, this assumption may not hold across all practices,
and therefore the reader is encouraged to review and consider all of the following recommendations.

1 - Maximizing space

© A. Fliek

Veterinary medicine is transitioning into a two tier system
of providing medical care. The first tier in this system is the
primary care provider (PCP). The second tier in the system
is the referral practice (RP). In addition, it is assumed that
a RP inherently sees more complex and refractory cases as a
percentage of its caseload.

Netherlands.

Below, from top to bottom:
- Veterinary caduceus of United States
- Veterinary caduceus of South Africa
- Veterinary caduceus of Germany.

Regardless of practice type or size, there is an inherent need to dedicate space to nutrition.
The ability to store and provide more dietary options is somewhat dependent on the quantity of space that a practice allocates for that purpose. Since a significant percentage of a
practice’s earnings are frequently from food sales, this allocation of space is most likely economically justified. As there are always limitations on the amount of space available, the
following section discusses strategies to maximize available space and recommends the minimum inventory necessary to treat the majority of cases.

1 - Maximizing space
If space is limited, the amount of stock on hand will inherently need to be limited. A small inventory demands either one of two management strategies – frequent delivery or limited sales.
Clearly, limiting sales either intentionally or unintentionally is less than desirable. Limited sales
can frequently mean that the importance of nutritional management in patient care is under-recognized. This can have a deleterious effect on both patient and practice health.
Orders cannot be placed once a week or month, but rather may need to be made daily in order to
prevent prohibitively long delays in providing patients or clients with needed diet. Inevitably,
there is a cost associated with having a small inventory. The cost of a small inventory may not be
realized if the only cost recognized is the expense associated with the additional square footage
and not lost sales or increased labor costs.

Every veterinary practice is different
whether that be due to geographic,
socioeconomic or practice style
differences. Therefore, any guideline
that is created cannot anticipate every
specific need that a particular practice
may have. However, certain
significant differences between
practices are likely to be universal
based on practice size and type.

A large inventory allows a practice the luxury of having infrequent deliveries and/or
high diet demand. This system allows the workload to reduce due to frequent ordering. The downside to this is the added space that such an inventory requires.

Managing incoming stock

© Renner

Several companies have developed control systems that allow product sales to
be tracked in addition to assisting with inventory management. This type of
sales data allows the practice manager to better assess the practice’s needs and
to stock a practice-specific diet inventory. Whatever management tool is used,
it is necessary to decide:
- the quality offer available to clients;
- the minimum volume to be stocked for each reference.

463

Clinical practice

A practice that deals with many obese patients
may wish to carry a higher percentage of diets
designed for weight loss than a practice that
focuses on oncology.

1 - Maximizing space

> Selecting available products

In an effort to address space limitations a priority should be placed on stocking diets that are used
frequently. Diet selection should be based on disease prevalence and the proven importance of
nutrition in disease prevention and treatment (Table 1).

The list of therapeutic diets should meet the canine dietary needs of most practices.
Other diets are available for growth and maintenance, degenerative joint disease support, hepatic and cardiac disease support that are not listed in the table, but may be useful depending upon
the practice preferences and demographics.
Although a single commercial diet for each category above may be adequate for the majority of
patients, there are times when palatability, learned aversions or other qualities will necessitate the
use of a diet that is not in stock. To facilitate identifying diets that may serve as adequate surrogates, practices should keep up-to-date product guides for all available manufacturers. These product guides can also serve as references for nutrient data for patients with extensive diet histories.

Clinical practice

Almost all patients can be managed through the use of commercial diets; however, a small subset
of patients may require specially formulated, home-cooked diets. In these cases special training in
veterinary nutrition is recommended to ensure all situations can be handled correctly.

464

An order must be triggered when the stock reaches a
minimum threshold. The quantity to be ordered
depends on the quantity of products that can be put on
the shelves. For various references, it is also important
to take into account the potential growth of the sales.

Storage

© M. Lechardoy. Avec l’aimable autorisation de T. Hazan.

The minimum inventory is equal to the quantity
that will theoretically be sold between the order
date and the delivery date. If orders are made daily
and the delivery time is 24 hours, the minimum
inventory must constitute 1/6 of weekly sales. This
inventory can of course be supplemented by a safety margin to offset a delay in delivery or increased
consumption for a limited period.

1 - Maximizing space

> Keeping inventory at a minimum

Consistent product usage has the benefit of allowing product performance for a
particular disease state to be determined and adjustments in recommendations to
be made when indicated. Usage that is too inconsistent may limit the practitioner’s
ability to recognize a product’s effectiveness.

> Retail space

Stock must be arranged neatly, separate from the storage zone (Figure 1) and as clearly as
possible for the client. Arrange according to species (with a visual for fast identification),

Large packs mean you have to have a lot of space between shelves. Since the number of diets that
a practice wishes to stock will often exceed the amount of available space, stocking smaller sized

bags can allow for increased storage. Using small bags for dietary trials allows the hospital to need
less space for food storage and a larger bag can be subsequently special-ordered when the diet’s
palatability and performance has been proven. Moreover, due to the decreased mass of smaller
bags, higher (and easier) shelving can be employed, increasing storage capacity.

Frequent replenishment will facilitate
a rapid response to the request
of owners, but will increase the
workload for staff.

> The storage zone itself

There are four must-dos to use the storage zone optimally:
- Space optimization: reduce the distance between shelves by laying large packs flat;
- Product accessibility: label the shelves to make products easier to find. Large bags should be nearest to the ground.
- Respect storage conditions: products must be kept dry and must not be subjected to extreme temperatures or humidity
- Respect expiration dates: new stock should be placed behind older stock on the shelves.

Managing outgoing stock
Outgoing stock should normally trigger three actions:
- Billing and payment or charging
- Stock is updated automatically by the computer system
- A new order to replenish the stock at required levels.

Space dedicated solely for diet preparation is vital to facilitating the application of nutrition in
clinical practice. This area can be as simple as a small counter to allow cans to be opened and
bowls to be filled, along with an adjacent sink equipped with a garbage disposal. A few additional items can increase the efficiency of a food preparation/kitchen area. A brief list of items
that all practices should consider is provided in Table 2.

Choice of diet
A fundamental question in the management of every hospitalized patient is whether to feed or
not. If the answer is to feed the patient, the next decision concerns the route of administration
and the type of food. This topic is explored further in Chapter 14; however, the subject will be
discussed as it relates to the logistics of providing nutritional services to the client and patient.
As a policy, clients should be encouraged and instructed to bring the patient’s typical diet for
feeding during hospitalization. Clearly there are exceptions which should be considered based
on the underlying disease and the reason for hospitalization. However, when practical and not
contraindicated, feeding the patient’s own diet should minimize any potential gastrointestinal
distress that may occur due to sudden dietary changes.
When the patient’s typical diet is not available, another diet will have to be selected. Highly
digestible diets are usually well accepted and tolerated; however, care should be taken to ensure that the diet is not concurrently too high in fat. Although fat can increase palatability and
the likelihood of acceptance, it is the experience of the authors that sudden increases in dietary fat appear to be one of the most consistent and least recognized causes of gastrointestinal distress. In addition, although diets higher in moisture are often found to be more palatable, this

2 - Feeding hospitalized patients

is not always the case and the patient may have a texture preference for dry food and will reject
diets higher in moisture. Therefore, a highly digestible and low fat diet may be the best food to
use as a standard hospitalized diet and should be stocked in an amount to meet this need.
> Meeting a hospitalized patient’s energy needs

For many hospitalized patients, voluntary consumption of food will adequately meet a patient’s
energy needs. However, nutritional support may become necessary and, thus, should be an available procedure at all practices. A variety of enteral feeding tubes to meet diverse patient needs
can be placed without special equipment beyond the appropriate feeding tubes and diet (i.e.
nasoesophageal, esophagostomy or jejunostomy feeding tubes).
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes require the use of more expensive and
advanced equipment, but all practices should be able to provide adequate nutritional support
to their patients without the use of an endoscope.
The use of parenteral nutrition may not be practical at many clinics and, thus, may be limited
to RPs. However, as peripherally administered parenteral nutrition solutions with lower osmolarity and higher energy density become more common place and more proven, the use of parenteral nutrition may be more widely used in the future. For further discussion on critical care
nutritional support please see Chapter 14.

HOW TO ENSURE OWNER COMPLIANCE AFTER A DIET PRESCRIPTION IN DOGS
-

The veterinarian’s lack of confidence in their own recommendations
The possibility that the client may not clearly understand the benefits
of the recommendation.

There are steps that we can take to increase compliance when it comes to
ensuring that our clients follow a recommendation to use a therapeutic diet:
1. Ensure that you and your staff have confidence in your
recommendations.
2. Create understanding and shared expectations through client
communication and education.
3. Make the solution easy.
4. Continuous communication.
Compliance with respect to a diet prescription begins with the veterinarian
and their staff. When there is a universal understanding and consistency with
regard to ensuring client compliance, the patient, client and your veterinary
practice all benefit.

Clinical practice

A recent study commissioned by the American Animal Hospital
Association (AAHA) reviewed client compliance in a variety of clinical
areas, including the use of veterinary therapeutic diets. More than
350 veterinary practices throughout the United States participated
through interviews and medical record reviews. The goals were to
determine compliance levels, identify opportunities to provide better
health care for pets through compliance, understand the barriers to
compliance and lastly, how to promote compliance.
The report determined that 27% of pets with a medical condition that
would have benefited from a therapeutic diet did not receive or follow
such a recommendation from the veterinary provider. These findings
equated to 11.6 million dogs with one of six diagnosed conditions that
could have been helped by the use of a prescription diet that were not
fed a therapeutic diet at all, or were not fed a therapeutic diet for an
appropriate amount of time.
There are a number of factors that may contribute to a reduction in
compliance when it comes to the use of therapeutic diets in our patients:
- The veterinarian’s misconceptions about the client’s willingness to act
- Cost of the diet
- Convenience
- Willingness of the pet to eat the food
- The owner’s nutritional philosophies

3 - Advice on diets

3 - Advice on diets
Nutritional advice at every appointment
At the very least, a diet history should be collected and a brief discussion of the patient’s performance on its current diet should be completed at every appointment. A diet history must be detailed enough that the patient could be fed the correct diet and amount with the recorded information.
The veterinarian should strive for a diet history that would enable tracking of every calorie
consumed by the patient (i.e. main diet, secondary diets, dog treats, human treats, etc.), but
often this level of detail is reserved for patients that have undergone unintentional weight
loss or gain. The use of a standardized form (Table 3) may prove useful in collecting detailed and accurate information on a patient’s diet. Having a form available for clients to take

home enables them to complete the diet history at home where the specific diet name and
amount can be more readily determined. The form also can easily be filed into the patient’s
medical record for later review and comparison. It has been the experience of the authors
that such forms elicit more truthful and complete answers than simply questioning the
client.

Commercial diet recommendations
Every veterinarian should feel comfortable making recommendations to clients regarding commercial diets for healthy patients. As veterinarians focus more on preventative medicine, dietary
recommendations will play a more important role in every patient’s overall wellness plan. When
recommending a diet, two important aspects to consider are nutritional adequacy and the ability of the diet to maintain the patient in an appropriate body condition.
Nutritional adequacy is constantly evolving as nutrient requirements are defined and refined. In
the U.S., the non-profit organization, Association of American Feed Control Officials
(AAFCO), has developed testing protocols and nutrient profiles in an effort to ensure nutritional adequacy of animal feeds including commercial pet foods. Diets that have undergone feeding trials are often preferred since they may provide better evidence that a diet’s nutrients are
available. In comparison, diets that simply meet nutrient profiles have not established that their
nutrients are available and, thus, may not perform as anticipated based solely on recommendations.

The veterinarian’s product range must
be split into three distinct groups:
Health Nutrition (for healthy animals),
Feed & Secure Nutrition (to address
specific risks) and Clinical Nutrition,
to support the treatment of some
pathologies.

Ideally, all food producers should have feeding test results for the food they are selling. Product
quality also depends on the producer’s vigilance with respect to the raw ingredients used and
the end products sold.

469

Clinical practice

One approach to help ensure the likelihood that a particular product is nutritionally adequate is
to recommend feeding commercial diets that have a long-term history of use. Smaller companies
often lack the same level of experience and expertise in diet formulation, employ few, if any, fulltime nutritionists, and rarely have active research and development programs. Larger companies
have many more “sentinels” for potential diet problems due to the increased number of dogs fed
their products. Thus, if problems do arise, they are less likely to be missed or overlooked as an isolated incident.

3 - Advice on diets

The only intervention proven to delay the onset of disease and extend lifespan is maintenance
of an optimal body condition (Kealy & al, 2002). Therefore, it is important that each client be
counseled on the importance and health benefits of maintaining a lean body condition in their
pet. It is also important to remember that in every feeding equation there are three major factors that affect the final outcome; the animal, the diet and the husbandry/environmental conditions in which the animal is maintained. Therefore, the ability of the client to use a diet to
maintain a lean body condition in their pet is an important indicator of how that diet performs
in any given situation. In many instances, diets designed for maintenance or all life stages can
be used successfully. However, sometimes a diet that is less energy dense may be necessary. At
the same time, a less energy dense diet should have increased concentrations of all nutrients
per unit of energy, as the delivery of nutrients may be artificially limited when fed to maintain
a lean body condition.

Nutritional supplements
The act of selecting a diet that is nutritionally adequate should negate the need for additional
supplementation. Veterinary medicine suffers from anthropomorphism in many areas, and one
of the most extensive areas where this occurs is nutritional supplementation. Clients are inundated by the media and the human medical community about the beneficial effects of increasing their own intake of selected nutrients. Many of these beneficial effects would be blunted
or lost if the daily diet of the client was as balanced as their pet’s commercial food. Unfortunately, this point is often lost on clients and the perception that additional supplementation is in
the best interest of their pet continues. This perception is difficult to counter, especially when
supplementation is seen as innocuous and only beneficial. This is clearly not the case, and the
client may need to be educated on the potential risk of adding nutrients into an already complete and balanced diet.
Beyond education, the veterinarian should provide guidance regarding the proven efficacy of
the product. Efficacy studies rarely exist in the veterinary literature. Any research that has been
done is often not in vivo studies, but rather in vitro work where the concentrations used exceed
the amount physiologically possible. Alternatively, the amount of the nutrient being supplemented is quite possibly a fraction of the amount already in the diet and thus of little additional benefit. Clients’ energies and finances may be better spent on the selection and purchase of
a complete and balanced maintenance diet that maintains optimal body condition. Additional
supplementation of any nutrient should only be advised in conditions where an increased requirement has been shown and where the amount provided in the diet is known in order to avoid
dietary excesses. If a diet is found to be low in a particular nutrient, selection of an alternative
diet with appropriate levels of the nutrient in question is a more prudent course of action rather
than supplementation.
An all-meat diet is imbalanced and
especially leads to calcium deficiency.

Home prepared diets
Some clients choose to prepare food at home out of a concern that commercial pet foods are not as wholesome or nutritious as a diet they make themselves. Others have allowed their dogs to develop a fixed-food preference,
usually based around home-cooked ingredients. Some clients are required to
prepare their dog’s meals out of medical necessity. Some dogs have multiple
concurrent disease states, which cannot be managed using a commercially
available pet food.

Clinical practice

Whatever the underlying cause, all of these clients are equally at risk of feeding a diet that is inappropriate, incomplete or unbalanced. Although these
diets are unlikely to cause a problem in the short term (2-3 months), there is
a risk of clinical signs developing over the long term in the healthy adult and

470

4 - Dietary training

most likely sooner in the growing or unhealthy dog. Evaluation of the client’s home prepared
diet should be offered and recommended.
Initiating a successful consultation with a board-certified nutritionist usually requires that a
very detailed and accurate diet and medical history be provided, along with the patient’s current weight and body condition score, as well as the client’s goals and concerns regarding
the patient’s diet. For puppies, the owner should be encouraged to regularly update the
weight gain curve.
If specific, but uncommon ingredients (for which little nutrient data is known) are utilized by
the client, determining their willingness to change the ingredient or their reason for using the
ingredient can be very useful. It can be quite difficult to determine the overall caloric distribution, let alone specific nutrient concentrations, by simply looking at the ingredients. However,
the veterinarian should feel comfortable identifying simple and obvious nutrient deficiencies in
home prepared diets.
The following items should be identifiable in every home prepared diet:
• Protein source – usually from an animal or a concentrated vegetable protein (i.e. tofu);

Proteins are composed of twenty
or so amino acids, only half of
which are indispensable to the
dog and must be provided
in the food.

Essential fats are polyunsaturated
fatty acids. They are more sensitive
to oxidation and must therefore be
stored with care.

• Essential fatty acids – especially linoleic acid – animal-source proteins rarely provide adequate
levels of this fatty acid, thus a vegetable oil should be included;
• Calcium and phosphorus – these minerals are required in high concentrations and therefore are
often provided in the form of bone meal or a calcium supplement;
• Other minerals and vitamins – unless liver or whole egg is provided in relatively high amounts,
a source of other minerals and vitamins is necessary;

The calcium and phosphorus
requirement is particularly
important in growth and lactation.
These two minerals should be
properly balanced.

The presence of each of these components does not guarantee completeness or balance,
but their absence can serve as an easy indicator to the practitioner and client that the diet
should be evaluated.

4 - Dietary training
Training for veterinarians
The importance of expertise in this field cannot be overemphasized. Competency requires extensive training in nutrition, and in cases where the diet will be used therapeutically, veterinary medical training is a must. Caution should be exercised when consulting individuals who do not have
the appropriate training and credentials to formulate diets. Diplomates of the ACVN or ECVCN
that provide this service have the necessary skills and training, and should be consulted.
Most veterinary nutritionists reserve the use of a home-cooked diet for:
- clients that cannot be dissuaded from home preparing their pet’s food
- and for patients with multiple, concurrent disease processes that cannot be appropriately
managed using commercially available diets.

471

Clinical practice

Home-cooked diets have the disadvantage of being more expensive than commercially prepared food, labor intensive and prone to “diet drift”. “Diet drift” refers to the tendency of some
clients to slowly adjust diets over time without realizing, or considering the consequences of
adding more of a particular ingredient or eliminating a necessary supplement. These concerns
aside, home-cooked diets are often the only option in instances where a commercial product is
unacceptable to the patient, or there is not one product that can meet that animals needs. In

Conclusion

addition, home-cooked diets also allow for the use of novel ingredients, can be formulated to
take advantage of recent research that has not found its way into a commercial formulation, or
that may not be economically practical to mass produce.
It may be difficult enough evaluating the total calorie content, never mind conducting a nutritional analysis of the diet solely on the basis of a list of ingredients. A veterinarian must however
be able to identify nutritional deficits in home-made diets to recognize the need to enlist the assistance of a trained veterinary nutritionist.
Technicians and nurses can also
be trained to provide client
education on the specific nutrient
differences between therapeutic
and maintenance diets.

Training for clinical staff
Integration of nutrition into clinical practice is dependent on fully utilizing a practice’s support
staff. Support staff can assist beyond stocking diet, feeding hospitalized patients and selling food.
Technicians and nursing staff should be trained to monitor daily food intake in all patients. This
requires that feeding orders be clearly provided for each animal. An American study showed that
in 22% of hospitalized dogs presenting an undernourished condition, the problem is simply due to
a poor understanding of written recommendations (Remillard et al, 2001).
Follow-up monitoring of dietary performance can become the responsibility of the technical staff.
Many support staff would welcome the additional responsibility of weigh-ins for weight loss programs or monitoring urine pH or specific gravity in patients with a history of urolithiasis. Receptionists should be trained to recognize the appropriate use of therapeutic diets so that client purchase inconsistencies can be quickly identified and addressed.

Conclusion
Without question, nutrition is a vital component to providing optimal patient care. Clinics that
have not already integrated nutritional management, monitoring and counseling into the care
of each animal, must begin to do so in order to provide the highest standard of care. Additional resources and expertise that can help any practice achieve these goals may be found in the
references listed in Table 4.

Royal Canin Nutritional Information

In a veterinary clinic, the organization of the food storage shelves should
help clients understand the nutritional goals, highlight all exclusive
veterinary diets, and facilitate management by the clinic’s staff.

Key Points
to remember:

Selected basic merchandising concepts
in the veterinary clinic
The goal of merchandising is to
grow sales to clients. In quality
terms, merchandising should also:
• Improve the client’s impression
of the clinic

Whatever the reason for the consultation, nutritional recommendations are always welcome. They are
especially appreciated:

A sober, discreet and rational presentation of the products is a significant
benchmark for owners that expect
personalized advice.

- when the patient is a very young
puppy, a puppy at the end of
growth or a dog that starts to
show signs of aging.

• Underscore the difference between
a clinic and a retailer

- when the reason for consultation
must entail a nutritional prescription, like obesity or neutering.

Owners expect the veterinary clinic
to differentiate itself from other
dog food outlets by offering highend specialist products.

Clinical practice

• Recruit new clients

476

- during routine visits: Health
Nutrition helps accentuate the food’s preventive role and increases
visits to the clinic.
• Reassure owners and
develop their loyalty
All communication tools should
focus on the major arguments: a
well nourished animal is healthy
and a good diet has a positive effect
on the animal’s longevity. Samples
or small trial packs encourage the
owner to try a food without risk.

Goals of retail space and
shelf organization

© M. Lechardoy. With kind permission of T. Hazan.

If the clinic’s staff has a key role in
providing nutritional advice, the
products’ placement in the shelves
should help owners understand
the indications. The four keys
points are:
- The species
- The aim: preserving the health of
the dog, preventing selected specific risks or adapting to a specific
pathological state
- The brands
- The segmentation criteria by
brand: age, size, breed, lifestyle,
etc

It is preferable for the owner to have ready access to brochures that convey the
veterinarian's instructions.

TO SUMMARIZE, MERCHANDISING IS ABOUT:
The right product

carry a range of nutritional products

In the right place

organize your space to present the
products optimally

At the right time

take account of the seasonal nature of sales

At the right price

be consistent in your pricing policy

With the right information

avoid gaps in stock
make instructional material available

477

Clinical practice

In the right quantity

Ideally, the space should be organized in such a way that owners are
led to buy a new supply of food for
their dog, and even to buy new
products for the dog that they
have not seen before (e.g. chewing
bars for dental hygiene).

Understanding Aggression in Dogs !
and its Relation to our Shelter Work"

Kelley Bollen, MS, CABC"

Owner/Director – Animal Alliances, LLC"
Director of Behavior Programs "
Maddie’s Shelter Medicine Program"
Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine"

Aggression is a complex behavior"

Definition: acts or threats designed to cause injury"
!Displays of aggression in dogs include lunging, snapping, and
"
"biting.""
!Threat behaviors include freezing, staring, snarling, and
"
"growling. "

Why are dogs sometimes aggressive?"

Aggression is Adaptive"
•! The goal of adaptive behavior is to survive"
•! In order to survive, an animal must adapt
"and control events that impact their
"very desire to survive"
•! Animals are genetically prepared to use
"behavior that will ensure their survival
"and control their environment."
•! Aggression is one behavioral response
"towards that goal. "
""
"

"

"

"

"

"

""

•! “Basic patterns of aggression seem to be "
"unalterable aspects of the basic genetic
"code of canines” (Coren, 2004)"
•! Like all animals, dogs react to fear with the
"Flight or Fight response "
•! Aggression serves a communicative function
"for dogs when dealing with conflict –
"whether it be offensive or defensive in
"nature."

Genetics and selective breeding"
•! Some breeds of dogs are bred
specifically to be more aggressive."

•! In addition to its genetic component, the degree
of aggressiveness exhibited by an individual is
also shaped by:"
"- Early experience (socialization, or lack there of)"
"- Learning (dogs learn that aggression “works”). "

The major influences to any behavior"
Genetics"

Environment"

Learning"

Two basic categories of aggression"
•! Respondent Aggressive behavior"
•! Operant Aggressive behavior"

Respondent Aggression – reflex-like
aggression evoked or elicited by aversive
stimulation (pain-elicited aggression)."

"(respondent aggression is one reason that the use of

aversive positive punishment (shock) can be problematic)"

Operant Aggression - goal directed
behavior which allows the aggressor to
obtain something desirable or escape or
avoid something undesirable. "
Aggressive behavior, like other behavior, is
driven by reinforcements."

With Operant Aggression there is always
reinforcement."
•! External reinforcement"

–!other being retreats"
–!retention of something they are coveting"

•! Internal reinforcement"

–!satisfaction of a drive"
–!surge of epinephrine (adrenaline) "

Operant Aggression can be Offensive or
Defensive in nature"
•! Offensive – distance decreasing behavior"
•! Defensive – distance increasing behavior"

Just like humans"
•! Offensive aggression stems from anger"
–!angry dogs, like angry humans, may use
violence to express their rage"

•! Defensive aggression stems from fear "
–!scared dogs, like scared humans defend
themselves if necessary (flight or fight)"

•! Fear and anger are basic emotions shared by
humans and dogs."
•! Fear and anger originate in the limbic system the emotional center of the brain (specifically the
amygdala)."

Dog vs. Human"

Cerebral Cortex (the thinking part of the brain)"

Every dog can bite"

“They are alive and they have teeth” Jean Donaldson"

Ian Dunbar’s Bite Scale"
•! Level 1- Dog growls, lunges, snarls-no teeth touch skin. "
•! Level 2- Teeth touch skin but no puncture. May have red
"mark/minor bruise or minor scratches"
•! Level 3- Punctures ! the length of a canine tooth, one to
"four holes, single bite. Bruising . No tearing or slashes."
•! Level 4- One to four holes from a single bite, one hole
"deeper than ! the length of a canine tooth. Black
"bruising, tears and/or slashing wounds. Dog clamped
"down and shook or slashed victim."
•! Level 5- Multiple bites at Level 4 or above."
•! Level 6- Any bite resulting in death of a human."

Every dog has a different
‘aggression threshold’"
Threshold - the level that a stimulus must be "
" "exceeding to elicit a response"
Aggression threshold – the point at which
"aggression is triggered"

Aggression Threshold"
Low threshold"

High threshold"

Dogs have different thresholds for
different stimuli!
Bite threshold"
Snap threshold"
Growl threshold"
Freezes"

Uncomfortable"

Trigger

from Jean Donaldson – Culture Clash"

When things come together – "
"
"you can reach the bite threshold"
Bite threshold"
Snap threshold"
Growl threshold"
Freezes"
Uncomfortable"

Discomfort Threshold!
Bite threshold"
Snap threshold"
Growl threshold"
Freezes"

Uncomfortable"

Discomfort Threshold"
•! Behaviors seen when a dog is
"uncomfortable - not considered
"aggression"
•! Precursors of aggression"
•! Alarm bells are going off "
•! Starting to “toggle into their limbic
"system” (Sdao)"
•! Freezing – happens in the moment before
"they toggle over"

Aggression Precursors!
(Discomfort Threshold)"

•! Dogs speak with their bodies"
•! They are always telling us how they feel
"about a situation"
•! These signals are missed by the average
"pet owner who can’t read dog body
"language "

Passive Appeasement

Appeasement signals represent a lack of confidence and serve to avoid hostility"
All figures from How to Speak Dog by Stanley Coren "

Nervous about something you are doing"
"

"" ..or wants a belly rub"

Active Appeasement

Appeasement signals represent a lack of confidence and serve to avoid hostility"

Active Appeasement "

Stress and Anxiety

Stressed and anxious"

Alert and Attentive

Alert"

Fear/Defensive Aggression

This dog is conflicted between using appeasement signals and aggressive
signals to increase social distance. This is the position of a classic “fear biter”."

Whale eye (half moon eye) "

Wide Eye"

Mouth – look for:"
•! Closed tense mouth "
•! Going from open relaxed mouth to "
" "closed tense mouth"
"- Worried dog – closed mouth but eyebrows
"are raised upward"
"- Angry dog – closed mouth but "
" "eyebrows are pulled down "
" "and together (tension around "
" "the eyes)"

Body – look for:"
•! Weight shifted forward = taking charge"
""
"- offensive"
•! Weight shifted back = diffusing - defensive"
•! Generally stiff body"
•! Moving from a relaxed body to a stiff body "
•! Freezing – microsecond freezes are clear
"warnings they don’t like what you are doing"

Other ways dogs communicate that
they are uncomfortable"

Displacement Behaviors"

Flicking Tongue"

Licking Lips"

Yawning when not
tired"

Shaking off when they are not wet"

Scratching when they don’t have
skin irritation"

•! Avoidance Behaviors"
"
"

"
"

"turning head away"
"turning whole body away"

Aggression to Humans "
•!
•!
•!
•!

to the owner!
to visitors to the home!
to strangers outside!
to children!

Aggression to Owners"
•! Dominance has historically been
blamed for any aggression directed
towards an owner."
•! “Dominance aggression” is an overused term that carries the negative
implication that the dog is “trying to
be the boss” which often leads to
corrective methods that are abusive."

The Dominance Myth"
•! 20-30 years ago, social dominance theory and
ideas about wolf behavior in the wild were the
primary models that guided how dogs were
trained."

•! This theory was based on studies of captive
packs of unrelated wolves and thus bears no
relationship to the social structure of natural
packs much less dogs. ""
"

"

"

"

"

"

"

""

Certainly there are “assertive” dogs"

Some dogs may be more prone to learn an active
defensive coping strategy during social conflict in
order to control aversive outcomes (Lindsay,
2000)."
The dog learns that dominant behavior helps him to
acquire certain resources or to avoid or escape
some specific stimuli (O’Heare, 2007)"
The underlying behavioral motivations are not to
enhance dominance status but simply to terminate
a perceived threat or challenge (Lindsay, 2000)."

•! It is no longer acceptable to advise owners
to “show the dog that you are the boss”
using aggressive acts such as alpha rolls."
•! Not only do these techniques often make
the problem worse, they can be very
dangerous for the owner to attempt."
•! Unfortunately these techniques are still
recommended and many dogs have
experienced them. "

Other reasons dogs show !
aggression to their owners:"

Resource guarding"
Some dogs aggressively guard "
resources (food, toys, bones, "
resting places)"

Dogs are the descendents of the wolf, and wolves
being social predators, are natural resource
guarders and this ancestral trait is sometimes
triggered. "

Maybe the most common reason
for aggression directed to an
owner:"
FEAR"

Humans are also an aggressive species"
•! We resort to punishment to deal with many
issues. Physical punishment can lead to
defensive aggression as the dog learns he
must protect himself."
•! Inappropriate punishment (after the fact)
confuses the dog and can also lead to
defensive aggression as the dog learns that
their owner is unpredictably aggressive."

Aggression to Visitors"
•! Dogs are naturally territorial and can be
aggressive to people who enter their homes or
yards. "
•! This behavior can also stem from fear, lack of
socialization or a bad experience."

Aggression to Strangers"
•! A dog that is aggressive to approaching
"people while on a walk, may be reacting
"this way due to:"
–! Fear "
–! Lack of socialization "
–! A bad experience with a stranger"
–! Reinforcement from owner "
–! Resource guarding (good owners "
" "are precious resources)"

Aggression to Children"
•! Many dogs are not properly socialized to
children during their socialization period"
•! Children do scary things to dogs"
" "- rush up to them"
" "- give them direct eye contact"
" "- pull, pinch, poke"
" "- HUG"
"

""

Aggression to other dogs"

•!
•!
•!
•!

Fear"
Lack of socialization "
Bad experience"
Bred or trained to do so"

Although most dog fighting is ritualized
behavior – a dog aggressive dog can
inflict serious injury or even death "

Dog aggressive dog are dangerous
to other dogs AND humans"

Many people are bitten trying to break up dog fights"
"
"Especially if its your own dog being attacked!"

Even though aggression is!
normal dog behavior:"
•! Aggressive behavior can be very
dangerous."
•! An inappropriate response by the human
object of an aggressive display may incite
an escalation of the aggression."
•! Dogs exhibiting aggression towards
humans is unacceptable in our society."

More than 5 million people are bitten by dogs in US every year."
800,000 of those bitten each year need medical attention."
1,000 people treated in ER each day for dog bites."
26 people killed by dogs each year"
Children between the ages of 5-9 are the most common victims
of dog bites."
90% of young children are bitten by their own dog – in fact,
87% of biting dogs are owned dogs – not a stray issue."

Most children are bitten in the face"

“5-yr-old suffers facial injury in attack
from dog” - Palm Bay Florida, 1/12/11"
•! Harrington was headed to work and had
"dropped Jahvon off at the house of a
"longtime friend who has several dogs."
•! Moments later, the boy was outside playing and,
"according to Palm Bay police, either grabbed
"the dog by the collar or attempted to ride the
"85-pound canine like a horse."
•! The dog grabbed at the child's head with his jaws
"and shook him, crushing facial bones around
"one eye and ripping a portion of an ear,
"police said."

“Dog Bites 1-yr-old”!
Tennessee - 10/22/09"
•! A one year old is rushed to the hospital after
being badly bitten in the face by their newly
adopted great dane.#"
•! Amber Plott says their new dog#attacked their 19
month old little girl.# Plott#says she wandered too
close to his food at the wrong time."
•! “I set the food bowl down, wasn't thinking, went
to answer the door because we had a delivery, it
happened in a second.""

“A two-year-old boy will be scarred for life
after he was attacked by his grandmother's
collie dog.” 9/10/10"
•! "Joshua was stroking the dog, Rossie,
"when she jumped up and latched onto
"his face.”"
•! "Rossie pulled him to the ground and
"wouldn't release him.”"

Toni Clannachan, 10, was bitten in the face
by the family’s dog while playing in a school
friend's yard on Tuesday.!
9/2/10 Scotland"

Dogs and kids"
•! Many people think their dog is fine with
"their children because they don’t bite
"them."
•! The dog may be just tolerating the child
"and the things he does to and around
"him."
•! When a dog is “tolerating” something – he
"is just on the edge."
•! Not enough of a buffer "

When a dog has the propensity for
aggression - management is often the
best we can hope for"
Although we use behavior modification techniques
to raise the threshold for aggression, an
aggressive dog will always need to be managed
because aggression is difficult to modify."
"

"
"
"

"- often has a genetic basis "

"- is a self-reinforcing behavior"
"- becomes an automatic or habitual response"
"
" (when an animal is emotional it resorts to
"
"
"
" habitual behavior)"

Aggression is NOT curable!"
•! You can modify aggressive behavior but
"
"you can not take it out of the dog."
•! The dog has learned that aggression "
"works for him and that behavioral ""
"pathway in the brain will always be there."
•! The dog can tap into it at any time
"regardless of any behavior modification"

Behavior Modification"
•! The goal is to raise the threshold for
"aggression in the situations where the
"dog displays aggression."
•! We must also prevent displays of
"aggression during a behavior mod
"program so the dog does not continue
"to practice the behavior."
" ""

Shelter Dogs"
•! Many dogs are surrendered to shelters
"because of behavior problems (including
"aggression). "
•! The majority of surrendered dogs are
adolescents who:"
" "- are well past their socialization period"
"
"

"- have learned which behaviors “work” for them"
"- have had little to no formal training"

Shelters should conduct
behavior evaluations before
putting dogs up for adoption"
Because they are placing these
dogs into the homes of unskilled
and unknowledgeable people
(average pet owners), they are
obligated to make the best
matches possible and keep the
family and the community safe
from potentially aggressive dogs."

"

""

The average pet owner:"
•! Knows little to nothing about dog behavior"
•! Might take the dog to one training class"
•! Has trouble even getting the dog to sit
"and lie down on cue – much less come
"when called (even after taking a class)."
•! Wants a good pet – a calm, well behaved
"member of their family."

•! The majority of my (and every behaviorist)
behavior consultations involve aggression –
either to humans or other dogs"
•! Most owners are clueless about how to handle
their aggressive dog"
•! Some owners actually make the problem worse
with inappropriate responses"
•! Many clients are unable to carry through on a
behavior modification program"

•! I am committed to encouraging the shelter/
rescue community to conduct behavioral
evaluations BECAUSE of the clients I have
worked with. "
•! I have seen their fear and heartache as they try
to deal with, and make decisions about, their
aggressive dog. "
•! I feel that it is the responsibility of the
organizations placing dogs into new homes to do
their very best to make good matches and make
sure the dogs they are placing are safe."

Shelter Dog Behavior Evaluations"
•! All designed to try to get to know the dog
"BEFORE he is placed into a new home."
•! All of the procedures out there have
"similar components"
"
"
"
"

"- Sue Sternberg’s Assess-a-pet"
"- Emily Weiss’s SAFER test"
"- Amy Marder’s MATCH-UP"
"- ‘SSwKBT’"

A good behavior evaluation, that is
conducted and interpreted well, can really
help you get to know the shelter dogs
being considered for placement."
"

"
"
"

"

"
"
"
"
"

"- identify truly aggressive dogs"

"- set up in-house behavior modification
"
"and training programs"
"- recommend best matches with "
"
"adopters"
"- counsel adopters"

What do behavioral evaluations
do for shelters?"
•! Enables shelters to make better
placements with adoptive families."
•! Prevents dangerous dogs from being
"returned to the community!"
•! Safety "
•! Reputation"
•! Liability"

Shelter responsibility"
“A shelter that places dogs into the homes
of families should know that the public
expects that only suitable dogs will be
placed. Essentially an implied warranty of
suitability arises from the very relationship
between the public and the shelter.”"
"

"

"

"

"www.dogbitelaw.com"

Shelter Liability"
“Civil liability will result from adopting out a
dog that is known to be dangerous, is
known to have dangerous propensities, or
is misrepresented as being safe” "
"

"www.dogbitelaw.com"

Even organizations with “no kill” policies
acknowledge that some animals must be
euthanized. "
“Animals that exhibit signs of a behavioral or
temperamental defect that could pose a
health or safety risk or otherwise be
unsuitable for placement as a pet will be
euthanized.” "
" "
""
"

"

"California Civil Code section 1834.4"

What Kinds of Dogs
Should Shelters Be
Placing ?"
•! Behaviorally Healthy Dogs:"
•! Sociable"
•! Tolerant of handling"
•! Do not aggressively "
" "guard resources"
•! Tolerant of other dogs"

Why is this so important??"

My Research"
Data on 2017 Evaluated Shelter Dogs"

Behavioral evaluation and demographic
information in the assessment of
aggressiveness in shelter dogs!
Kelley S. Bollen & Joseph Horowitz!
Applied Animal Behaviour Science!
Vol. 112 (2008)!

Aggressive History"
•! 217 tested dogs had a known history of

aggression in their previous home based on
information from their surrender profile"

•! 90% of these dogs exhibited aggression

"during one or more components of the
"evaluation."

Statistical Analysis"
Dogs with a history of aggression in
their previous home were 12 times
more likely to fail the evaluation
than those without a history of
aggression."

The fact that nearly all of the dogs with a
history of aggression exhibited
aggression during the behavior
evaluation…"
"

"tells us that this behavior
"evaluation is a reliable tool to
"identify dogs with the propensity for
"aggression."

Unsocial Dogs"
•! Dogs who did not exhibit any signs of
"sociability during the sociability test were
"labeled “unsocial” (N=315)."
•! 74% of these unsocial dogs exhibited
"aggression during the behavior
"evaluation."
•! The remainder of the unsocial dogs were
"adopted out."

Borderline Dogs"
•! Some dogs were deemed adoptable despite
failing one or two component tests (sociability
test not included)."
•! The “failed” responses displayed by the
borderline dogs were milder forms of
aggression compared to the responses of the
dogs deemed un-adoptable."

Statistical Analysis"
•! Borderline dogs were twice as likely to exhibit
aggressive behavior post adoption than no
issue dogs. "
•! Unsocial dogs were 5 times more likely to
exhibit aggression post adoption than no
issue dogs."

What is our responsibility?"
•! Evaluate the dogs before putting them up
"for adoption"
•! Evaluate them WELL (trained evaluators)"
•! Make good decisions"
•! Keep the dogs behaviorally healthy "
•! Make good matches"
•! Educate your adopters "

What about behavior modification?"
•! Is it feasible to modify aggressive behavior
"in the shelter?"
•! Depends on many factors"
–!the behavior "

•! how severe"
•! how well practiced"

–!the shelter’s resources "
•! experienced staff"
•! time"

The limitations"
•! Time – most shelters are understaffed and
"overworked. "
•! Experience – very few shelters can afford
"to have a behaviorist or trainer on staff"
•! Even if there is someone on staff whose
"job it is to work with the dogs – how
"much time will be dedicated to each
"dog?"

Impossible to control of the environment!
In order to modify aggressive behavior:"
"- There needs to be consistency in the
"program."
"- You need to prevent the display of the
"aggressive behavior so that it doesn’t
"continue to be reinforced."

Lets take dog aggression as an example"
•! One person is in charge of doing the
"behavior modification protocol "
•! Two sessions/day – 15 minutes each"
•! In between, the dog is housed in a line of
"kennels where other dogs walk by all day"
•! Different people walk the dog during the
"week – none do the protocol"
•! He has to walk past other dogs on his way in
"and out of his kennel "

The other major problem:"
•! Learned behavior doesn’t generalize well
(unless it involves a strong emotion like fear)"

•! If you successfully modify a behavior in
the shelter environment, it doesn’t mean
that it’s changed in other environments
(like an adoptive home). "
•! You will have learned whether the dog is
receptive to behavior modification. "

Important things if you do behavior
modification in your shelter"
•! Make sure you re-test the dog "

–!In a different place from where you did the
modification"
–!By a person other than the one who did the
work"

•! Make sure you counsel the adopter"
•! Make sure you do follow-up!!!!"

Another factor to consider…"
•! Who are your adopters?"
" "- the average pet owner?"
" "- families with children?"
" "- experienced dog trainers?"
" "- animal behaviorists?"

Rescues"
Is it okay to send the aggressive dogs to
rescue?"
At least its not you making the euthanasia
decision."

•! Blue was sent to a pitbull rescue after he
bit three volunteers at the shelter “during
play”"
•! He was adopted out by them to a person
who happened to live in the same city as
the shelter who sent him to rescue"
•! Blue was surrendered to the shelter 3
months later for biting someone severely."

What is our responsibility to the
adopters?"
•! Provide them a safe pet."
•! Educate them at the time of the adoption
"so they can help their new dog adjust
"to their home."
•! Be available when they have issues."

Case Reports"
•! Just a few stories about adopted dogs
and the struggles people have with them."

Ellie – FS – terr mix"
•! I first saw Ellie in 2005 when she was 3 yrs old"
•! History:"

–!adopted from a shelter at 3 months old"
–!exhibited RG first week"
–!got worse with age - at 2 yrs old – severely
"aggressive with new stuffed mouse - would growl,
"snarl, snap and lunge at them if they even tried to
"enter the room – went on for hours"
–!bit daughter in foot when too close to food bowl"
–!bit daughter again when too close to new toy"
–!bit baby sitter when trying to get something from her"

Issues at consult:"
"- Severe possession aggression – multiple items"
"- Severe food bowl aggression – had to stop
"feeding her in the crate because she started
"guarding the crate"
"- Crate aggression after above started (even
"without food). Lunges, growls, snarls, snaps
"and throws herself against the front of the
"crate if they come close (husband is only one
"who can let her out of crate)"
"- “We don’t even try to get her off the furniture”"

•! I set them up with a intensive management,
training and behavior modification program"
•! At my 2 month post consult check-in they told
me that “they aren’t doing too much work
anymore – just trying to manage her better”. "
"She was doing okay until they went of vacation –
bit the dog sitter 3 times – she called them and
said she couldn’t continue to watch her so they
had to come home from vacation early"

•! Few weeks ago they called for another consult"
•! Ellie –now 9 years old"
•! Said my methods helped them be able to manage
"her better but they didn’t follow through with
"behavior modification."
•! Still terribly aggressive – lives with a harness and
"tether leash on so she can’t get a hold of
"something and guard it. Has bitten all family
"members several times over the years. "
•! They have never been able to make a euthanasia
"decision even though she is dangerous."
•! They love her but they are afraid of her. "

Samantha – 8 mth –spaniel mix"

–! 1st week – growled and lunged at 4 year old"

•! Issues at consult:"

–! Aggressive to all visitors "
–! Aggressive to people while on a walk – if they get
"too close"
–! Aggressive to vet – who referred them to me"
–! Attacked a dog at the park recently (out of
"character for her – usually loves dogs)"

•! Owners feel restricted – “We can’t go out, can’t
have company, can’t have play dates for the kids
at our home, can’t have a baby sitter in…”"
•! Samantha is crated a lot."
•! She is not getting much exercise because they
fear she will bite someone on a walk."
•! Samantha is fear aggressive "
•! Most likely stems from a lack of socialization
during her critical period"
•! Bad past experiences may also contribute"

•! During the history gathering I found out some very
"disturbing information (and then noticed the
"woman had her hand in her pocket the whole time we
"were talking)."
•! For the past 2 months they have been using a remote
"shock collar on Samantha at the recommendation
"of their trainer. "
•! Samantha gets shocked anytime she exhibits
"aggression to a visitor or stranger."
•! I spent 3 hours explaining why that method was making
"things worse and teaching them how to use
"positive counterconditioning methods."
•! They were in contact with me for about a month and
"then contact stopped. "
•! I fear for Samantha"

Niles – 12 wk old “dixie dog”"
•! Pup exhibited significant food aggression soon
"after bringing him home."
•! They had been working with him for three
"weeks and he was responding well."
•! Called me because he bit the wife over a treat –
"broke skin – needed stitches."
•! Have a 2 year old in the home (which is why they
"wanted a puppy)."
•! Their last dog (older with arthritis) bit their son
"once when he fell on her."

•! After hearing the history I advised them to
"return the dog – mainly because of the child."
•! I explained that the work they could do to
"modify the resource guarding would not
"generalize to their son."
•! They were heartbroken because they were so
"bonded to him already."
•! They really felt they could keep their son safe
"and were unwilling to give him back."
•! Three months later – the dog bit the child in the
"face and they returned him – devastated and
"heartbroken by the whole ordeal."

Katie – bc/flatcoat mix - rescue"
•! Read Email"
•! I visited the home and Katie (who was on leash at
"my request) barked, growled, snarled and
"lunged at me the entire hour I was there."
•! I told her that I did not think she was going to be
"safe around the grandkids and that she was
"going to require a LOT of work."
•! The client was torn because she felt so bad for
"the dog and wanted to help her but she
"didn’t want an aggressive dog. "

•! She called me the next day to tell me that they
were brining her back because when her
husband got home from work that day, Katie
lunged at and bit him."
•! This four day ordeal tore my client apart."
•! Not to mention what it did to Katie"

The small dog question"
•! Is aggression in small dogs acceptable?"
•! Should shelters consider aggression in
"small breed dogs okay because
"“everyone knows small dogs bite” or
"“they can’t do as much damage”"
•! Do people who love small breed dogs want
"an aggressive pet?"

Other comments from clients"
•!
•!
•!
•!

“we feel trapped”"
“we are prisoners to our dog”"
“our kids can’t have a normal social life”"
“I’m anxious all the time that something is
going to happen”"

•! Our responsibility to our adopters is to
"give them the nice pet they came in for."
•! Not a dog who is “iffy”"
•! Not a dog who requires a ton of
"management to be safe"
•! Not a dog that requires months of
"behavior modification"

A PET!"

What is our responsibility !
to the dogs?"
•! Dogs with issues stay at the shelter longer
"(especially if you are waiting for an
"adopter that can handle him)."
•! Is long-term sheltering humane?"
•! What would these dogs say?"

Housed for 1 year"

Housed for 5 years"

Housed for 8 years"

•! Are these dogs better off in a sanctuary?"
•! The definition of a sanctuary is:"
" "
"‘a place of refuge and protection’"
•! A nice place where they can live out their
"lives because even though its not a
"home, its still better than death – right?"

Almost 200 dogs housed in this “sanctuary”
- for life"

•! If you were to die – would you want your
pet to be here for the remainder of his
life?"
•! Don’t do this to our “best friends”"
•! They deserve better from us."

What is the role of a
shelter?"

And to be HUMANE"

Make smart decisions about the dogs
you send to families. Its your job!"
