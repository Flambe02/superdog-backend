document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 376/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] all right so first I want to demonstrate [00:01] how we're going to teach our dog the in [00:03] motion exercises using reward-based [00:05] training okay so we'll do the sit first [00:11] heel walking and then what we're going [00:15] to do is we're gonna say sit then lift [00:17] free then reward okay I'm gonna buy my [00:21] dog back [00:22] watch again I say sit I lift free good [00:30] sit then lift free good girl sit lift [00:39] and you notice I keep moving I want to [00:43] keep moving I want my dog to understand [00:45] they have to go into the set free [00:47] wherever I tell them to do that command [00:50] a lot of times when you first start [00:52] doing sitting motion exercises your dogs [00:55] gonna want to continue to walk with you [00:57] so you want to make sure they stop in [00:59] that position again we're walking sit [01:03] and lift making sure they stay in that [01:07] position free and as your dog gets [01:10] better then you can start to use a [01:13] mirror or reflection to get your dog to [01:16] do the behavior so I have a reflection [01:18] directly in front of me so what I would [01:20] do is I'd watch my reflection heal what [01:23] sit good girl and I'm using the [01:28] reflection to make sure that she's doing [01:30] it correctly good all right Rick so [01:34] that's how we're gonna teach or sit in [01:36] motion using reward-based training first [01:39] time you're gonna have to turn your [01:41] entire body watch your dog make sure [01:43] they go into the sit and then reward [01:45] them in that position it is better to [01:48] bring the reward to them if your dog has [01:50] a tendency to take a bunch of steps [01:52] before going into the city so I might [01:54] want to go sit and look death comes back [01:58] and reward them in place sometimes with [02:01] this exercise if you're using the [02:03] terminal marker they're gonna want to [02:05] jump forward that's what they're gonna [02:07] be thinking about if we're thinking [02:08] about reward placement and you might get [02:10] the dog that takes a few extra steps [02:11] before going into the [02:13] say you can also do this using a toy [02:16] heel so as you're walking you can say [02:20] sit lift your dog sit you say free or [02:24] whatever your tonal marker is and you're [02:27] gonna throw the toy over your dog's head [02:29] so then at this point your dog is [02:31] anticipating the toy going behind them [02:33] so this way your dog is anticipating the [02:35] reward going behind them so they stop [02:37] really fast for that sitting motion [02:39] that's a great way to do this command [02:41] okay now I'm going to show you how we're [02:43] gonna do that down in motion using an [02:46] reward-based training we're gonna guide [02:48] our dog into the heel position and it's [02:50] very similar to this sit in motion we're [02:53] gonna say heel we're gonna walk then [02:56] we're gonna say down guide our dog into [02:59] the down and then reward up heel down [03:06] guide them reward good girl [03:09] and the main thing is continuing that [03:13] foreign motion down very nice very nice [03:18] heel and again it's a lot of repetition [03:32] down and all I'm doing is I'm cupping [03:37] the food in my hand when I say the [03:39] command I'm dropping my hand down to [03:41] reward her in place and I'm continuing [03:43] my forward move movement watching her to [03:47] make sure she doesn't break that [03:48] position okay so that's how we're gonna [03:50] be teaching our down in motion using the [03:53] reward based training [03:54] same with our sit in motion we could use [03:57] a toy and throw it back over their head [03:59] to get them to really stop quickly in [04:02] anticipation of the reward being behind [04:04] them you don't want to do too many of [04:07] these in a row though because as you [04:09] just noticed she started to anticipate [04:11] the down in motion and she was starting [04:14] to stop on her own before I gave her the [04:15] command [04:16] so again when we're thinking about [04:17] pattern training we don't want it to too [04:19] many in a row where you have the dog [04:21] that's waiting to go into the down [04:23] because that's what they're expecting [04:24] you to do so make sure you're mixing [04:26] this up [04:26] all right I'm gonna bring Ari back and [04:30] we're gonna do the stand in motion this [04:32] is the more difficult one and we're [04:34] gonna be using reward-based training for [04:36] this as well [04:37] he'll so as we're walking we're just [04:39] gonna say stand guide her up and leave [04:43] her in the stand position heel and shoes [04:48] anticipating the down again right there [04:49] so again we're walking stand [04:54] good girl he'll stand very nice free [05:05] guide our back stand and before I go [05:13] into free before I go into a running [05:16] stand in motion or a running down in [05:18] motion I want to make sure I have it [05:20] nice and smooth the way I want it to [05:22] look when I'm doing it at a slower pace [05:25] free all right we'll do another one [05:30] he'll you can see she's still [05:32] anticipating that down but I want her to [05:34] do the standing that the down good girl [05:40] good stand three good girl [06:01] stand and she's starting to get it now [06:06] she's starting to pay attention to what [06:07] I'm saying she's not dropping down into [06:09] the down she's staying in the stand [06:11] he'll stand very nice come [06:23] he'll stand now I'm making the physical [06:31] queue less and less free excellent and I [06:37] would continue to do this using a [06:38] reflection or a mirror that I can place [06:41] so that way I can watch my dog while [06:44] she's in heel position give her the [06:45] command continue my forward movement [06:47] without looking at her to make sure [06:49] she's doing it correctly and if she [06:51] makes a mistake I can readjust help her [06:54] out and do it again that way we know we [06:56] have a dog that is doing the behavior [06:58] not just because we're watching them you [07:00] will notice the first time you don't [07:02] watch them they're not going to want to [07:04] stay in the position because we're gonna [07:05] say oh you're not watching me alright so [07:07] they're very aware of where we're [07:09] looking and what we're doing so that [07:10] mirror or even a training partner is [07:13] gonna help you accomplish that but keep [07:15] doing this and you'll have a very nice [07:16] set motion down in motion and stand in [07:19] motion now I'm going to show you guys [07:21] how to do each one of these using [07:23] pressure based training alright so we're [07:26] gonna start off with a set motion using [07:28] the leash all I'm going to do is I'm [07:30] gonna give the command usually the way [07:32] that I like to do this is I give the [07:33] command one of my left foot hits the [07:34] ground and then as my right foot hits [07:36] the ground that's my cue to turn and [07:38] lift the leash so it should look [07:40] something like this cue so we step off [07:44] and then we say sit and then lift first [07:50] time you do it you're going to fly a [07:51] little bit of leash brochure getting [07:53] your dog into that position and then [07:55] releasing the leash continuing that [07:57] forward movement break a common mistake [08:00] that a lot of people make when they're [08:01] first doing this exercise is they'll do [08:04] this you see how I stopped we don't want [08:13] to stop we want to continue that forward [08:16] movement we want to get our dog used to [08:18] seeing us continuing moving forward [08:20] break she's getting a little tired [08:26] Mary so then we say free good [08:32] [Music] [08:34] very nice back into the heel sit then [08:38] lift release very simple way to do this [08:43] but that's how we're going to be [08:44] teaching our sitting motion using leash [08:46] pressure now I'm going to show you how [08:49] to teach the down in motion using these [08:51] pressure break what I like to do for [08:54] this one is as I'm walking with my dog [08:58] I'm gonna have my leash hanging so then [09:01] I'm gonna say down then I'll step and [09:05] then I'll step on the leash okay so it [09:08] will look like this I have the leash [09:09] hanging down step on the leash keep [09:12] going alright so you want to make sure [09:14] that your dog already knows the leash [09:16] pressure good alright and we're gonna go [09:20] right into it for instructional purposes [09:22] only I'm gonna call this coucher because [09:26] she knows it so well and I want you to [09:28] see the leash pressure we say heel we [09:31] step leashes hanging coucher and then we [09:36] step on it and we continue walking [09:38] forward so it should look like that [09:40] break come on I'll show you going the [09:43] other direction [09:44] heel again as we're walking coucher and [09:50] then we step on the leash and we [09:52] continue that forward moving free one [09:57] more time so we're walking cliche [10:06] just like that so that's how we're going [10:08] to use our leash pressure to get our dog [10:11] to go into it down that's one of two [10:13] techniques break for the least pressure [10:15] the other least pressure technique is [10:17] you're going to give the command heel [10:20] and what you want to do is as you're [10:24] walking with the leash after you give [10:26] the command you're gonna slide down the [10:28] leash and place your dog into the down [10:30] and continue walking okay so it should [10:32] look like this heel coucher just like [10:37] that okay so it's a smooth motion break [10:42] [Music] [10:44] okay bring her back into position so [10:48] we're walking again coucher and then you [10:54] keep that forward motion so nose that's [10:56] going to be the two ways we're going to [10:58] teach our down in motion using leash [11:00] pressure lastly we have our stand in [11:04] motion braking now with the stand in [11:08] motion I'm not going to demonstrate that [11:10] with the stand in motion what you want [11:13] to do is you want to teach your dog how [11:15] to wear a belly band so what a belly [11:19] band is is it's basically the leash that [11:25] goes around our dog's waist so before [11:28] you do this you have to teach your dog [11:31] how to wear the belly band so I'm going [11:35] to take this and I'm going to put it [11:36] around her waist and the same way that [11:42] we teach our dog how to respond to the [11:46] collar around their neck we have to [11:48] teach it around their waist sit yes so [11:53] what you want to do with that is you [11:55] want to slowly start to lift up so they [11:58] feel a little bit of tension free and [12:03] then I'm going to mark and reward come [12:05] on baby sit this is only used for the [12:08] stand so again free I accidentally said [12:12] her come and sit what we're gonna do is [12:15] we're gonna lift up free [12:18] girl sit free sit free so you can see [12:30] she's starting to respond nicely to it [12:37] pretty good and once we have that down [12:41] then we can use this for our stand-in [12:45] motion [12:45] so the stand-in motion I prefer to teach [12:48] that using a reward based training if [12:51] you have a training partner you could [12:52] teach your dog the belly band make sure [12:54] they know how to respond to it the same [12:56] way they would respond to the counter [12:58] that they have on their neck when you're [12:59] teaching them leash pressure work then [13:01] all you're going to do is you're gonna [13:02] have your training partner walk behind [13:04] you and when you say stand they simply [13:08] stop allowing the dog to move forward so [13:10] this is something you need a training [13:11] partner with however I've been able to [13:13] teach the stand in motion by using just [13:16] the reward based training and I've had [13:17] success with that so that's what I would [13:19] recommend especially if you don't have [13:21] somebody to work with you on a regular [13:22] basis to get it to that point where [13:24] you're going to need it to be for [13:25] competition you can do it by yourself [13:27] just by using that reward based training [13:30] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 379/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] okay guys today I'm gonna be introducing [00:03] the place command and for me the place [00:07] command is a bulb you can see in the [00:10] back a bowl that I place upside down and [00:12] my goal or my intentions are to get her [00:15] to place her front paws on the bowl and [00:18] what I'm gonna do after that when she [00:20] understands it a little bit more she's [00:22] never done it so we'll see how she [00:24] responds and I'm gonna guide her and do [00:26] the best I can to lure her with the food [00:28] to get her on to the position some dogs [00:31] this may be a little bit more difficult [00:32] some it's easier we'll see how she is [00:35] and then once she understands that [00:36] concept some of the future goals is to [00:38] get her to pivot her back end while [00:41] maintaining her paws on the bowl this [00:44] helps a dog with that rear-end awareness [00:46] so they know that their back end is [00:48] something that they can manipulate [00:48] without moving the front end and this [00:51] will help when were teaching her to flip [00:53] into heel position and really again have [00:56] that awareness of her own body so let's [00:59] go ahead and do that we can also use [01:00] this as a target for different exercises [01:02] later on so I'm gonna bring it over and [01:05] let's see we can get her to put her paws [01:09] on the front of the bowl yes good girl [01:13] very nice yes so she's an easy one [01:16] that's good and I'm gonna keep rewarding [01:18] her for keeping her paws on there very [01:22] good that's good good girl very good [01:28] girl aren't you now I'm gonna have her [01:30] come off cuz I want her to get those [01:31] paws back on so we can repeat the [01:33] exercise yes very nice so she's a very [01:36] easy dog to teach this to I've had some [01:40] other dogs where they do everything in [01:42] their power to avoid the bowl and that [01:44] could be a little bit of a struggle but [01:46] she just places her paws right on it [01:49] which is very cool let's go back this [01:50] way sweetie and back this way let's get [01:52] those paws on there yes good girl yes [01:55] see if I can get her to maintain it yes [01:58] by spacing out the markers yes very good [02:02] yes excellent and if the bowl is too [02:05] small that's gonna make it more [02:06] difficult so I like to use a bowl like [02:09] this one this is a basic metal bowl [02:11] made by Kong so it has the rubber on the [02:14] top and that makes it easier for the [02:16] dogs to have a little bit of traction [02:18] with their paws the fullmetal bulls are [02:21] a little bit more difficult for them [02:23] I know trainers that will also use horse [02:25] bulls big horse balls to start out again [02:28] a bigger target to be a little bit [02:29] easier and the horse bulls are made out [02:32] of rubber as well so it's easier for the [02:34] dogs to maintain that position with [02:36] their paws so let's bring her around and [02:37] get her and put her paws back on it [02:39] since she's doing so well I'm gonna see [02:41] if I can get her to pivot that back in [02:44] so I'm gonna get her paws on there good [02:46] girl very nice company the food in my in [02:49] and I'm gonna turn yes good girl so [02:51] she's turning her back in already very [02:53] nice yes good you see that that is [02:56] awesome that's exactly what I want good [02:59] girl [03:00] let's see if we can get that back in a [03:01] pivot yes good girl and we're gonna take [03:04] her back the other way all right here we [03:06] go you ready hardly let's see if we can [03:08] go the other way don't get too port come [03:10] on here we go come on you can do it yes [03:14] good girl very good excellent so that's [03:22] exactly what I want that's a good [03:24] session for there and you can see how [03:26] this is going to advance later on to [03:29] where she understands that when she's in [03:32] a sit front position I can say he'll and [03:35] she'll be able to flip her back end [03:37] right in the heel position with very [03:39] nice beautiful precision even though I'm [03:42] training her to be a service dog that [03:43] precision is still really nice and it [03:46] will help with the training and lastly a [03:48] lot of the stuff that I'm gonna be [03:50] teaching her it's for instructional [03:52] purposes only I want you guys to know [03:54] how to teach it so for example we're [03:55] gonna be teaching her scent detection as [03:57] well she's not gonna be a diabetic alert [03:59] dog but it is something that you would [04:01] need to know how to do if you were to [04:03] train a diabetic alert dog so we're [04:05] gonna be throwing in some really cool [04:07] things to help teach you guys a little [04:09] bit more how to train your own surface [04:10] dogs or how to train a service dog for [04:12] some [04:13] you know [04:17] if you have a metal bowl like this set [04:20] it down nicely [04:21] don't drop it because you don't want to [04:23] startle your young pup and then it's [04:26] gonna make it much more difficult to [04:27] teach the behavior again I'm just gonna [04:29] guide them on I'm waiting for those paws [04:31] to go onto the bowl and it helps to [04:34] teach the climb command first so you can [04:36] see as I said some dogs will avoid it [04:40] come on buddy come on [04:42] yes good job you only got one paw in [04:46] there that's all I really need for right [04:48] now I'm gonna guide them back around and [04:50] get them to get both paws on there yes [04:59] good so we got another Paul come on babe [05:02] come on come on come on you can do it [05:04] give him a little bit of encouragement [05:06] can't man you can do it buddy yes very [05:11] nice very nice good job excellent lots [05:16] of rewards there [05:17] let's guide them back on I'm actually [05:19] gonna remove the leash so it's not in [05:23] the way I come but good [05:44] come on babe good boy come on get me [05:48] give me wait [05:58] yes good good job very nice buddy so you [06:04] can see you starting to get it [06:06] come on buddy buddy buddy buddy good boy [06:08] scam to do it again come on you can do [06:17] it little man and each dog is gonna be a [06:28] little different I'm giving them a piece [06:39] here and there just cuz I don't want him [06:41] to get discouraged yes good boy he's [06:44] doing really nice yes reward and I'm [06:48] also gonna use the pivoting that I did [06:49] before to get him to pivot his rear end [06:52] on the boat yes good so that power [06:55] steering is already coming into play and [06:58] it's good to get our dog to be able to [06:59] pivot their back end again both [07:01] directions [07:06] the only difference from the power [07:08] steering is we're having him keep his [07:10] paws on the boat come on yes [07:19] I can help him a little bit yes yes good [07:27] job buddy [07:28] now I'm gonna get him to place his paw [07:31] on the bowl and I'm gonna use the [07:33] terminal marker great good boy [07:44] nice job nobody scam to come back good [07:47] boy come I come again free very nice [07:52] very nice he's already getting it good [07:54] week well you dropped it little me good [07:58] my money [08:01] you can do it [08:23] patience is key with this I'm gonna get [08:36] one more good one cuz he's getting tired [08:38] come on free very nice good job God boy [08:47] you did it so we're gonna do that with [08:50] each one of the dogs that were working [08:52] with to get them to understand that rear [08:53] and awareness but also to get them to [08:55] understand that place command because [08:57] we're gonna be able to use that place [08:58] command for some of our more advanced [09:00] obedience so this is a great exercise to [09:03] teach let me show you an example with a [09:05] little bit more of an advanced dog so [09:07] you can see the final picture it's been [09:10] quite a while since I've done this [09:11] exercise with her but you'll see once [09:13] they have it they'll retain it for a [09:15] long time [09:16] yes and she's already offering it up and [09:18] that's part of that proactive dog [09:20] training that we talked about before [09:22] place so she knows to walk right on it [09:25] and again if I pivot she's gonna pivot [09:27] with me and stay in that sit front [09:30] position I can try to go back the other [09:32] way [09:33] her other direction is not as good come [09:37] on baby there we go yes and the reason [09:41] why is because with her I mostly did the [09:43] left pivot because I would use this bowl [09:45] heel to work on that flip finish sit so [09:52] I can place my dog know sit place her [09:55] into a position and then call her heel [09:57] and the heel and you can see she uses [10:02] the bowl as a platform to pivot on this [10:05] is also a great target location heel if [10:09] I call her into heel position I can send [10:12] her place [10:16] to go on to the place command and again [10:18] even after not doing this exercise for a [10:21] long time [10:21] free she's still really really good at [10:24] it if you imprint your dog correctly [10:26] that first 16 weeks place so she went [10:32] for this Center please help her out a [10:34] little bit then it really sticks with [10:37] them for life again we teach them by [10:40] placing their paws on it we reward it so [10:42] free I'm gonna show you like when a dog [10:44] starts to learn it what it will look [10:46] like so she places free and then I [10:48] reward place a cure free then report [10:52] place free very nice place and then once [10:58] we have that place stay again we start [11:00] to pivot around getting our dog pivot [11:03] that back end nicely and I'm gonna show [11:07] you her doing this behavior right now [11:09] when she was a young puppy as well so [11:11] you can see how it looks and how they [11:13] can advance yes all right yes yes yes [11:40] girl yes [11:49] [Music]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 382/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] this is a command that I like to teach I [00:02] highly recommend it and it's called the [00:04] center command all we're going to do is [00:05] we're gonna take food I like to have [00:07] food in both hands and we're gonna guide [00:09] our dog around our body and in between [00:12] both of our legs so when I'm doing this [00:14] I have the food in both hands and I'm [00:16] using my right hand to guide my dog [00:18] around then I transfer my dog's nose to [00:21] my left hand so I'm not giving the dog [00:23] any food that's in my right hand I'm [00:25] gonna give the food that's in my left [00:26] hand so I got the dog around I transfer [00:28] them to my left hand once they're in [00:30] position yes reward then at that point I [00:32] can start rewarding with both hands but [00:34] as I'm teaching the dog how to get in [00:36] that position I'm not really feeding [00:40] them any food or I'm not feeding them [00:41] any food from my right hand just when [00:43] they get into position I start to reward [00:45] him I reward on my left and then I will [00:47] reward him with my right and then what [00:49] I'm gonna also do this is going to help [00:51] us with our focused heal so against our [00:54] dog comfortable again looking up and [00:56] walking forward so I do love this [00:58] command as far as helping with our [01:00] focused heal but it is also really fun [01:02] playful command that everybody loves it [01:05] the dogs have fun with it and I also use [01:06] it for playing fetch and things like [01:08] that I might tell the dog center then [01:09] get in position and then I throw the [01:11] ball so anyways we're gonna walk with [01:13] our dog in that position and we're gonna [01:15] reward them for looking up and [01:17] maintaining it and this is an easy way [01:19] to teach our dogs how to pivot in [01:21] position because we have our legs on the [01:24] left and right side of the dog so we're [01:25] a little pivot to our left we could [01:27] pivot to our right we can walk backwards [01:29] and by keeping them in the center [01:31] position this is going to help when we [01:33] transfer this over into the heel [01:34] position this is a great way to do this [01:37] it's a great command to teach your dog [01:38] and it's something that I highly [01:40] recommend once you can get the physical [01:42] cue just like everything else go ahead [01:44] and name that command I like to call it [01:46] Center so I say Center then I cue my dog [01:48] in a position yes rewarding I'm gonna [01:50] start giving it around and getting my [01:51] dog to understand and you can do this [01:53] with puppies as well here let me show [01:55] you how to train this exercise okay so [01:57] we want to teach our dog the center [01:59] command the center command is it's a fun [02:01] exercise so if you have a pet and you [02:03] just want you know that basic obedience [02:05] it's fun to do if you're using this for [02:07] competitive obedience this is gonna help [02:10] keep your dog's head up and it's also [02:12] gonna help with their back [02:13] to pivot around so what we want to do is [02:15] we want to put food in both our hands [02:17] I'm not going to give my dog the food [02:19] that's in my right hand I'm going to [02:21] give him the food that is in my left [02:22] hand but I'm gonna use that to guide him [02:24] around transfer him over to my left yes [02:28] reward yes [02:30] reward good boy so that's gonna be the [02:33] center position now when we feel like we [02:37] can get our dog yes to go there pretty [02:40] easily using our luring or food then we [02:46] can go ahead and we can name it okay so [02:48] we want to have our dog in front of us [02:50] we want to say Center and then we want [02:53] to cue our dog into that center position [02:55] yes [02:55] good and then what I like to do I like [02:58] to walk with my dog in that center [03:01] position walking around trying not to [03:05] drop food getting him to pivot around [03:07] and getting him used to being in that [03:09] position but you see how it makes it [03:11] easy with my legs to teach him how to [03:14] pivot around helps him with his body his [03:17] movement that those basic mechanics [03:19] break all right so let's do that again [03:21] good boy buddy so again Center guide him [03:27] using the food am i right but he's not [03:29] getting it then he gets the food in the [03:31] left and then we can go ahead we can [03:33] walk around even a young puppy like [03:36] Derby here just make sure you have [03:39] plenty of rewards good boy good job very [03:49] nice buddy and I like to do all kinds of [03:54] things that's been around in one [03:56] position I can walk forward and if I am [04:02] doing this for competitive obedience I [04:04] really want to work on keeping my dog's [04:07] head up so keeping their head up keeping [04:10] them used to walking looking up [04:13] come on bud you're gonna drop food every [04:17] now and then it happens good boy that [04:23] way that's gonna transfer into that [04:25] focus he'll with your dog keeping their [04:27] head up nice and high so again center [04:30] then the cue guide them around good boy [04:35] get them walking get them looking [04:37] upwards and get them used to moving and [04:41] pivoting in one spot oh then if you do [04:46] it correctly you'll be able to say the [04:48] command center and your dog will run [04:50] right into that center position Ari's [04:52] more of an advanced dog but I want you [04:53] to see what it's gonna start to look [04:55] like as your dog starts to understand [04:57] the center command center all right so [05:03] you see how she walks on her and she [05:04] looks directly up at me look now I tell [05:07] her walk when I want her to move in the [05:09] center command but you don't have to do [05:11] that it's whatever you want but again [05:13] I'm walking and I'm getting her used to [05:16] walking and looking up good girl very [05:19] nice [05:20] same thing I can now pivot around and if [05:24] I go down then she should go down come [05:27] back up walk good girl [05:31] again maintaining that position [05:33] maintaining that eye contact looking up [05:36] at me good and then we could get her do [05:40] a little bit of Revere sit down free all [05:54] right so that's gonna be an exercise I [05:55] want you guys to practice even if you're [05:57] doing basic obedience this is still [05:59] gonna add a lot of value to your [06:00] training center [06:06] yes [06:43] [Music] ==================================================

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 385/468,com/store === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] we want to teach our dogs how to walk [00:02] backwards continue developing that [00:04] rear-end awareness there's gonna be two [00:06] ways we're going to teach this the first [00:07] one is going to be using reward based [00:09] training [00:10] what I'm gonna do for this is I'm going [00:11] to have food in my hands if I open my [00:14] hands that's letting my dog know to come [00:17] to me if I close my hand that's gonna [00:19] teach my dog to back up now what you're [00:22] gonna find is sometimes when you go to [00:23] do this just like teaching the stand [00:25] command some dogs want to go into a sit [00:27] if they go into a sit Irene [00:30] so I'm gonna close my hand the second [00:31] the dog takes one step back I don't need [00:33] five steps or ten steps I just want one [00:36] step I get that one step I'm going to [00:38] use the terminal marker and they're [00:39] gonna come back and get the reward that [00:40] I'm gonna close my hand again walk [00:42] towards a dog they step back terminal [00:44] marker they jump forward they get [00:45] another piece of food and I'm gonna [00:47] continue to do this until my dog really [00:48] understands that when I have my fist [00:50] close I want them to walk backwards um [00:52] and have them walk back and a certain [00:54] amount of distance and then when they [00:55] get really good at it I'm gonna start [00:57] having them walk backwards on the [00:59] different items different platforms so [01:01] they can really develop that rear-end [01:02] awareness if you're really good at this [01:04] you can get your dog to walk backwards [01:05] upstairs get them to walk backwards on [01:08] to their climb bed get them to walk [01:09] backwards on whatever it is just to get [01:11] them used to be paying attention to [01:13] their rerender that that rear-end [01:15] awareness now we can also teach them to [01:18] walk backwards using leash pressure so [01:20] I'm gonna have the leash and the collar [01:22] on the dog and I want the leash to go [01:23] directly down their back and I'm gonna [01:26] pull straight back we have to be careful [01:28] not to pull up because if we pull up or [01:30] dogs gonna get confused and they're [01:31] gonna want to go into the sit so we want [01:33] to pull straight back once they feel a [01:35] little bit of tension they jump back we [01:37] mark and reward and we continue to do [01:39] this until I can start to walk or pivot [01:41] and my dog will walk backwards by [01:43] feeling that tension on their on their [01:45] collar this is gonna help with some of [01:47] our more advanced obedience if you're [01:49] going to be doing advanced obedience [01:50] with your dog I use this often to teach [01:52] my dog left about turn I use this to [01:55] teach my dog how to maintain heel [01:57] position if I'm going forward or [01:58] backwards there's a lot of ways we can [02:00] use this to really communicate [02:02] effectively with our dogs let me show [02:04] you how to teach it [02:05] okay we're gonna try the reward-based [02:07] training technique to get our little man [02:10] Derby here to walk backwards yes good [02:12] boy yes good off drop the piece right [02:18] here I got it I got it buddy [02:20] got your back like a boy this clothes [02:24] walking on yes good boy his clothes [02:28] walking them yes good yes excellent yes [02:34] very nice derby come on just laying down [02:43] yes good boy yes good yes good again we [02:52] can use the terminal marker free free [03:03] free good free excellent good job Derby [03:12] free very nice [03:18] free good and that's a really good [03:23] session with Derby here he's not quite [03:25] ready to name the command yet but when I [03:29] feel like he's really walking back and [03:30] he's doing it really nicely without [03:32] having to push in him like I am now then [03:35] I would go ahead and name it for him but [03:36] for right now that's gonna be a good [03:38] start so we want to teach our dog to [03:40] walk backwards this is going to be the [03:43] reward based style training technique [03:45] when we have our hand open that's a cue [03:48] for our dog to come to us when we have [03:51] our hands closed that's a cue for them [03:53] to walk away what I'm going to do is I'm [03:55] gonna place some food in my hand I'm [03:59] gonna place some food in my hand and I'm [04:00] gonna walk backwards I'm gonna reward my [04:02] dog now your dog should know to walk [04:05] into you because you've already done the [04:06] backwards follow exercise then as my [04:10] dogs walking to me I'm gonna close my [04:11] fist and walk towards my dog yes and [04:13] when my dog takes that jump back yes I'm [04:16] gonna mark and reward yes good [04:20] I can use my terminal marker to free oh [04:22] girl again fist close walk into our dog [04:26] free and as they get better you're gonna [04:29] be able to start getting them to walk [04:30] back farther and farther hands closed [04:34] and yes good hands closed walk into the [04:38] dog free you can see she knows that when [04:42] my hands are closed [04:43] that's when she walks backwards free [04:51] free when your dog becomes better with [04:56] this exercise what I like to do is I [05:01] like to teach them to walk on two [05:03] different platforms this is all part of [05:06] that body awareness that rear-end [05:08] awareness just like a gymnast doing [05:10] backflips they really have that [05:12] awareness when they're in the air that a [05:14] lot of other people that don't do that [05:15] type of training may not have so with [05:18] our dogs that are doing this advanced [05:19] obedience we really want to get them [05:21] aware of that backend and how to move [05:23] and how to I'm really maneuver so what [05:26] I'm gonna do with her is I'm gonna have [05:27] her walk backwards onto the climb bed I [05:30] like to have puppies climb up on [05:32] slightly elevated platforms for maybe a [05:34] little ramp for them to walk on whatever [05:36] it is just something to get them using [05:38] their back legs and thinking about it as [05:40] they walk back so let's see how she does [05:41] with this I'm gonna go nice and slow I [05:43] want her to reach for you're gonna see [05:45] she feels it she's trying to go around [05:49] yes good so you see how she reached back [05:52] to find her footing same thing I'm gonna [05:55] do it again freak good girl [05:58] very good and the more different [06:01] platforms you have them do this the [06:02] better and more aware they're gonna [06:04] become of their hind legs a cheater [06:12] freak good girl [06:16] freak very nice so I'm marking when her [06:20] back legs get on the climb bit free good [06:24] girl [06:26] free very good that's my good girl [06:30] that's my good girl and that's all we're [06:33] gonna teach our dog to walk backwards [06:35] using reward-based training again the [06:38] more you put into this the better it's [06:40] gonna help you with some of those more [06:41] advanced obedience exercises getting [06:44] them to walk up stairs doing things like [06:45] that this is especially helpful too if [06:48] you're doing something such as agility [06:50] training or things like that where you [06:52] really need your dog to be athletic okay [06:56] so we can name it with re as well back [07:03] sit back free good girl back free back [07:30] back back back back [07:51] free very nice so I don't have to use [07:54] the queue as much for her anymore [07:56] sit back come back dog that's heel back [08:11] free so have some fun with it if you [08:16] want put it on a name you don't really [08:17] have to name the backwards command it is [08:20] good to have a name for it but this is [08:22] going to be more so for your left about [08:24] turns and some of the other obedience [08:26] routines that your dog is going to have [08:28] to learn to really navigate through [08:30] having that rear-end awareness excellent [08:51] alright so he's doing it really nice [08:53] it's picking this up quickly very nice [09:12] little spit good boy excellent that's [09:25] cool all right so he's doing it pretty [09:27] nicely if I wanted to I could go ahead [09:30] and name the command if you want to do [09:31] something just like back up move back [09:34] moonwalk whatever you want the command [09:37] to be you can go ahead and do that very [09:39] simple we're gonna prep our food hands [09:43] and then we're just gonna say back up [09:46] then the Q free reward back up then the [09:52] Q free [09:57] back up and the cute free back up cute [10:05] free we just continue to do it until we [10:09] have our dog walking backwards on [10:10] command this close walking home free [10:14] good job buddy I got more it's okay free [10:21] free free nice job free excellent good [10:37] job hero swinging out a little bit try [10:42] to get him free to go straight again you [10:46] can always use a barrier so I'm noticing [10:48] he's

close my fist yes reward so I'm using [12:52] the reward based style to help teach the [12:56] pressure base tile [12:58] come on buddy yeah nice clothes yes [13:09] this opens gives them a treat close [13:10] pressure yes reward close pressure yes [13:26] yes good job [13:29] yes good boy [13:48] yes good boy little baby steps for the [13:52] little guy [13:52] yes good job buddy yes very nice [13:58] that's real good that's so good you did [14:00] it you did it [14:03] let's try it again let's try to get [14:06] buddy to me close my cup we lose my coop [14:12] we come in very good buddy [14:15] ahh dropping food closed fist [14:21] yes go ahead little steps don't need [14:23] much yes good boy [14:26] excellent my little man yes go ahead boy [14:30] watch his little teeth yes very nice [14:36] come on [14:37] yes go ahead boy yes good you can help [14:51] him with my foot keep his back end up [14:53] yes boy very good yes good yes [15:05] yes [15:15] yes job good job buddy buddy good boy [15:20] gimme yes good yes yes yes good boy [15:43] whoa with a puppy it's gonna take a [15:45] little bit more patience but they could [15:48] do it too huh buddy [15:49] good boy I will do a couple more with [15:53] him and it's not gonna be perfect the [15:57] very first time you do this exercise [15:59] with your puppy but really it's [16:01] important to be patient because they are [16:02] so young they are learning and we wanted [16:05] to be a good pleasant experience if [16:07] you're trying to do this exercise [16:09] because this is one that was proved to [16:11] be very difficult for my students in the [16:12] past if it's difficult you are getting [16:15] frustrated stop on a good note give your [16:18] dog a treat play have fun and then go [16:20] back and try it later because this is [16:22] again a more difficult exercise with [16:26] young for young puppies so again here we [16:28] go using my foot to prevent him from [16:30] sitting close my face a little bit of [16:32] pressure yes good boy [16:34] close my face a little bit of pressure [16:35] yes good job buddy [16:38] this pressure yes he's getting it good [16:40] job my little man yes good boy that was [16:44] very good Joey [16:46] very good who's my big boy come on come [16:50] on buddy good get a little bit of play [16:53] in there let's try this again good job [16:57] buddy [16:57] good yes very nice yes yes excellent yes [17:05] good boy yes good job good boy yeah [17:17] excellent good yes yes yes yes excellent [17:33] and that's a really good session [17:35] for him I don't want to keep pushing him [17:37] too much he's starting to walk backwards [17:40] he's feeling good about it that's a [17:42] great time to end that little exercise [17:45] all right so now we're gonna be teaching [17:47] our dog how to walk backwards using [17:50] leash pressure it's important that your [17:52] dog understands the basic concept of [17:54] following it when you bring it forward [17:56] sitting when you bring it up laying down [17:59] when you put pressure on it coming to [18:01] you so your dog should really understand [18:03] all these mechanics this one's a little [18:05] bit more difficult and what I like to do [18:07] is I like to bring my dog up against [18:09] some sort of barrier so here I'm just [18:11] using the railings and this is just to [18:13] prevent her from swinging her butt too [18:15] much and what I want to do notice I'm [18:18] not giving any commands to sit there all [18:28] right so I'm gonna bring the leash to [18:30] where the clip is directly behind her [18:33] neck in line with her spine and all I'm [18:37] gonna do is I'm gonna pull directly back [18:39] when you first start this you're gonna [18:41] get a little bit of resistance from your [18:43] dog the moment my dog jumps up I'm gonna [18:46] use my terminal marker and I'm going to [18:48] reward her so I'm not expecting her to [18:50] walk a very long distance so here we go [18:53] slight pressure free good girl [18:59] again slight pressure free very nice [19:06] we're gonna guide her back forward and [19:10] again sit sit [19:15] slight pressure good girl good at this [19:19] point you can keep on walking sit as far [19:26] as you would like them to down now she [19:29] makes it look easy but it could be [19:31] difficult with some dogs when you're [19:33] first starting out just really be [19:35] patient and reward each one of those [19:37] small wins you don't need them walking [19:39] back 20 feet the very first time you [19:42] attempt this just a little bit you [19:44] should be rewarding and I'm gonna show [19:46] you with a few different dogs so you can [19:48] see what I'm talking about [19:49] here's Charlie he's never done the [19:51] backwards exercise using leash pressure [19:54] so this should be a good example of [19:55] maybe some of the speed bumps you might [19:58] run into so again I think the leash [20:01] directly behind him and I apply a little [20:03] bit of pressure free good so that low [20:07] bounce that he did I'm gonna reward that [20:09] free okay so he's another really easy [20:12] dunk all right Charlie come on good boy [20:19] so against straight down this back [20:22] walking backwards so he's going into a [20:25] spin okay so he's running into some [20:27] issues he always gets so excited that [20:32] loves to train so we do pressure pack [20:34] free free free very nice [21:04] very good body free free so he's an [21:16] example of a pretty easy dog so that [21:18] went really well and I would just [21:20] continue to work in till he understood [21:21] it he wasn't trying to do little spins [21:23] or maybe some of the other behaviors [21:25] that he's been rewarded for in the past [21:27] okay same thing take the leash place it [21:30] behind him I got my rewards a little bit [21:34] of pressure same time stepping back with [21:36] him so he just shifted back a little bit [21:43] he didn't pop the putter but I'll still [21:45] take it chew your food again here we go [21:48] pressure free excellent if your timing [21:52] is on point your dogs are gonna learn [21:55] really fast so notice how when he makes [21:58] that movement that's when I'm saying [22:00] free I'm marking that behavior I'm [22:02] saying that's what I want you did it [22:04] correctly here's the reward so again a [22:06] little bit of pressure free good boy [22:10] free very nice buddy good they sat down [22:18] don't want that I want to stay standing [22:23] free good get the trick get all get all [22:27] that food I dropped don't drop food as [22:30] much as I do [22:32] three go ahead boy good boy coming buddy [22:37] good job then we're gonna get them to [22:41] walk backwards using that pressure free [22:49] free free very nice free good boy free [23:13] free let's do one more come on be good [23:29] great and also if you notice I allow my [23:36] dogs the opportunity to make mistakes [23:38] giving your dog the opportunity to make [23:40] mistakes and try again in the very [23:42] beginning is incredibly important you [23:45] don't want them to become worried about [23:46] making mistakes the more willing they [23:49] are to try and make a mistake the faster [23:51] they're going to learn [24:08] good one free a couple more steps free [24:13] very nice and you will run into your dog [24:19] trying to set in the very beginning [24:22] because the pressure back that way is [24:24] very similar to this pressure so really [24:27] be patient with that [24:29]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 388/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] teaching commands from a distance is [00:02] something everybody wants to be able to [00:03] teach their dog and it's something that [00:05] you need your dog to be able to perform [00:06] if you're doing any form of competitive [00:08] obedience especially a sports such as [00:10] French ring that has a change of [00:12] position exercise where you're far away [00:14] from your dog and all you can do is give [00:16] them verbal commands based on what [00:17] you're being told to give them sit down [00:19] and stand each position going into the [00:22] other position there's two ways that I [00:24] like to do this or really there's three [00:26] ways one is gonna be where I'm using [00:29] food to reward the dog so I'll stand in [00:31] front of my dog I have my dog on a climb [00:33] command I say sit I walk towards my dog [00:36] i cue my dog into position yes reward I [00:38] build distance again down I walk towards [00:41] my dog I used the food to cue the dog [00:43] into the position I keep doing this we [00:44] don't have to run towards a dog remember [00:46] the domino effect we give the command [00:48] then we move to execute the command with [00:50] our physical cue which is the dominoes [00:51] falling over we place the dog into [00:53] position we mark the reward that's the [00:55] last domino falling over we completed [00:57] the behavior we made the connection and [00:59] we keep doing that and we start to build [01:00] distance and before you know you give [01:02] the dog command before you even starting [01:03] to walk towards them they're already [01:05] going into position that's gonna be [01:06] using reward-based training and doing it [01:08] by yourself the next one is going to be [01:12] doing the exercise but using pressure [01:13] based training so just a leash so I have [01:15] a longer leash I say sit I cue the dog [01:18] they go into the sit yes reward I step [01:20] back down I cue the dog they go into the [01:23] position yes [01:24] reward and continuing to do this in [01:26] building this sense before you know it [01:28] you no longer need the long line one of [01:30] my favorite ways to do this is using a [01:32] helper so I have a helper with the dog [01:34] the dog already knows the leash pressure [01:36] I stand a certain distance away I simply [01:39] stand there I give the commands sit my [01:41] helper will cue the dog into the sit and [01:43] then I will say yes and they will reward [01:45] the dog for me and I will go through [01:47] each position with the dog at a distance [01:51] using my helper to help me get the dog [01:54] to understand this position this is a [01:55] great way to do it it's good to do all [01:57] of them though really if you're doing [01:58] competitive obedience because you want [02:00] your dog to understand that they have to [02:01] do the commands not just when somebody [02:04] is standing there making them do it you [02:06] want them to do it whether or not [02:08] somebody's standing there so let me show [02:10] you exactly how to start teaching your [02:11] dog commands from a dist [02:13] all right so for this exercise you want [02:15] to make sure you have an assistant and [02:17] this is going to do a couple things one [02:19] it's gonna help us teach commands from a [02:21] distance and number two it's going to [02:23] reduce the possibility of you messing up [02:25] your timing and the reason why this is [02:27] possible is I'm gonna be giving the [02:29] commands but she's going to be executing [02:32] the physical cue to get the dog to [02:34] perform the behavior I will be marking [02:36] the behavior and then she will be [02:37] rewarding Derby so it's a very simple [02:39] exercise I give the command she does a [02:42] cue I mark she rewards okay and I'm [02:45] gonna show you we're going to show you [02:46] how to do this so I'm gonna give her [02:49] some treats and you can start closer if [02:56] you want and build this since as your [02:58] dog gets better but I'm gonna stand here [03:00] and give command so Erika's ready to [03:02] execute the commands using the leash [03:04] pressure down yes good boy [03:11] and she's also there to reinforce now if [03:14] he makes a mistake good sit yes good job [03:21] bud no oh yes good boy [03:29] you want to come running over to me sit [03:33] yes [03:37] climb [03:41] yes good boy [03:43] Derby sit yes [03:51] no he has a tendency to really look for [03:54] pieces there we go now help them with [04:01] the food there we go good perfect down [04:14] then she does the cue yes then the [04:17] reward no good i boy sit yes [04:30] no oh yes say it fell to the crack [04:44] it's okay okay you guys are going to [04:46] drop food on occasions no big deal yes [04:57] down yes fine yes and then after you do [05:13] a low short session then go ahead and [05:15] switch positions just like this she's [05:21] gonna give the commands and I'm gonna [05:23] execute the physical cue yes oh wait [05:32] sorry see that she's supposed to say [06:40] [Music] [07:06] I'll then free so as you can see it's [07:10] really easy exercise and once again it [07:13] helps with giving the dog commands from [07:14] a distance and number two it reduces the [07:17] likelihood of you pairing your physical [07:18] with your verbal which will increase the [07:21] speed and what your dog learns these [07:22] commands sometimes you're not gonna have [07:25] a training partner to help you do a [07:26] change of position exercises from a [07:28] distance so we can start giving our dog [07:30] commands from a distance but we're gonna [07:32] want to start really close so what we're [07:34] gonna do is we're gonna start close to [07:37] our dog where our dog is used to hearing [07:39] our commands I like to either place my [07:41] dog on a back tie or place my dog on a [07:45] climb bed like re is right here so I'm [07:48] gonna block the Sun so it's not blasting [07:50] in her eyes and I'm going to give her [07:52] the command down and then I would give [07:55] her the cue and reward [07:58] sit than the queue and reward you can [08:00] see she's already doing it [08:01] but when you first started even if your [08:03] dog knows the commands from this [08:06] position when you're right up next to [08:08] them as you build distance it could be a [08:10] little confusing for them so once we [08:12] give the command we start with the [08:14] physical cue stand then I come in and I [08:17] help her come on yes sit [08:25] then the cue yes we work and each time [08:30] we're gonna build more distance down [08:33] then I would do the cue and build more [08:39] distance so what I'm gonna do for [08:42] instructional purposes we're gonna start [08:44] back up here just like in the other [08:46] video I'm gonna name these commands [08:49] using different colors so I'm gonna do [08:51] red blue and green again cuz I want you [08:53] to see how I would actually present the [08:55] physical cue had she not knowing the [08:57] commands as well as she does red yes [09:08] blue yes green yes building distance red [09:24] yes blue no [09:40] Green yes red yes [09:53] Green yes [10:01] blue yes green yes fine so we're gonna [10:22] keep giving the commands and helping out [10:24] as much as we need so our dog can start [10:26] to understand what it is we're asking [10:29] them to perform so eventually you can be [10:31] far away and you're gonna be able to [10:32] give your dog the commands and they'll [10:34] be able to execute them beautifully sit [10:40] stand down stand sit free and I was able [11:01] to teach her that using the technique [11:03] that I just showed you ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 391/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] come down come down on a recall this is [00:10] something you might see an AKC open [00:12] routine there's a couple other routines [00:14] that do this as well and this is where [00:16] you call your dog to you they tell you [00:18] to down your dog you tell your dog to [00:20] down then they tell you call your dog [00:22] and you call your dog to you you don't [00:24] want to do this too many times you don't [00:26] want to do one after another because [00:27] then your dog is going to anticipate [00:29] that down as they're coming to you it's [00:31] really gonna slow down their recall but [00:33] when we do start this I call the dog to [00:36] me [00:36] I saved down and so you want to make [00:40] sure that your dog knows commands from a [00:41] distance you want to make sure your dog [00:43] knows your markers you want to make sure [00:45] that all these different things that we [00:47] talked about before in place so your dog [00:49] starts to come towards you save down the [00:51] moment after you save down so it's down [00:53] you start walking towards your dog don't [00:56] walk away that encourages them to come [00:57] to you don't stand there they'll start [00:59] to low crawl so you walking towards them [01:01] once they get all four paws or not all [01:04] four paws once they're laying down then [01:06] you use your terminal marker and throw a [01:08] toy over their head behind them the [01:10] other way so they're coming to you you [01:12] say down they lay down you use a [01:15] terminal marker throw the toy over their [01:17] head they go back the way they just came [01:19] from to get the toy so then when you're [01:21] doing this your dog is anticipating the [01:23] reward we talked about reward placement [01:25] your dog is thinking about the reward [01:26] coming behind them and so when you say [01:28] down they're gonna drop way faster [01:30] without low crawling to you if while [01:33] you're training this exercise you have [01:35] the dog come to you every time at the [01:36] end and reward them there then you're [01:38] gonna get the dog that does the low [01:39] crawl so again they go into position you [01:41] use your terminal marker throw it over [01:43] their head and continue to do this until [01:44] they're laying down really nice and fast [01:47] and if you're having a hard time where [01:48] they're not stopping right away then [01:50] what you can do is you can have somebody [01:52] with a long line standing behind your [01:54] dog you say down they stop your dog [01:57] they don't correct your dog they just [01:59] add a little bit of tension getting your [02:00] dog to stop and lay down then a reward [02:03] and throw the toy over their head let me [02:05] show you exactly how to do this all [02:07] right we're gonna be doing the down on [02:08] recall remember first time we do this [02:10] we're gonna call our dog to us we're [02:12] going to give them the down command [02:13] once we give them the down command we [02:15] are going to start walking towards them [02:17] they're not going to want to go down the [02:19] first time that we do this when we walk [02:21] towards them the moment they go into the [02:22] down position we are going to use our [02:24] terminal marker and then we will throw [02:26] their toy over their head back the [02:28] direction they came from so it should [02:30] look like this now we're gonna do the [02:59] exercise again and remember we don't [03:02] want to do it too many times because [03:03] then they're going to anticipate it down [03:05] on recall every time you do a recall so [03:08] you want to mix it up and throw it in [03:09] every now and then it should be a little [03:12] bit better this time again we give the [03:17] command all right let's set her up to do [03:40] it again now this time to mix it up a [03:42] little bit I'm not going to do the down [03:45] on recall I'm gonna call her to me and [03:48] I'm gonna throw the toy behind me again [03:49] we don't want our dog to anticipate the [03:54] down on recall or else you're gonna have [03:55] a really slow recall so we want to mix [03:57] it up a little bit [03:58] come re out [04:09] and this is also a great way to speed up [04:12] your recall command so again I'm gonna [04:14] call her to me I'm gonna use the [04:16] terminal marker I'm gonna throw the ball [04:18] behind me this time come free good girl [04:29] come on re that threw her off a little [04:32] bit good come on nicely done all right [04:38] so I'm gonna do one more why I call her [04:40] to me that's thrown the ball behind me [04:43] come free nice job re [04:53] nice excellent alright here we go we're [05:03] gonna do another down on recall my [05:06] collar to me give her the down command [05:08] start walking towards her once she's in [05:11] position mark and reward [05:29] [Music] [05:41] all right so we're gonna shorten the [05:43] distance a little bit on this one and [05:47] we'll see if I can go through the entire [05:49] picture of what it's going to look like [05:53] if you are doing a down on recall it is [05:57] in the AKC open routine and what's going [06:02] to happen is you're going to call your [06:03] dog to you the evaluator will give you a [06:06] signal that's when you'll tell your dog [06:08] to down then the evaluator will give you [06:11] another signal that's when you will call [06:13] your dog to you into the sit front [06:15] position and then that will be the [06:17] completion of the exercise there may be [06:19] a flip finish in there as well but just [06:22] be aware of that the evaluator will [06:25] signal when to do moves part of the [06:27] exercise so again we stand in position [06:32] come down come [06:41] three good girl so she was a little [06:48] rocky at the end but that's okay that's [06:50] the down on recall command it's very [06:51] simple takes a little bit of time but [06:54] just work at it and you'll have it down [06:55] beautifully [06:57] [Music]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 394/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we're going to be [00:01] teaching our dogs of flip finishing the [00:03] by finish when we do competitive [00:04] obedience there's a position called the [00:06] sit front this is when our dog is [00:08] sitting directly in front of us as [00:10] straight as possible looking up at us [00:12] and what we have to do is we need to [00:14] take our dog from that sit front [00:15] position and get them into the heel [00:17] position heel position it could be a [00:19] little different depending on which [00:21] sport you're doing but basically it's in [00:23] the position directly to our left side [00:25] and their paw is aligned with the balls [00:28] of our feet this comes from hunting dogs [00:31] because the hunter would have the dog on [00:33] the left and the rifle or their weapon [00:35] on the right so that's why heel position [00:37] is on the left side the flip finish is [00:40] where our dog goes from directly in [00:41] front of us and flips into that heel [00:44] position and then the by finish is where [00:47] our dog goes from the sit front and they [00:49] go around us into heel position we're [00:51] gonna use Lorene to teach this behavior [00:54] it's quite simple to do you want to make [00:56] sure you go through the power-steering [00:57] video really understand how to get your [00:59] dog to follow the food in the hand where [01:01] you can manipulate the position as well [01:03] as the place command those are gonna be [01:05] initial steps to teaching this behavior [01:07] again very simple exercise you just need [01:10] to do a lot of them to really get the [01:12] dog to understand it you need to be [01:14] patient [01:14] remember this is dog training it should [01:16] be fun okay [01:17] teaching the flip finish and the v [01:19] finish what we want to do is we want to [01:21] guide our dog into that sit front [01:23] position we first teacher we're gonna [01:25] step back with our left leg guiding our [01:28] dog around back in the heel position and [01:32] doing what we can to get our dog and as [01:35] perfect of a heel position as possible [01:38] and then it's good to guide the dog back [01:40] to a sit front stepping forward with our [01:42] left leg guiding our dog around the leg [01:45] back into that sit front position just [01:48] like this okay so one more time left leg [01:51] goes back we guide the dog around and if [01:55] our dog's not in the heel position that [01:57] we like all we have to do is readjust to [02:00] make sure they are in that perfect [02:02] position or as close to perfect as [02:04] possible stepping forward with that left [02:06] leg guiding our dog back into the sit [02:08] front position yes reward and here we go [02:12] one less time [02:13] I know I said one time already but we're [02:14] gonna do one more stepping back with the [02:16] left leg guiding our dog around into [02:21] that yield position so she's a little [02:23] forging but that's okay it happens again [02:26] stepping four with the left leg back [02:28] around into that sit front position so [02:32] now the by finish when I first do it I [02:34] step back with my right leg I have food [02:36] in both hands i guide the dog to my [02:39] other hand and then I reward them when [02:41] they are in the heel position trying not [02:43] to drop food like I did right there so [02:46] again we have food in both hands I'm not [02:48] giving her any of the food that's in my [02:50] right hand I'm giving her the food [02:51] that's in my left hand so as I step back [02:55] she's not getting any of that food but [02:57] when she comes to my left hand that's [03:00] when I'm rewarding her and that's when [03:02] she's getting the food here we go one [03:03] more time stepping back with the right [03:05] leg guiding my dog around into perfect [03:09] heel position okay so once we have our [03:13] dog doing that we can start naming each [03:15] one of the commands come means the sit [03:18] front position or here or front whatever [03:21] you want to call it and then again heel [03:23] for the other commands so to demonstrate [03:25] naming the commands I'm gonna use colors [03:27] so we're gonna call it red blue green [03:30] keep it very simple because if I say [03:34] heel she's gonna flip in a position [03:36] before I start to do the physical cue so [03:39] I want you guys to see what it looks [03:41] like when we're first naming the command [03:44] red then the cue yes reward blue then [03:53] the cue [03:55] yes reward green then the queue yes [04:04] reward blue then the queue yes and then [04:12] as they get better at it when they're [04:15] going around my back from the by finish [04:17] I start to do it where I don't even step [04:19] my leg back so I'll say green and then [04:23] just guide them around just like that [04:26] freak let her jump up for the reward [04:29] bring her back to the SIP front we'll do [04:31] it again green gather around [04:38] yes reward blue guide her to the front [04:45] yes a little cricket there I'll adjust [04:51] normally we want the dog to adjust to us [04:54] not us adjust to the dog red then the [04:58] cute and as you can see she's already [05:00] starting to get it even though I just [05:02] started naming at these different colors [05:05] blue yes red and there we go now she [05:17] knows the flip finish break off of the [05:20] word red but that's the process you have [05:22] to use say the word show them the cue [05:25] alright remember stepping back with that [05:28] left leg guiding our dog into heel [05:30] position if they're not in perfect heel [05:32] position readjust tie it around the body [05:36] to get them to the SIP front and tie it [05:38] around the body to get them back into [05:40] the heel position do this correctly and [05:43] you're gonna have a really nice flip [05:44] finish and a by finish make it fun and [05:47] do tons of repetitions [05:57] yes yes yes yes yes yes go ahead and [06:29] name it [06:29] come yes [06:35] bye yes come yes [06:49] heal [06:52] yes come yes [07:01] bye yes come yes [07:14] he'll yes come guess he'll nights I [07:28] messed up there I'll come out again [07:30] he'll free you might get a little bit of [07:37] that have you been doing our proactive [07:39] style training were you're doing the [07:42] free shaping during the day you're [07:43] rewarding your dog for offering up [07:45] behaviors often if you do that quite a [07:48] bit [07:49] your dog will do a little bit what [07:50] Charlie did right there he said I'm not [07:52] quite sure what that word is but maybe [07:55] if I try this he'll give me a reward and [07:57] I like when a dog does that because it [07:59] shows me they're putting in an active [08:01] effort to do what it is that I'm asking [08:03] for I'm not gonna reward him because he [08:05] made a mistake but I'm also not gonna [08:07] correct it I want to just show him what [08:09] it is that I want him to do and go [08:11] through more repetitions so he [08:12] understands that command and what it is [08:14] I'm trying to get him to perform [08:16] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 397/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] but in today's video we're going to be [00:06] teaching our dogs to send out command [00:08] this is something that you will see [00:10] often in competition obedience but it's [00:12] also fun exercise to teach your dogs a [00:15] lot of times I'll use this when I'm [00:16] playing fetch with my dogs I can tell [00:18] them to run they take off and then I [00:21] throw the ball over their head and it's [00:23] a great way to add a little bit of [00:24] mental stimulation to that physical play [00:26] so let's go ahead and jump right into [00:28] the training okay for the send out I'm [00:32] gonna take my phone that's gonna be the [00:33] target and I'm gonna place it right here [00:38] I'm gonna bring my dog over r-e [00:42] sit I'm gonna take a piece of food and [00:45] I'm at nope sit and I'm gonna place it [00:47] on there and let her see it now the [00:51] young puppy I'm gonna have to hold him [00:53] back he'll oh my god her into the heel [00:56] position and then I'm gonna aim with my [00:59] hand to the food and then I'm gonna give [01:03] her her run command so it's gonna be [01:05] runner her send out and I'm gonna point [01:07] all the way to the food a puppy you're [01:08] gonna have to really send it she's just [01:10] gonna run directly to it but I'm gonna [01:12] say run and then pointer to it then [01:15] we're gonna build a little bit of [01:16] distance if you're doing this by [01:18] yourself sit you're gonna want to have a [01:22] good sit stay again placing the food and [01:25] this is an accelerated version of how [01:27] this is going to look when I'm doing [01:29] this exercise with a young puppy it's [01:31] going to take much longer and you're [01:33] gonna see that next when I do that with [01:35] Derby so she broke her sit stay but [01:38] that's okay we all make mistakes right [01:40] re I'm gonna aim [01:42] run and then walk her to it good girl [01:45] bring her back come on baby using my [01:52] informal come one call [01:57] placing another piece of food on the [02:00] target walking back to my dog remember [02:03] if your dog has a tendency to spin hand [02:05] in front of their face as you walk [02:07] around run [02:10] so by pointing it's teaching my dog to [02:13] run in the direction of my hand building [02:16] a little bit more distance coming back I [02:25] have some food in my hand [02:27] so again if our dog likes to pivot [02:29] around run yes good so we're gonna do [02:38] the full distance right now climb I [02:43] could actually leave her on the climb so [02:46] that's a good way to do this as well [02:48] place your dog on the climb command I [02:50] set down some more food now I'm gonna go [02:55] the full distance now if your dog gets [03:00] confused if you tell your dog to run and [03:03] your dog stops halfway all you're gonna [03:06] do is you're gonna go with your dog and [03:08] try to almost in a sense race them to [03:10] the food to show them where it is [03:12] second that they stop because you want [03:14] them running all the way [03:16] all right heal so again we aim run good [03:25] girl free let her come back and jump to [03:28] get food out of my hand come on hurry [03:30] nice work and that's gonna be the start [03:33] of the send out so now we're gonna go [03:36] out to a field and I'm gonna show you [03:38] what it's gonna look like when we start [03:40] to use a toy to continue that speed and [03:43] really get them running out there okay [03:45] so we're gonna do send out with the [03:46] puppy so I'm gonna place the food on [03:49] we're gonna start nice and close and I'm [03:51] using a bigger platform for the puppy it [03:53] makes it easier for them good boy then [03:55] I'm gonna aim run and then I'm gonna [03:58] guide them to it yes good boy very nice [04:04] bring them back reload [04:07] everybody good boy I like to spin them [04:11] around in the heel run and then guide [04:15] them to it yes good boy come on buddy [04:22] it's very nice and if you can you could [04:27] always have a training partner help with [04:29] this come on buddy sit yes [04:44] run and I'd like to say run when they're [04:48] looking come on all the way to it yes [04:51] good boy good boy [04:54] come on buddy buddy good sit if you want [04:59] this could be an opportunity to work [05:01] you're nope to work you're sit stay good [05:24] boy [05:26] it's on the boat every time come on [05:29] buddy buddy sit yes No [05:43] yes run good we yes very nice very nice [05:59] come on buddy buddy yes no yes run yes [06:29] good boy good boy boy run yes good boy [07:19] no no run come on buddy [07:47] yes very nice good job yes good good boy [07:58] yes [08:14] run boy go boy [08:27] very nice good job buddy [09:03] [Music] [09:21] most dogs usually enjoy this exercise [09:39] free very nice so I would continue to do [09:44] this until I can bring them out I don't [09:47] even have to show them that there's food [09:48] over there I tell him run and he runs [09:50] over remember the dog always has to [09:52] believe that there's something out there [09:54] for them whether its food or a toy to [10:11] throw the ball over their head in the [10:13] direction that I want the dog to run [10:14] remember when we're training this we [10:16] always want something of value out in [10:18] the direction we're sending our dog so [10:20] we can get that maximum speed so I'm [10:28] just gonna let her walk with me and she [10:30] wants to walk in heels you can [10:39] don't and I'm gonna take the toy and I'm [10:42] gonna set it down make sure my dog can [10:44] see it [10:45]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 400/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:01] yes yes this is actually much easier to [00:06] teach than you may think so the two ways [00:09] that we're going to be teaching this is [00:10] one using reward-based training and the [00:13] other one using pressure based training [00:14] so with the reward based training [00:16] there's certain things you already have [00:18] to have in place one the dog already has [00:20] to know the markers the dog already has [00:22] to know all the commands on verbal alone [00:24] so your dog must know sit and your dog [00:26] must know down your dog must know come [00:28] on the verbal and we're gonna use the [00:30] concept of predictability to help teach [00:32] the dog these behaviors with the hand [00:35] signals so what we're going to do is [00:37] we're gonna have our dog in front of us [00:38] we're gonna show him the hand signal [00:40] then we're gonna give the command okay [00:43] so I would do this down yes reward [00:49] sit yes [00:51] reward as you can see the signal comes [00:55] before the verbal and after enough of [00:57] those the dogs can start to learn or [01:00] predict the pattern they go every time [01:01] you raise your hand the next thing you [01:03] say is down I go into the down I get my [01:05] reward right when you really start to [01:07] understand this concept of [01:08] predictability and pattern recognition [01:10] you can use this in your training and it [01:13] makes it so much easier there's no [01:15] conflict there's no miscommunication [01:16] with the dog so again all we're going to [01:19] do is we're gonna give the physical cue [01:20] then we're gonna say the command sit [01:22] then we're going to reward our dog we [01:24] give the physical cue down then reward [01:27] and make sure it goes in that order now [01:30] the way that we can teach this using [01:31] leash pressure is we have the leash in [01:33] our hand our left hand and all we're [01:35] going to do is we're gonna bring our [01:36] hand up and then down on the leash [01:38] pushing the dog into the down position [01:40] yes reward then with the sit we're gonna [01:43] go out and then we're gonna come up and [01:45] lift the dog up into the sit position [01:47] yes reward okay so again we give this [01:50] signal down yes and then we go and we [01:56] reward our dog so we're using the [01:59] concept of predictability to teach a [02:01] complex behavior your dog has to already [02:04] know the verbal commands from a distance [02:06] in order for this to work so we give the [02:08] cue [02:10] sit yes and then the command immediately [02:14] afterwards so if you think about that [02:16] concept of predictability or pattern [02:18] recognition the dog will start to say oh [02:21] every time you bring your hand up in the [02:22] air the next thing you do is you give me [02:24] the command to go into the down so I'm [02:26] just gonna do that anyways [02:27] and let's see off this one session if [02:29] she can start to figure it out down yes [02:41] sit yes down yes she's trying she's [02:54] thinking about it come yes [03:06] climb good down yes sit yes down yes sit [03:43] yes down yes yes very nice so she got to [04:02] sit there that was beautiful damn yes [04:10] baby sit yes we want to make sure we say [04:19] the command after we give that physical [04:22] cue down yes yes yes [04:52] sit yes down yes now we can use pressure [05:07] based training to teach this as well so [05:10] all I'm gonna do stand in front of my [05:12] dog have the leash in the center of my [05:15] body bring my hand up and then down on [05:18] the leash yes and then rewarded for this [05:24] sit we're gonna bring our hand out and [05:27] then up yes and then reward yes [05:43] yes good girl yes very nice yes good yes [06:09] yes yes yes yes good girl yes yes [06:51] yes yes yes fine yes good yes yes yes [07:34] very nice sorry and then if you want to [07:37] teach to come you're gonna hold the [07:39] leash in your right hand use your left [07:41] hand swipe around guide the lesions yes [07:49] climb again [07:53] hold the leash in your right hand [08:02] very nice [08:12] yes yes yes yes free very good and as [08:53] you can see in such a short session [08:56] she's already starting to someone [08:59] understand these hand signals by using [09:01] these two different techniques so do it [09:04] just like this be patient and you'll [09:06] have your dog executing these commands [09:08] in no time [09:10] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2020-04-10_Problem_Solving_Game_for_You_and_Your_Dog_.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 406/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] this video is part of a series and to [00:02] get the most out of the training I would [00:03] recommend watching them in order many of [00:06] the questions that you may have while [00:07] watching my videos can often be answered [00:09] in videos released prior alright in [00:22] today's video we're gonna be introducing [00:24] the stay command remember I do not use [00:27] the word stay once I place a dog into a [00:30] verbal commanded position it is required [00:32] that they maintain that position all [00:37] right and it's gonna be very simple what [00:39] we're going to do is we're gonna [00:40] commander onto the position I always [00:42] start with the climb command when I'm [00:43] first teaching a snake each climb [00:46] command or each state command rather has [00:49] a different level of difficulty than the [00:52] other one so for example the climb [00:54] command for me and my experience is the [00:56] easiest day to teach then the next one [00:58] would be the down then after that maybe [01:00] the same and then the stand say or the [01:04] heel stay or the center stay they become [01:07] more difficult depending on what [01:08] exercise we're doing so I always like to [01:10] start with the climb stay now higher the [01:12] climb is the easier it is for the dog to [01:14] understand that that's the position you [01:16] want them to maintain so this is how I'm [01:18] going to do it and I do the same way [01:20] with every single stay command that I'm [01:22] teaching the dog I place them in the [01:24] position I used my continuation marker [01:26] if we're rewarding the behavior because [01:28] I want them to continue the exercise so [01:30] in her case it's going to be the yes [01:32] word then I'm going to walk away as long [01:35] as the dog stays in the position I'm [01:36] going to reinforce it by saying yes and [01:39] rewarding the dog with a piece of food [01:40] so instead of saying stay a bunch of [01:43] times as I walk away I'm gonna walk away [01:45] casually or how I would if I was [01:47] normally walking and then I'm gonna go [01:49] back and reward the dog by using my [01:51] continuation marker you'll see exactly [01:53] what I mean if my dog or if partly [01:55] breaks the position I say one no I [01:58] calmly walk back to our cheese's she [02:02] bumped [02:04] I say OneNote I calmly walk back to her [02:06] I grab the leash and I place her back on [02:09] the climb state and I will do this as [02:11] many times as it takes when we're doing [02:13] this we want to make sure that we're not [02:15] yelling we're not getting excited we're [02:17] not running towards the dog [02:19] I want to make sure that my dog is at a [02:21] clear mental state I don't want them to [02:23] be startled by what that I'm doing so I [02:25] want to make sure it's a very calm [02:27] relaxed training session and that's [02:29] going to help them learn more quickly so [02:32] you'll see exactly what I mean right now [02:34] when I started with Harley and I've [02:36] never done a stay with her yet so Harley [02:38] baby so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna [02:43] tell her gone then the cue yes so I use [02:49] yes this time and not free so she [02:51] maintains it yes [02:53] I'm gonna reward by using continuation [02:55] marker [02:59] oh so there's my OneNote I grab the [03:02] leash I bring her back on good girl now [03:05] when the dog breaks the position and I [03:08] put them back on [03:09] I don't reward them right away I want to [03:11] wait a few seconds before I reward them [03:13] like I just now did because if you [03:15] reward them right away some dogs will [03:18] learn break the position yes get back on [03:21] get a tree break the position get place [03:23] back on get a tree so I just know so I [03:26] don't want to reward them run away [03:28] meaning like right now I wouldn't want [03:30] to reward her cuz then she might offer [03:31] up mistake a break in the position in [03:35] order to get rewarded so you see what [03:37] I'm doing I'm saying no math she breaks [03:40] the position calmly grabbing the leash [03:42] bringing her back on good girl let her [03:45] know she's doing it correctly if I ever [03:47] sustained yes now you use my [03:50] continuation marker even reward no one [03:53] know when she makes a mistake [03:54] bring her back on good girl what I know [03:59] I also like to know and you're gonna [04:03] have it where they're gonna break a few [04:04] times and I also like to do it when I [04:06] drop the leash yes that reward yes no a [04:13] milk an overriding us so if you say no [04:17] if you say yes and your dog breaks the [04:19] position don't reward them then no and [04:23] the reason why I like to do it this way [04:25] is I like the dog to learn no their best [04:28] course of action when they break a [04:30] position yes [04:32] Oh see I rewarded too early I got [04:34] distracted talking so don't don't make [04:35] that mistake but I want the dog to learn [04:38] when I say no yes their best course of [04:41] action is to either stop what they're [04:43] doing or go back to the previous [04:45] position yes good girl so she's already [04:48] starting to figure it out yes [04:52] [Music] [04:59] no and you should sound like a broken [05:01] record when you say no it should sound [05:03] the same just like everything else we [05:05] want our words to be as consistent as [05:08] possible yes girl very nice no the most [05:16] important thing no with dog training is [05:18] a clear communication as well as trust [05:22] yes [05:23] she shouldn't be afraid of me when I say [05:25] the word no all it is no it's just [05:29] letting her know I'm gonna come back and [05:31] I'm going to place her back in the [05:33] position she was just in yes very nice [05:38] yes good girl no also notice I don't [05:47] repeat the word no I don't say no no no [05:51] a bunch of times because I want the dog [05:53] to know that when I say no I'm [05:55] pinpointing a moment in time when the [05:58] dog has made a mistake if I keep saying [06:00] the word then what am i pinpointing if [06:03] the dog breaks the position and I say no [06:05] and the dog tries to correct themselves [06:06] and I say no again I'm like let's [06:08] incorrect and they try this no no no I [06:10] and they become stressed out we want to [06:13] make sure that we say it yes [06:15] the moment they make one mistake and [06:17] then we help them fix that mistake yes [06:19] no boom now is she's starting to go back [06:22] into the position and that's exactly [06:24] what we want good girl very nice good [06:28] job yes yes my good sweet girl and again [06:32] each time I walk away no and this is all [06:35] about showing her a very very clear [06:37] picture [06:38] we got the leash honor you get that [06:41] fixed [06:42] yes good girl looks like she has a [06:44] little bandana I'm not bandana that's [06:47] one little workout straps good girl [06:51] no yes [07:04] yes same thing with the yes when I'm [07:08] walking away I like to say yes then I [07:11] turned and I come back and I reward the [07:14] dog I don't want to get into a habit of [07:16] walking towards the dog and saying yes I [07:19] don't want to do this I don't want to go [07:20] yes because me turning then becomes the [07:24] cue [07:25] I want my marker to be the indicator yes [07:27] but the behavior is correct and then I [07:30] walk back and reward no thanks oh she's [07:35] starting to figure out that she needs to [07:37] fix herself yes laughter I say the word [07:40] no and you see this isn't creating any [07:43] stress there's no confusion [07:45] there's no anxiety yes she knows exactly [07:47] now not exactly but she's getting there [07:50] what I want her to do and it's as simple [07:52] as her yes [07:53] maintaining that position and I'm just [07:56] gonna keep rewarding her for holding [07:58] that position no good girl [08:05] yes so once I have this down and she [08:09] knows that she needs to maintain this [08:11] position then I would take this day to [08:14] the next exercise which would be the [08:15] down once I get the down really nice the [08:18] next one I would do is to sit so on so [08:20] forth we want to go through each command [08:22] and exercise and because yes she starts [08:25] to understand the concept on the first [08:26] exercise it makes the more difficult [08:28] stays easier to teach because you've [08:31] already laid the foundation yes what if [08:34] the climb stay so again all done open [08:37] baby break [08:42] how good it works baby good girl very [08:45] nice so those are the things you want to [08:48] keep in mind with this exercise you want [08:50] to make sure your dog knows a [08:51] continuation marker you want to make [08:54] sure you can get them back into the [08:55] commanded position by using the leash [08:57] and then you want to just be very calm [09:00] relaxed using you can use whatever word [09:03] you like if you don't like to say the [09:04] word know some people say wrong some [09:07] people say incorrect some people say [09:10] uh-uh or whatever it is as long as [09:14] you're consistent with that sound then [09:16] it should be pretty easy for your dog to [09:18] learn what it is you want them to do so [09:20] that's going to be our stay command I [09:23] hope you guys enjoy the video make sure [09:24] you leave a comment and we'll see you on [09:26] the next one [09:27] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 409/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] alright guys it's time to change the [00:01] narrative now is it better to have a [00:03] submissive dog where's it better to have [00:04] a confident dog well a lot of people [00:06] think that it's better to have a [00:07] submissive dog we've heard it before you [00:09] should have a calm submissive dog you [00:11] should be the assertive pack leader and [00:13] in order to do that one of the [00:15] techniques and a lot of people use is [00:16] what's called alpha rolling what they do [00:18] is they take the dog if you don't know [00:19] what alpha rolling is and they hold the [00:21] dog on the back waiting for the dogs to [00:23] submit now people think that this makes [00:26] them the pack leader [00:28] it shows the dog that they are the [00:30] confident assertive pack leader and [00:32] they're willing to take charge but this [00:34] isn't correct what it actually does is [00:36] it loses trust from your dog and it [00:40] diminishes the relationship but it makes [00:42] the dog go through a certain process in [00:44] their mind do they fight do they fly or [00:47] do they submit first option if they can [00:49] is flight but since you're holding them [00:51] in a position they're unable to fly so [00:53] the next one is fight which some dogs [00:54] will do they will fight once they [00:56] realize they can't win the fight then [00:58] they submit now most aggression comes [01:01] from fear or insecurities think about [01:04] the bully growing up when you're a [01:05] little kid was that person really [01:07] confident [01:08] or were they masking their insecurities [01:10] by being a bully and this is the [01:12] impression that people get from somebody [01:14] who is being a bully and it's the same [01:15] for our dogs you're gonna become a bully [01:18] you're not going to be a pack leader and [01:21] you're gonna be taken away the trust [01:22] that you do have with your dog and [01:23] you're gonna be destroying the [01:24] relationship so contrary to popular [01:27] opinion it's not about creating the [01:29] submissive dog but rather creating the [01:31] confident dog the dog that knows how to [01:34] navigate within the human world in ways [01:36] that other dogs don't one of the best [01:38] examples of this is the movie bolt if [01:41] you haven't seen yet it's a great movie [01:43] and I highly recommend taking the time [01:45] to go watch the movie but what they do [01:47] is they take this dog in the movie and [01:49] they make the dog believe that it's a [01:51] super dog they make the dog think that [01:53] it has a super bark they make the dog [01:56] think that it can run really fast at it [01:58] dog and then I could do things that are [02:01] considered impossible for the normal dog [02:03] but this dog believes with every single [02:06] fiber in his body that he is a super dog [02:08] and because of this he's incredibly [02:11] confident a dog that is really confident [02:14] is going to be way less likely to be [02:16] aggressive they're going to learn faster [02:19] and they're gonna have a much better [02:21] quality of life and the way that you do [02:23] this is the same way you would try to [02:25] build a young kids confidence how would [02:28] you do that if you're trying to teach a [02:29] kid a new martial art so you're just [02:31] going to beat them up the entire time or [02:32] you're gonna show them how effective his [02:34] techniques are you're gonna work with [02:35] them and build them up or build her up [02:37] whatever the case is we want to show [02:39] them that they are capable of doing [02:41] something and we do that with our dogs [02:44] so for example if I'm playing tug with [02:46] my dog I'm not gonna rip the tongue away [02:48] and show the dog how big and strong I am [02:50] that's not gonna help my dog in the [02:52] training but what I am gonna do is I'm [02:54] gonna show the dog how tough they are [02:55] when my dog jumps into me and I had the [02:57] tug toy and they push I'm gonna fall [02:59] back when they shake the toy I'm gonna [03:00] get thrown to the side and my dogs gonna [03:03] go wow I did that and then we're gonna [03:05] plan I'm gonna continue to build the dog [03:07] up and again if you do this if you treat [03:10] your dog like a super dog they will [03:12] become a super dog so again let's get [03:15] rid of that old narrative it's not about [03:17] creating the submissive dog but rather [03:19] creating a confident dog a dog that [03:22] knows how to navigate within the human [03:24] world in ways that other dogs down [03:27] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2020-04-21_Easily_Teach_Your_Dog_The_Drop_It_Command_.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 412/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in this video we're going to be going [00:01] over three common techniques used to [00:04] teach our dogs to drop it in today's [00:18] video we're gonna be teaching our dogs [00:19] the dropping command now in this video [00:21] we're gonna be using three different [00:23] techniques in order to teach that [00:24] behavior we're gonna be implementing the [00:26] science of dog training and every single [00:28] one of these techniques and the [00:30] technique is really going to determine [00:31] which one works best for you and your [00:33] dog or that's going to be the technique [00:35] that you're going to use so the first [00:37] two we're gonna be doing value transfer [00:38] this is where we offer up something else [00:40] in order to get the dog to release the [00:42] item now when we're teaching any [00:44] behavior that we want our dog to perform [00:46] remember we always have to present some [00:48] sort of physical cue that can get the [00:51] dog to perform the behavior that we want [00:53] so in this case we want the dog to [00:54] release the item that they have now [00:56] these techniques will not work if your [00:59] dog would rather have the item that they [01:01] already have in their mouth and that's [01:03] when we would go to option C this is [01:05] where we implement leash pressure and [01:06] I'm going to show you guys exactly how [01:07] to do that as well with Charlie here [01:09] we're gonna be doing value transferring [01:11] we're gonna be using food so we're gonna [01:13] play tug with him when I'm ready to get [01:15] him to release the item I'm gonna stop [01:17] the game I'm gonna stop moving the [01:20] moment I stop moving I'm then going to [01:22] pull out some food and show him that I [01:24] have food the moment he releases the toy [01:27] I'm gonna use my terminal marker I'm [01:29] going to then give him the food and then [01:31] we're gonna go back to play once I know [01:33] I can get him to release the toy every [01:36] single time I bring out food then I [01:38] would name the command and it has to go [01:40] in this order just like every other [01:41] thing that would teach your dog's [01:42] command motivate mark reward so I'm [01:45] playing tug I stop moving I then say out [01:48] I then grab my food offer it to the dog [01:52] Charlie here once he releases I then use [01:55] my terminal marker and I give him the [01:57] reward you want to make sure you do not [01:59] say your drop it or out command at the [02:02] exact same time you don't want to go up [02:05] because then you're pairing your [02:07] physical with your verbal and the dog is [02:08] never going to learn the actual outcome [02:10] and so it [02:11] Schoolnet now I'm going to demonstrate [02:12] with Charlie here okay so I'm going to [02:14] use this terminal marker to release him [02:17] into play [02:18] you could also teach your dog get it or [02:21] something like that where they know [02:23] they're now allowed to get the toy but [02:25] for me again I'm just gonna use a [02:26] terminal marker telling him he's been [02:28] doing his climb stay nicely and he can [02:30] now come get his reward free there you [02:35] go so he knows free he can come and play [02:38] that's my good boy Charlie that's my [02:41] good boy very good I want to play a [02:43] little bit have some fun with him [02:45] excellent so now I want him to release I [02:47] stopped moving then food [02:49] he gets the food goes back to the toy [02:53] good job good job so can we stop moving [02:57] food comes out he gets the food and he [03:01] goes back to the toy excellent so he's [03:03] doing really well [03:04] so I know that I can get him to drop the [03:06] item every single time so now I'm gonna [03:08] name stopped out so of course he did it [03:12] I gave him the food and then we go back [03:14] to play [03:15] I missed the Freak I miss saying the [03:17] marker so let me do what I'm not [03:19] explaining so if I was just playing with [03:21] my dog good boy Charlie [03:23] very good oh and I should have said [03:28] three I'm messing up let me try again [03:30] guys I'm not perfect good boy good job [03:34] oh three he's just doing it so quickly [03:38] I'm not able to get the food out before [03:40] he lets go and that's what we want that [03:42] shows us free that he knows the command [03:46] look we get it Lee he knows the command [03:48] and I can get him to do it on the verbal [03:51] look so stop moving out free reward and [03:54] he goes back to enjoy a good boy Oh fun [03:59] so now the next step once we have it [04:02] where they're doing exactly what [04:04] Charlie's doing he's releasing the item [04:07] before I have the food out so that shows [04:10] us that he knows the drop in command and [04:12] for him it's out so now we're gonna do [04:15] the next step the next step is we stop [04:18] moving we say out the moment our dog [04:21] releases the item we use our terminal [04:23] marker [04:23] and we allow them to re-engage with the [04:26] exact same toy so it should look like [04:27] this great good boy buddy so much fun [04:38] then we're gonna go free very nice [04:57] good boy oh you dropped out on your own [05:04] and then once you get your dog before me [05:08] just like that then you can offer up a [05:11] different reward or con or you can do [05:16] something different you can go into some [05:17] obedience and then you can incorporate [05:19] the toy and your obedience or take a dog [05:22] I'll walk or something like that but the [05:24] most important thing is you don't want [05:26] to take the toy away from your dog every [05:30] single time you tell them out because if [05:32] you do that they're gonna teach your dog [05:34] that out means the toy is gone and the [05:37] game is over [05:37] so you want to make sure they know that [05:39] the game can continue going on out [05:41] doesn't always predict that the game is [05:43] over so keep that in mind but that's [05:45] going to be how we're going to do the [05:47] first strategy or the first technique of [05:49] offering up food to get our dog to [05:52] release the toy now let's jump into the [05:54] second technique for both option a and [05:56] option B the process is going to be the [05:59] same the only thing that's going to be [06:00] different is an option a we're going to [06:02] offer food and an option B we're gonna [06:05] offer another toy now when you do this [06:06] you have to make sure the toys are [06:08] exactly the same you want them to be [06:09] equal value if one toy is more valuable [06:12] than the other toy we're gonna find it's [06:13] more difficult to get your dog to out [06:15] into that toy so again both of equal [06:17] value the way we're going to do this is [06:19] the same that we did with the food I'm [06:21] going to play with her with the one toy [06:22] once I want her to release it I'm gonna [06:24] stop the play stop the movement bring [06:27] out the new toy once she lets go the old [06:29] toy if I'm fast enough I'm going to use [06:31] my terminal marker and then let her have [06:33] the new toy and we're going to play with [06:34] that one and I'm going to go back and [06:36] forth [06:36] once I know I can get her to release the [06:38] item every single time I bring out the [06:40] new toy that I'm going to name the [06:42] command just like everything else I [06:44] stopped moving I say out then I bring [06:47] the new toy out she bites a new toy and [06:49] we go back into play she knows that I'm [06:52] offering up the new toy so more likely [06:54] did not she's gonna get to the new toy [06:56] before I use my terminal marker but [06:59] we'll see how it goes so I'm gonna take [07:02] this one I'm gonna put it in my best and [07:07] then I'm gonna start the play with this [07:09] one so the layered dog come and play [07:11] with the toy you can do what I do where [07:13] I'm just gonna use her terminal marker [07:15] but you can also teach your dog a get it [07:17] command or something like that and the [07:19] way that I teach that is I say the [07:21] command and then I move in a very [07:24] engaging way that's letting my dog know [07:27] based on my movement that I want her to [07:29] come play so for example I'm gonna use a [07:31] word that I never use I'm gonna say [07:33] pizza so if you're trying to teach your [07:35] dog to come and play with the toy this [07:37] is just for demonstration purposes only [07:39] but I would just go pizza and I'm a good [07:42] girl so you see how she thought about it [07:44] but once I knew that let her know to [07:47] come and get the toy so now I'm gonna [07:50] show you how she actually looks when I [07:52] use her normal word which is 3 good girl [07:55] then we go into play and when you're [07:58] playing tug with your dog smooth [07:59] movements don't do a bunch of jerky [08:02] movements make sure it's smooth and it's [08:04] easy for your dog to play with you you [08:06] don't want it to be an uncomfortable [08:08] game you want to get funky another thing [08:11] I do is because I wouldn't want to build [08:12] my dog's constant when they shake I'll [08:14] let them hold the toy away from me this [08:18] is showing her how big and strong and [08:20] tough she is [08:21] another thing you notice she's coming to [08:23] me to play the game the game is more fun [08:26] when she's engaging with me not when [08:29] she's by herself and that's what you [08:31] want you want your dog to come and play [08:33] with you so always make sure it's a lot [08:35] of fun so now I want her to release I'm [08:37] going to grab the handle so she doesn't [08:38] accidentally bite my hand and then I'm [08:40] gonna stop moving grab the new one him [08:44] and then she could get the new one and [08:46] then we go back in a plank good girl [08:48] very good and then I [08:50] want her out again so I'm gonna stop [08:51] moving bring out the new one and then [08:55] she could bite that one very good are [08:57] you a true good girl [09:07] all right so I know I can get her to [09:09] release it when I present the new toy so [09:12] now I'm going to add the dropping [09:14] command so same thing I stopped moving [09:17] and the new toy good girl [09:20] very good making sure we go with that [09:23] order we stopped moving out you don't do [09:35] that let's try that again and it's good [09:47] for you guys see that notice I did not [09:49] keep saying I just said it once you only [09:53] want to say once so we're ready to stop [09:56] out good very good [10:00] so now she's getting to the point where [10:03] she's releasing it a little bit better [10:05] then we can go to the technique that I [10:08] use with Charlie where we get on the out [10:10] and then you let me play with the same [10:11] toy okay so she's starting to get the [10:13] concept going back and forth using the [10:16] battery transfer with the other toy now [10:18] what I'm gonna do is I'm going to stop [10:20] the play with this toy I'm going to ask [10:22] her out once she releases terminal [10:24] marker and then i'ma let her reengage [10:26] with the same toy so it should look [10:28] something like this [10:29] good girl very nice very nice good girl [10:34] good job excuse me so we're ready to [10:45] stop so here we go oh nice job nice job [10:54] good so again we wanted to stop so many [10:57] stuff moving out good see how she's [11:02] released [11:02] and then I'll let her play again with [11:05] the same toy now we can extend the time [11:07] in between from when she releases to [11:10] when she gets the toy as well so we can [11:11] stop I'll slowly move away [11:15] if you move quick that's going to [11:18] trigger your dog to go after the toy so [11:21] move away slowly then breathe let the [11:24] dog play again good girl very nice so [11:27] we're trying again [11:28] I don't want to get too many times oh [11:33] very nice out and then we can do [11:39] something fun like Center I got in climb [11:45] Mari and that's going to be how we're [11:48] going to teach the first two techniques [11:49] to get our dog to drop the item that [11:52] they have the drop in command and now [11:54] I'm going to show you the third [11:54] technique where we use leash pressure to [11:57] get the dog to drop the item now let's [11:59] say option a and option B is not working [12:03] for some reason your dog doesn't want to [12:05] release the toy even if you offer them a [12:07] new toy or food so then you have to go [12:10] to option C option C we're gonna be [12:12] using leash pressure now leash pressure [12:14] is negative reinforcement before [12:17] attempting this make sure you do least [12:19] pressure training with your dog check [12:21] out this video to learn exactly how to [12:23] do that now let's say your dog does know [12:25] these pressure this is what we're gonna [12:27] be using to teach the dog to drop it [12:29] you have your dog you're playing with [12:31] your dog and the moment you want your [12:33] dog to release the item all you're going [12:35] to do is you're going to lightly lift up [12:37] on the leash so we're gonna continue the [12:39] pressure very light this should not be [12:41] choking your dog so remember this is a [12:43] cue so you apply the pressure the moment [12:46] the dawn releases the item you turn the [12:48] pressure off you use your terminal [12:50] marker and you allow your dog to pick up [12:53] the toy they just had okay this is going [12:56] to be a lot how we teach the out command [13:00] using leash pressure it's very simple a [13:03] puppy has a toy yeah a good puppy and [13:05] then we tell them out and we do slow [13:07] steady pressure until they release the [13:09] item get bud good boy so we're gonna [13:12] bring them back this way out and then [13:14] we're gonna lift up very light not [13:16] hard once he releases free job buddy [13:22] buddy wait hit my man oh boy got him [13:27] back very nice buddy very nice good boy [13:30] good boy oh and then lift good get it [13:33] buddy oh and then lift free good job a [13:45] good it's not something you want to do [13:48] for a long time or you don't want it too [13:50] many times in a row cuz I want him to [13:52] enjoy the toys I want him to have fun [13:54] and ideally we're gonna use the value [13:57] transfer where we take a toy of equal [13:59] value this is just something to fall [14:01] back on if for some reason you're unable [14:03] to get the dog to drop the item that [14:06] you're playing with currently and the [14:08] value transfer is simply not working [14:10] this works beautifully as you can see [14:12] and then we let them go back into play [14:14] remember a big part of working with our [14:16] dogs is building that trust we don't [14:19] want them to lose trust we don't want [14:20] them to think we're gonna take things [14:21] from them so we're just showing them all [14:23] they need to do is release it and we go [14:25] right back into playing the game let me [14:28] know what you guys think in the comments [14:29] below and

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 415/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we're going to be [00:01] teaching our dogs to stand for exam now [00:03] this is a competitive obedience routine [00:05] however if you're training a service dog [00:07] this could be one of the first steps [00:08] towards teaching your dog counterbalance [00:11] or counter support what we're going to [00:13] be doing is we're going to have our dog [00:14] in heel position we're gonna ask our dog [00:16] to stand we're gonna make sure the balls [00:18] of their feet or the balls of our feet [00:20] are aligned to the paws of their feet [00:22] then we would step away the evaluator [00:24] would come in pet the dog ask you to [00:27] return you would go back into position [00:29] exercise complete calling your dog into [00:31] heel now this is pretty simple however [00:34] it could be a little tricky a lot of [00:36] dogs want to break the position as you [00:37] walk around them or they'll break the [00:39] position when the evaluator comes over [00:41] to pet the dog so we want to make sure [00:44] that our dog understands that they need [00:46] to stand in that position so before [00:48] doing this make sure you have a good [00:50] stand stay and the way we were cast and [00:52] stay is the same way we work any state [00:55] just like in my video previously about [00:57] the stay command where I taught my dog [01:00] how to stay on a climb platform that [01:03] process is the same regardless of what [01:05] command you're having your dog staying [01:07] so for a sit stay if your dog breaks the [01:09] position you would say one no place your [01:11] dog back in the sit and you would [01:12] continue to do this until your dog [01:14] breaks position you say no and they sit [01:16] back on their own showing you that they [01:18] understand they need to stay in that [01:19] position and then of course maintaining [01:21] it for longer periods of time it's no [01:23] different with the stand stage you put [01:25] your dog in a stand if they break the [01:27] position you say one no and you place [01:29] them back in the stand and you continue [01:31] to do that until they understand that [01:32] they need to maintain that position so [01:35] in this video I'm going to show you [01:36] exactly how I teach the stand for exam [01:39] also make sure you guys stick around for [01:41] the end of the video where we're gonna [01:43] be going over a little bit of bonus [01:45] material all right I hope you guys enjoy [01:47] the video don't forget to hit that like [01:49] button and if you're feeling extra [01:51] generous hit that subscribe button thank [01:53] you so much alright so we want to take [01:56] our dog and we want to place them in the [01:57] stand command re skin good girl and then [02:01] what we're going to do is before we step [02:04] off we want to make sure that our dog's [02:06] paws are lined up [02:08] the balls of our feet and they're nice [02:09] and straight I like to step off with my [02:11] right foot it makes it easier for the [02:13] dog if they want our dog to follow will [02:15] step off with our left foot and then I [02:17] want to make sure my dog stays in the [02:18] stand stage if she breaks the command [02:20] I'm gonna say one note and I'm gonna go [02:22] back and I'm gonna readjust it so I like [02:24] to walk around get my dog comfortable [02:26] staying in the stand command or staying [02:29] in the stand position and before I have [02:32] other people come in and pet I'm gonna [02:34] come in pet my dog and walk away [02:37] so I'm acting as the evaluator I come in [02:42] really making sure that my dog has a [02:44] good stance day and I don't want the [02:46] paws to move it so if your dog's paw [02:49] start to move I would adjust that as [02:51] well so if she were to move her back [02:53] cause I would say no go in and reinforce [02:55] that so we want to make sure they're not [02:56] moving those paws at all and again I'm [02:59] just going to walk around and make sure [03:01] they maintain that position I'm gonna [03:03] come back swing around my gum into the [03:06] hill position and I'm gonna step out [03:08] again really get them used to standing [03:10] in that position so this is an exercise [03:13] that we're gonna want to work for that [03:14] stand for example and the reason why I [03:16] step away after I come back around into [03:19] heel position is I want my dog to know [03:21] that just because I come in this [03:22] position doesn't mean that the exercise [03:24] is over they have to maintain that [03:26] position so once we feel like we're good [03:29] and we're done with the exercise we can [03:32] go back into the position and we can [03:33] call them into heel and finish that [03:35] exercise but as I said it's good to have [03:37] other people come in and pet as well so [03:40] we'll do that right now so have a helper [03:48] do the exact same thing walk in do a [03:51] nice pet and then walk away [03:56] and she's doing really nice then I think [04:01] that's a good session for her back into [04:03] position [04:05] heel exercise finished well done good [04:10] job so that's going to be a great way to [04:12] train and work our stand for example [04:15] exercise [04:16] I hope you guys enjoyed today's video [04:18] make sure you leave a comment below it's [04:21] really cool for me to read the comments [04:23] that you guys have and I love answering

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 419/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] dog training is an art as well as a [00:02] science and if you can understand the [00:04] science then you can master the art [00:06] congratulations you're about to embark [00:08] on a great adventure with your dog the [00:10] following is a highly condensed brief [00:12] system to revolutionize life with your [00:15] canine companion [00:16] the purpose of dog training is to [00:18] enhance relationships between dogs and [00:20] their owners implementation of training [00:23] principles is designed to put you and [00:25] your dog on the same page together in [00:27] summary dog training is the process of [00:30] helping your dog to understand your [00:32] expectations as they are not capable of [00:35] cognitive reasoning as is practiced by [00:38] us bipedal mammals we must instead use [00:40] systems of conditioning pattern [00:43] recognition and positive habit forming [00:45] to create our desired results and help [00:48] the dog to comprehend our own thoughts [00:50] and feelings keep in mind that much of [00:52] the material will be repeated throughout [00:55] this audio book this is a good thing as [00:57] you will start to realize that dog [00:59] training is not as difficult as you may [01:01] have once thought it was before we begin [01:14] let's breakdown the dog training [01:16] terminology positive reinforcement this [01:19] is when you give your dog a reward for [01:21] performing a behavior that you would [01:23] like your dog to repeat negative [01:24] reinforcement this is when leash [01:26] pressure is applied and it has only [01:28] turned off when your dog complies [01:29] positive punishment this is when someone [01:32] would use a physical correction such as [01:34] popping on the leash to reduce the [01:36] occurrence of a behavior negative [01:38] punishment this is when you would hold a [01:40] reward from your dog for example your [01:42] dog wants a treat [01:43] so you tell him to sit he decides not to [01:46] sit so he doesn't receive the reward [01:48] leash pop this is when you would make a [01:50] snapping motion with the dog's leash to [01:52] engage the training collar to give the [01:54] dog a correction this would be a form of [01:57] positive punishment [01:58] Lorien this is when you use food to [02:00] guide your dog into a desired position [02:02] and once your dog is in that position [02:04] you would then release the reward to [02:06] your dog chasing this is when you make [02:08] your dog chase food that is in your hand [02:10] to increase food drive [02:12] and drive play drive and make the [02:14] training more fun for your dog you can [02:16] also have your dog cheese toys to build [02:19] your dog's toy drive value transfer this [02:21] is when your dog has something of value [02:23] and you use something of equal value to [02:26] get that item from your dog it's like [02:28] you're making a trade with your dog so [02:30] it's important to give your dog to the [02:31] other item when you use this technique [02:33] or your dog could use trust in you it's [02:36] also a great technique to teach the [02:38] command drop it [02:39] climb command this is a command that [02:41] requires your dog to go to an elevated [02:43] position and maintain that position [02:44] until released a climb command can be a [02:47] dog bed a park bench the car or whatever [02:50] position you choose for your dog as long [02:52] as it's an elevated position he'll is a [02:55] position either on your left or right [02:57] side that your dog must maintain when [02:59] commanded as soon as you stop moving [03:01] your dog should then sit in heel [03:03] position sit front this is when your dog [03:06] is sitting in front of you looking at [03:08] your face you why your dog as close to [03:10] you as possible without touching you the [03:13] dog should be centered and straight mark [03:15] or marker conditioned reinforcers this [03:18] is a word or sound that predicts either [03:20] a reward or correction your [03:22] communication channels to your dog [03:24] markers or conditioned reinforcers a [03:27] continuation marker this is a sound that [03:30] lets your dog know they are correct and [03:32] you will be delivering a reward to them [03:34] be terminal marker this lets your dog [03:37] know they are correct and they may come [03:39] to you to get the reward it is a release [03:42] word that also predicts that a reward is [03:44] about to be given see non reinforcement [03:48] marker this is for mistakes remember it [03:51] is imperative that your dog knows that [03:53] they can make a mistake and attempt the [03:55] behavior again this is a signal for [03:57] negative punishment which means [03:59] withholding the reward from your dog [04:01] until your dog does the behavior [04:02] correctly the condition correction this [04:06] is a signal for positive punishment [04:08] directional to the collar this means [04:10] that your dog understands what the [04:12] remote color is and understands that it [04:14] is a correction that is coming from you [04:15] and that it's not just some random bug [04:18] biting your dog's neck so when you [04:20] correct your dog with the remote collar [04:22] without a leash being attached he or she [04:24] knows [04:25] you are the one correcting him fig [04:27] shaping this is when you have a training [04:29] goal in mind but you're letting your dog [04:30] figure out what you want instead of [04:33] showing your dog for example you put [04:35] your dog in a room with the skateboard [04:36] when your dog naturally investigates the [04:39] skateboard you would use your [04:40] conditioned reinforcer to mark the dog's [04:42] behavior this will show the dog that the [04:44] skateboard is a good thing this is how [04:46] some trainers teach their dog to ride a [04:48] skateboard this is also a step that many [04:51] trainers used to teach their dog scent [04:53] detection free shaping this is when you [04:55] don't have a particular training goal in [04:57] mind and you are simply watching your [04:59] dog to see if your dog will perform a [05:01] behavior that you like for example your [05:03] dog does a cute stretch in the morning [05:04] when they wake up and you can mark this [05:06] action after enough repetitions your dog [05:08] will start to offer up that behavior for [05:10] a reward now let's go into a little more [05:12] detail of how these things work together [05:14] science of dog training teaching your [05:17] dog any command there is a proven [05:19] scientific process to teach your dog any [05:21] desired command so let's look now at [05:23] some of the basics that trainers use to [05:25] reinforce obedience behaviors using the [05:28] prior listed terminologies first we want [05:30] to develop our communication channels we [05:33] like to call these markers or [05:34] conditional reinforcers these are going [05:36] to be words or sounds that will let our [05:38] dog know when they are right or wrong [05:40] there are two positive types of markers [05:42] the first one is the continuation marker [05:45] this is a word or sound that lets the [05:47] dog know that they are correct and they [05:48] will be delivered a reward to apply a [05:50] continuation marker the dog must [05:52] maintain the position they are in for [05:54] example you tell your dog to sit once [05:57] your dog sits you use the continuation [05:59] marker to let your dog know they are [06:00] correct and you will be bringing them a [06:02] reward however they must maintain the [06:04] sit stay the next type is called [06:06] terminal markers these release dogs from [06:09] a previous behavior example if a dog was [06:12] in a sitting position they are released [06:13] from that position indicating the [06:15] sitting behavior is finished we have two [06:17] versions of this marker the first [06:19] version lets the dog know that they are [06:21] correct and they will come to the [06:22] trainer for the reward which also [06:24] releases them from the prior behavior [06:26] the second version of the terminal [06:28] marker lets the dog know that they are [06:29] correct and they may go to get the [06:31] reward for example if you have a ball [06:33] out in the training field and your dog [06:35] was aware that the ball was there they [06:37] would be released to get the [06:39] we also have a non reinforcement marker [06:41] and this is for mistakes for example if [06:44] you tell your dog to sit and the dog [06:46] downs instead you would use your non [06:49] reinforcement marker and then you would [06:51] recommand the sit once the dog sits you [06:54] would then reward the dog giving the dog [06:56] the ability to make mistakes and try [06:58] again is imperative if the dog gets the [07:01] correction for making a mistake then the [07:03] dog will become a little more careful [07:05] and less likely to attempt new behaviors [07:07] which would make it more difficult to [07:09] teach new commands the last marker is a [07:12] signal for positive punishment this [07:14] sound lets the dog know that they will [07:15] be corrected trainers use this for [07:17] behaviors they would like to remove from [07:19] the dog's repertoire then the correction [07:21] is performed through a remote training [07:23] color or leash pop with a pitch collar [07:25] it's important that these markers are [07:27] pinpointed at the moment of time the [07:29] undesirable behavior occurs because if [07:32] the timing is off the dog will think the [07:34] correction is being made for an entirely [07:36] different behavior once we teach our dog [07:38] the different markers we then move to [07:41] the next step which is to show the dog [07:42] what we want them to perform this is [07:45] called shaping before we name a command [07:47] the dog must first understand through a [07:50] physical cue what we want and expect [07:52] from them let's you sit as an example if [07:55] I'm using food I will lift my hand up [07:58] and as the dog follows my hand there but [08:01] naturally goes down into a sit the [08:03] second the dog sits I would use one of [08:06] my markers and then I would reward the [08:08] dog once I know that every time I lift [08:10] my hand up the dog will sit it is then [08:13] time to name the command this goes for [08:16] any command we are trying to teach our [08:17] dog we must first get the dog to perform [08:20] the behavior with a physical cue once we [08:23] have our dog performing the action with [08:25] our physical cue it has been time to [08:27] name the command a common mistake that [08:29] most people make is when they decide to [08:31] name the command they will say the [08:33] command while they are given the dog the [08:36] physical cue if you pair your physical [08:38] cue with your verbal command the [08:40] physical cue will override the verbal [08:42] command and that will become the only [08:44] cue for the behavior if we want the dog [08:47] to learn the verbal command then it is [08:49] important to make sure that the verbal [08:51] priest [08:52] it's the physical by a split-second it [08:54] must be predictable pattern to the dog [08:56] so the process becomes command motivate [09:00] mark and reward in that order therefore [09:03] you say sit then you lift your hand once [09:06] your dog's butt hits the ground you then [09:08] mark and then reward you will continue [09:10] to use the physical cue until the dog [09:12] beats you to it meaning you say sit and [09:16] before you lift your hand the dog is [09:18] already sitting if you follow this order [09:20] you can teach your dog any desired [09:22] command that the dog can physically [09:24] perform here's a simple analogy to [09:26] remember how timing works we need to [09:28] make sure that we always keep timing in [09:30] mind when we are training and we need to [09:33] never pair our physical with our verbal [09:35] if we are trying to teach our dog a [09:37] verbal command or a verbal cue this [09:39] analogy will help you remember the [09:41] process let's say I place a blindfold on [09:43] you and I told you that I was going to [09:45] swing a stick at your head but before I [09:48] swing the stick I'll say duck this would [09:50] give you just enough time to duck before [09:53] I hit you with the stick but imagine if [09:55] I said duck and swung the stick at the [09:57] exact same time you would get beaten in [10:00] the head with the stick every single [10:02] time because it wasn't predictable so [10:04] when you are teaching your dog a command [10:06] say the command first and then show your [10:09] dog the physical cue just like in this [10:12] analogy putting everything together [10:13] teaching a new service dog let's say we [10:16] want to teach a service dog to perform [10:18] deep pressure therapy where the dog lays [10:20] firmly on the owner like laying on their [10:22] lap in response to a specific event in [10:25] this case the owners leg begins shaking [10:27] in this event you want the dog's [10:29] behavior to be triggered by a natural [10:32] physical cue which is the leg shaking we [10:35] also want the dog to be able to do this [10:36] in response to a verbal command let's [10:39] use the word lap first ensure your dog [10:41] can perform the task by using markers [10:43] and a physical cue such as luring or [10:46] leash pressure for example the pressure [10:48] from the leash provides a motivation for [10:50] the dog to come and sit on your lap or [10:52] luring the dog to your lap using food [10:54] mark and reward successful completion [10:56] once the dog demonstrates successfully [10:59] perform the task via the physical cue [11:01] then associate the task with another [11:03] physical cue in this [11:05] it's the leg shaking the process would [11:07] go as follows [11:08] begin to shake your leg then immediately [11:10] follow but do not pair the action with [11:14] luring or the leash pressure to bring [11:15] the dog to the lab mark and reward the [11:18] successful completion of this behavior [11:19] next begin to implement a verbal command [11:22] into the mix this is important because [11:24] somebody who has a service dog may not [11:27] only want their dog to implement [11:28] something like deep pressure therapy [11:30] only when they shake their leg they may [11:32] want to be able to ask their dog to [11:34] perform this behavior at any point in [11:36] time so teaching the dog a verbal [11:38] command for this is also very important [11:40] for this start to shake your leg then [11:43] announce the verbal command let mark and [11:46] reward when the behavior is completed do [11:48] not say the verbal command before you [11:50] shake your leg you must shake your leg [11:53] first then deliver the verbal command [11:55] mark and reward upon completion the idea [11:58] is that it becomes a predictable pattern [12:00] for the dog they realize that leg [12:02] shaking always predicts the behavior [12:04] eventually when you shake your leg the [12:06] dog will perform the desired behavior [12:08] immediately this process will work for [12:11] all the desired tasks these are the [12:13] important introductory concepts to [12:15] understand before we move into the [12:17] execution of the basic dog training [12:19] concepts in the next chapter dog [12:21] training basics and the first part of [12:23] this booklet we'll go over the [12:24] fundamentals that I always teach to new [12:26] students this is perhaps the most [12:29] important part and every other part of [12:31] your dogs training skills are built upon [12:33] this foundation remember to follow the [12:35] three primary principles of dog training [12:38] one timing it's scientifically proven [12:41] that we have approximately one second [12:44] to influence a dog's behavior this means [12:47] you have one second to reward your dog [12:48] for a behavior you would like them to [12:50] repeat and one second to correct your [12:53] dog for any behavior you would not like [12:54] them to repeat if the reward or the [12:57] correction does not come within one [12:59] second then your dog will not make the [13:01] connection the moment your dog does a [13:04] behavior you are trying to capture you [13:06] have to either deliver a primary [13:08] reinforcer such as food toy or affection [13:11] or a conditioned reinforcer such as our [13:14] markers the terminal marker or the [13:16] continuation marker [13:17] within the first second of the dog [13:19] completing that behavior the same [13:22] principle applies for actions you would [13:24] not like your dog to repeat the moment [13:26] your dog does the behavior in question [13:28] you have to deliver either the primary [13:30] correction or condition correction [13:33] within a second of your dog doing that [13:35] behavior here is an example of how [13:38] important timing is let's say you're [13:40] doing a down stay with your dog and [13:42] you're in a wide-open space like a [13:44] football field while you're walking away [13:46] from your dog across the field your dog [13:48] breaks the down state without you seeing [13:51] your dog then decides to run to you and [13:53] when you turn around and see your dog [13:55] running at you you then correct your dog [13:58] for breaking the down state even though [14:00] you believe that you are correcting your [14:02] dog for breaking a down stay what you [14:04] really did was corrected your dog for [14:06] coming to you which is something we [14:08] don't want to do since you are not able [14:11] to see your dog break the down stay you [14:14] should not have corrected the dog [14:15] instead you should have rewarded your [14:18] dog for coming to you to motivation your [14:21] dog will always do whatever is most [14:23] motivating for example if you're trying [14:26] to get your dog to perform Asit and he [14:28] is surrounded by his favorite thing in [14:30] the world which is rabbits he's going to [14:32] be more motivated to chase the rabbits [14:35] in comparison to his motivation to work [14:37] for the tree it's important to keep in [14:40] mind that a dog can be motivated by many [14:42] things they can be motivated to access [14:44] something pleasant such as an actual [14:47] reward or the act of doing something fun [14:50] or they can be motivated to prevent [14:52] something unpleasant by making sure that [14:55] you always provide the most motivating [14:57] factors for your dog you will ensure [14:59] reliability in your dog's obedience [15:01] there are four ways you can motivate a [15:04] dog to perform behavior you have food [15:06] toy affection and force it's important [15:10] you learn to use all four types of [15:12] motivation for your training another [15:14] factor to keep in mind is that speed is [15:16] based on motivation the more motivated [15:19] your dog is the faster your dog will [15:21] perform the desired behavior lastly when [15:24] a dog doesn't behavior it's because of [15:26] three main reasons firstly the dog is [15:29] trying to get access to a reward [15:31] - the dog is trying to prevent something [15:34] unpleasant or three the dog is doing the [15:37] behavior because the behavior itself is [15:40] self reinforcing or self rewarding [15:42] meaning the behavior is actually fun [15:45] like chasing rabbits the dog may never [15:48] catch the rabbit but the act of chasing [15:50] the rabbit feels so good to the dog that [15:52] it continues to do that behavior three [15:55] consistency this one is paramount [15:57] because even if you have bad timing and [16:00] poor motivation if you are consistent [16:02] your dog will still be able to learn you [16:05] always want to keep in mind to always [16:07] stay consistent with what you want and [16:09] what you expect from your dog if you let [16:12] your dog jump on the furniture one day [16:14] don't correct your dog for jumping on [16:16] the furniture the next day if you are [16:18] inconsistent you will create stress and [16:20] confusion for your dog if you would like [16:23] your dog to be on the couch sometimes [16:24] but not all the time then make it a [16:27] command so the dog can only perform the [16:30] behavior when you command it you also [16:32] want to be consistent with the way you [16:34] say your markers as well as your [16:35] commands remember your dog doesn't see [16:38] the word sit spelled out as si T in [16:41] their mind they hear a sound so you want [16:44] your command always to sound the same [16:46] meaning [16:47] you shouldn't constantly be changing the [16:50] rise and inflection of your voice on [16:51] this topic let's now discuss [16:54] predictability this word is not part of [16:57] the primary principles but it's one you [16:59] always need to keep in mind when it [17:01] comes to dog training always think about [17:03] your actions as you train your dog and [17:05] if they're becoming predictable or not [17:07] you can use this to improve the training [17:09] process or by contrast it can eventually [17:12] create problems for example let's say [17:15] you love taking your dog to the beach [17:17] and this is an activity that your dog [17:19] enjoys every time you're ready to leave [17:21] you call your dog to you eventually your [17:24] dog will learn not to come to you when [17:27] you call them at the beach because it's [17:29] now predictable pattern that when you [17:31] call your dog that it's time to leave so [17:34] this would make it tough to get your dog [17:35] to come to you because the dog doesn't [17:37] want to leave the beach instead you [17:41] would always want to play come when [17:42] called games at the beach that pretty [17:44] a release and a reward like a ball this [17:47] way your dog will enjoy coming to you [17:49] when called it's a simple concept if [17:52] your dog can predict something then your [17:54] dog can learn it just like obedience you [17:57] say the command and then you show your [17:58] dog the physical cue this way the dog [18:01] learns that when you say command it is [18:03] then followed by the action that gets [18:04] the dog into the position once the dog [18:07] knows this you no longer need the [18:09] physical cue because it is now [18:10] predictable for your dog my get out of [18:14] jail free card for all the dogs that I [18:16] work with I have what I call a get out [18:19] of jail free card which is a reward for [18:21] successfully coming to me even if my dog [18:24] did something that I disapprove of if my [18:26] dog comes to me I will reward my dog for [18:29] that action the action of coming to me [18:31] you always want your dog to know that [18:34] coming to you is a good thing no matter [18:37] what happened before that this is for [18:39] safety if your dog doesn't know what to [18:41] do in a situation that may be confusing [18:43] if they come to you as the default [18:45] behavior this could be life-saving [18:47] so it's very important to keep that in [18:49] mind and I always recommend to everybody [18:52] to use that get-out-of-jail-free card [18:54] with their dogs understanding operant [18:57] conditioning operant conditioning is a [18:59] form of learning that teaches the [19:00] subject desired behaviors through [19:02] consequences and rewards this is the [19:05] psychological foundation that dog [19:07] trainers used as the underlining [19:09] framework for all techniques remember [19:11] from the last chapter how there are four [19:13] important quadrants to opera [19:15] conditioning and those four are positive [19:17] reinforcement negative reinforcement [19:19] positive punishment and negative [19:21] punishment using operant conditioning [19:24] style training with your dog will teach [19:26] him or her that third behavior has an [19:29] effect on their environment meaning the [19:31] dog believes that it is their action [19:33] that can make rewards or corrections [19:36] happen to them before we move forward I [19:38] would like to explain how to remember [19:40] the four quadrants that we learned [19:42] earlier and go further into what they [19:44] mean the first thing to keep in mind is [19:47] that the term positive means to add to [19:49] the equation or to add to the situation [19:52] so positive reinforcement means we are [19:54] adding a physical reward [19:56] like a tree a toy or peti on the [19:59] contrast negative means we are taking [20:01] away so negative punishment means you [20:04] are removing the reward such as not [20:07] giving the dog a treat until the dog [20:08] does the behavior correctly positive [20:11] punishment means to add a physical [20:13] correction negative reinforcement means [20:16] to turn off pressure once the desired [20:19] result or behavior is reached so [20:22] positive means adding to the equation [20:24] negative means removing from the [20:27] equation punishment means preventing the [20:30] behavior through being repeated and [20:32] reinforcement means encouraging a [20:34] behavior to be repeated we will start [20:37] with the easiest of the four to [20:38] understand and that's positive [20:40] reinforcement this is what most people [20:42] use with their dogs [20:44] the owner will give the dog some form of [20:46] a physical reward when the dog performs [20:48] the desired behavior so for example in [20:51] the dog 6 the owner will give the dog a [20:53] treat for city teaching the dog that [20:55] sitting is a good thing an easy way to [20:58] look at it is that we use positive [20:59] reinforcement for any behavior we would [21:02] like the dog to repeat by giving them a [21:04] reward for that action the next one that [21:07] most people use and understand is [21:09] negative punishment as I mentioned [21:11] before all negative punishment means in [21:13] dog training is to withhold a reward [21:15] that should be delivered when the dog [21:17] makes a mistake or isn't performing the [21:19] correct behavior and as a result the [21:22] human will not give the dog to treat [21:24] until the dog shows the desired behavior [21:26] for example you're teaching your dog is [21:29] sit and the dog keeps trying to jump up [21:31] to get the treat out of your hand so you [21:33] withhold the reward from the dog the [21:35] second the dog sits you immediately pay [21:38] the dog and the dog then realizes that [21:40] all he had to do for the treat was to [21:43] sit the next is positive punishment [21:46] which is a process of giving the dog a [21:48] physical correction with the training [21:50] collar to stop undesirable behavioral [21:52] traits if I have a dog and that dog's [21:55] favorite thing in the world is to chase [21:57] cars the only way I can stop that dog [22:00] from performing that behavior is by [22:02] correcting it out of the dog's [22:04] repertoire remember everything is based [22:07] on motivation whatever the dog is most [22:10] motivated to do that's what the dog will [22:12] do so do not chase the car the dog must [22:15] be more motivated not to receive a [22:18] correction then the dog is motivated to [22:21] chase the vehicle last is negative [22:24] reinforcement we use this in dog [22:26] training by implementing a technique [22:27] called leash pressure work every dog has [22:30] what's called classical opposition [22:32] reflex meaning when you pull one [22:34] direction on the leash the dog pulls the [22:37] opposite in this exercise we teach the [22:39] dog to go with the pressure on the leash [22:41] by using negative reinforcement so by [22:45] not turning off the pressure until the [22:47] dog complies teaches a dog always to go [22:49] with the pressure on the leash and we [22:51] can then use this to teach behaviors and [22:54] develop reliability within our obedience [22:57] by understanding and utilizing Opera [22:59] conditioning with your dog you can train [23:02] your dog to become that well-behaved [23:04] companion you've always wanted different [23:06] types of training tools please note that [23:09] I do not advocate the use of any [23:12] training collar whether it be remote [23:13] training collar pinch collar and choke [23:15] chain or any other questionable collars [23:18] however it's important to understand how [23:20] they work so that you can be fully [23:22] prepared in the event that you feel you [23:24] need to use one remote training collar [23:27] these are also known as shock collars [23:30] when these collars are used correctly [23:31] they are perfectly safe however ethical [23:35] considerations arise when used by [23:37] inexperienced negligent or careless [23:40] trainers pinch collar the style of [23:43] collar adds correction to the dog by [23:46] creating pinching or pressure when the [23:48] leash is popped activating the collar [23:50] increasing motivation to perform [23:52] obedience tests martingale collar this [23:55] is similar to the pinch collar as far as [23:57] the use and application however this [24:00] collar only works well on dogs with low [24:02] correction levels meaning if the dog is [24:05] very sensitive to a correction this cow [24:08] it usually doesn't provide enough of a [24:10] correction for dogs with higher [24:12] correction levels who are less sensitive [24:14] to corrections gentle leader or halting [24:16] this was originally designed for a horse [24:18] and the mindset was if it works for a [24:21] 1500 pound horse why would it work [24:24] dog the problem is horses are built [24:27] differently than dogs and it can be [24:28] unsafe to use on your dog because over [24:31] time it has the potential to increase [24:33] the cause of neck injuries choke chain [24:36] this collar has the potential to be [24:38] dangerous and can cause lifelong [24:39] injuries to your dog only the most [24:41] skilled dog trainers can use this collar [24:43] correctly without it being a risk to [24:46] their dog's help so unless you're an [24:47] expert I would advise to stay away from [24:49] this collar flatten eylon or leather [24:52] collar these colors are basic functional [24:54] collars they can hold your dog's dog [24:56] tags and provide some pressure when used [24:58] with the leash harness these are [25:00] excellent and highly recommended for [25:03] when you want your dog to pull I use a [25:05] harness to build a dog's confidence I [25:07] also use it when I'm exercising them [25:09] there are multiple different types of [25:11] harnesses that can be used on a dog some [25:13] are designed to pull and others can be [25:15] used for working dogs puppy binder after [25:17] buying your puppy it's a very good idea [25:20] to not only ensure your dog is properly [25:22] vaccinated but that you also have copies [25:25] available of all important information [25:27] and medical records [25:29] I feel the simplest solution is to keep [25:31] a binder available with all the [25:33] important documents such as veterinarian [25:36] records the puppy's birth certificate [25:38] any contracts related to the purchase or [25:41] any other records that your puppy may [25:43] have for different types of training one [25:46] reward-based training this is the ideal [25:49] training to start your dog on but it can [25:51] also take the longest this is when you [25:53] use rewards to shape all the desired [25:55] behaviors and you use negative [25:57] punishment when your dog fails to [25:59] perform the action they learn to go into [26:01] different positions to access rewards [26:03] this training is almost entirely [26:05] stress-free for a dog and it also makes [26:08] the training very positive for them this [26:10] training uses a combination of positive [26:12] reinforcement and negative punishment [26:14] pressure based training the style of [26:16] training is excellent if you want faster [26:19] results this training uses a combination [26:21] of negative reinforcement negative [26:23] punishment and positive reinforcement [26:25] you turn the pressure on when your dog [26:28] complies you immediately turn the [26:30] pressure off and reward your dog I don't [26:32] always prefer to start this way but I [26:34] like to use this a little later in the [26:36] training for reliability [26:38] and for teaching the dog how to turn off [26:39] pressure however some people do prefer [26:42] to start this way because by beginning [26:45] with the style your dog will learn more [26:47] quickly to go into the desired positions [26:49] in order to turn off that pressure [26:50] escape avoidance training this is when [26:53] you correct your dog into the desired [26:54] position this is considered an older [26:57] style of training and is not as commonly [26:59] used anymore the dog does learn very [27:02] fast but it can create a bad association [27:05] to the training the dog is learning to [27:07] escape a correction by going into the [27:10] desired position [27:11] this training uses a combination of [27:13] positive punishment positive [27:15] reinforcement and negative punishment [27:17] for balanced training this is the most [27:20] preferred style of training this is when [27:22] you use a combination of all three [27:24] methods the balanced training also uses [27:27] all four elements positive reinforcement [27:29] negative reinforcement positive [27:31] punishment and negative punishment in my [27:34] professional experience this salad [27:36] training creates the happiest dog with [27:39] the highest level of reliability if [27:41] you're going to correct your dog when [27:44] should you correct your dog next we're [27:47] gonna go over different examples of when [27:49] you would need to correct your dog [27:50] other than breaking a state it's also [27:52] imperative to understand that you should [27:54] not be correcting your dog until your [27:57] dog knows two commands knows what's [27:59] expected of him knows how to turn on [28:01] pressure by complying and has been given [28:03] a clear path to success here's an [28:06] important analogy to understand how [28:08] Corrections work when training your dog [28:10] it's important to remember that every [28:12] dog has would be like to call out their [28:14] own bank account this would be the [28:16] correction level some dogs are very [28:19] wealthy and some are painless just like [28:21] people let's say you are speeding down [28:23] the highway and the police officer pulls [28:25] you over and writes you a 25 cent [28:27] speeding ticket the second the officer [28:29] leaves you may start speeding again the [28:32] ticket wasn't high enough to get you to [28:34] change your behavior but let's say he [28:36] pulls you over and writes you a ten [28:38] million dollar speeding ticket now it's [28:40] so high that you avoid driving all [28:43] together and you become very stressed [28:45] out but let's say he pulls you over and [28:47] writes you a hundred and twenty-five [28:49] dollar speeding ticket that would be [28:51] enough [28:52] to get you to slow down without getting [28:53] you to avoid the behavior of driving [28:55] this is what we must do with our dogs we [28:58] need to correct down at a level that is [29:00] adequate to their bank account if you [29:02] give your dog of command and they choose [29:04] not to perform that command the moment [29:07] they decide they aren't going to execute [29:08] the command you would say one note and [29:11] then you would correct your dog with the [29:13] training collar after the correction you [29:15] will get the command to your dog once [29:16] again if your dog still doesn't perform [29:19] the behavior you would then use your [29:21] leash pressure to help the dog go into [29:24] that position so it should go as [29:26] followed you ask the dog to do the [29:28] behavior they don't do it you give them [29:30] a correction you recommend the behavior [29:32] if they don't do it you simply help them [29:34] perform the behavior using a physical [29:36] cue that you use to teach your dog to [29:39] perform that specific behavior you can [29:41] use Corrections immediately to stop [29:43] undesirable behaviors that are not [29:45] related to obedience commands such as [29:47] sit down command heel and so forth for [29:49] example if your dog digs then you can [29:51] correct that behavior out of your dog's [29:53] repertoire but you have to be sure to [29:56] correct your dog when they are digging [29:57] not hours after the hole has been dug [30:00] remember it's important that we set our [30:02] dogs up for success through staging [30:04] different scenarios so we can reward [30:06] them the second they do it right we also [30:08] set them up for failure so we can [30:11] correct them the moment they do [30:12] something wrong once you correct a dog [30:14] for any bad behavior you must [30:16] immediately reward them when they are no [30:18] longer doing that bad behavior so if [30:20] your dog was digging and you corrected [30:22] your dog the second your dog stops [30:24] digging you would praise and reward them [30:26] for making the right choice we must make [30:28] sure we always give our dog's the right [30:31] answer here's another example let's say [30:33] your dog jumps on people as many dogs do [30:35] you would say no the moment your dog [30:38] jumped up and you would then give them [30:40] the correction the second all four paws [30:43] are back on the ground you would [30:44] immediately praise and reward your dog [30:46] this way your dog will learn that if he [30:48] wants to be petted then he must be [30:50] sitting nicely you can also use this [30:52] technique with leash pressure instead of [30:54] the correction here's a simple list of [30:56] behaviors that can be removed using this [30:58] concept however it is important to keep [31:01] in mind that there are different [31:02] techniques to stop and teach different [31:04] behaviors [31:04] so you don't necessarily have to correct [31:07] behaviors out of a dog's repertoire [31:09] depending on how intense or how much the [31:12] dog likes to perform these behaviors the [31:14] situation will change depending on each [31:17] dog play biting biting leash jumping on [31:20] furniture jumping on doors barking at [31:22] people outside such as the mail carrier [31:25] barking at the doorbell working in the [31:27] crate barking for attention relieving [31:29] themselves inside the house shooing [31:31] furniture eating feces chasing such as [31:34] chasing the house cat marking their [31:36] territory barking at dogs or people [31:38] while on a walk [31:39] getting into the trash so we went over [31:42] when to correct your dog but when not to [31:45] correct our dogs if your dog is afraid [31:47] of something do not use a physical [31:50] correction to help them get over this [31:52] fear as this will only make the fear [31:54] worse for example let's say your dog is [31:57] afraid of fireworks and you have your [31:59] dog in a down state and somebody starts [32:01] shooting off fireworks if your dog [32:03] breaks the down stay to get away from [32:05] the fireworks you would not want to [32:07] correct them back into the down stick [32:09] instead you would let the dog break the [32:12] down state without any consequences [32:14] because in the dog's mind he's not [32:17] breaking the down but escaping the [32:19] fireworks [32:19] you should not correct your dog for [32:21] showing signs of food aggression or toy [32:23] aggression correcting a dog for food or [32:26] toy aggression can on occasions make the [32:30] aggression much worse if your dog is [32:32] being aggressive in this instance it's [32:35] usually because your dog doesn't trust [32:36] you and believes you'll take the food [32:38] away or the toy away and will not give [32:41] it back if you're running into this then [32:43] I would first suggest doing a value [32:45] transfer when using the value transfer [32:47] technique you have to make sure your dog [32:50] is not being aggressive when you show [32:52] them the other item this is vital to [32:54] keep in mind because if you offer the [32:56] other reward when the dog is being [32:59] aggressive then you would be reinforcing [33:01] the aggression which you obviously don't [33:04] want a potentially more practical [33:06] solution for food aggression is to feed [33:08] your dog in their crate the basic [33:11] strategy is to never take food away from [33:13] your dog after it has been given and [33:15] crate feeding solves the [33:17] problem this way they will never have a [33:19] fear of you stealing their food another [33:22] option is to start feeding every meal [33:24] from your hand and making your dog work [33:26] for it [33:26] if the aggression issue seems to be [33:29] getting worse then I would suggest [33:31] scheduling a private lesson with a local [33:33] professional confidence building [33:35] confidence in a dog is a lot like [33:37] confidence in a human almost universally [33:40] it's a positive characteristic as an [33:43] example would you want a confident [33:45] employee or one who's unsure a confident [33:48] doctor or a frightened doctor do you [33:50] want a social circle with friends who [33:52] are confident and positive or who are [33:54] constantly having anxiety as a trainer [33:57] sometimes owners tell me of their issues [33:58] with dogs that lack confidence an [34:00] example might be a dog who's shaky [34:03] scared to try new things [34:05] fearful of ordinary situation or prefers [34:08] to ignore her owner instead of doing [34:10] something uncomfortable the solution [34:12] they may say is I want my dog to become [34:14] submissive to me so it stops acting [34:16] anxious and does what I tell it however [34:19] contrary to popular belief we do not [34:22] want a submissive dog in a dog's mind [34:24] submission means look how small I am [34:27] please don't hurt me so why would we [34:30] ever want our dogs to feel that way the [34:32] dog may push itself to do certain [34:34] behaviors and it's truly become [34:36] submissive but these behaviors end up [34:38] being out of fear at the end of the day [34:40] you have a fearful dog not a confident [34:43] one by contrast a panic dog is much [34:46] easier to teach new behaviors to a dog [34:49] that is willing to try new things is [34:51] much easier to train than a dog with [34:54] fearful characteristics this means far [34:56] fewer problems with your dog down the [34:58] road compared to having a submissive [35:00] fearful pup there are a few things that [35:02] can be done with a puppy or adult to [35:04] increase their confidence immediately [35:06] similar to the Disney character of the [35:08] Superdog we can build the dogs [35:10] confidence by making them believe they [35:13] are a super dog this can be done through [35:15] confidence-building activities an easy [35:17] way to look at confidence-building is to [35:19] take something that the dog may be [35:21] unsure about and make it predictable as [35:23] something pleasant [35:25] instead for example let's say you want [35:27] your dog to get comfortable with [35:28] different noises and sound so you [35:30] filming [35:31] kiddie pool with empty plastic bottles [35:33] for the puppy or dog to plan at first [35:36] the puppy or dog may be hesitant about [35:38] the situation but if you show the puppy [35:41] or dog that it's fun by either getting [35:43] in the pool first or luring the puppy or [35:45] the dog into the pool [35:47] they will soon discover that it's a fun [35:49] activity and the puppy or the dog will [35:51] associate the sound of the plastic [35:53] bottles with fun this is something that [35:55] a lot of protection dog trainers will do [35:58] with their puppies because in many [35:59] protection sports they will use what's [36:02] called a bottle curtain it's basically a [36:04] bunch of empty plastic bottles hanging [36:06] from a pole in a curtain like fashion [36:08] that the dog will have to run through [36:10] simply put it's about constantly [36:13] exposing your dogs to new things and [36:15] making those activities pleasant by [36:18] predicting something that the dog enjoys [36:20] if you understand this I don't have to [36:23] show you different confidence-building [36:25] scenarios you can come up with scenarios [36:28] on your own by being creative and [36:31] understanding how the science works take [36:34] something make it predict something nice [36:36] eventually whatever predict something [36:38] nice will become something your dog is [36:40] confident and comfortable with the idea [36:43] is to be on the same team as your dog [36:45] rather than having a relationship based [36:47] on fear or the belief that the owner [36:49] needs to be the Alpha behavioral issues [36:52] you can almost always expect to run into [36:55] some kind of behavioral problem with any [36:57] dog of any age and the key is knowing [37:00] how to properly handle the situation [37:02] when it arises below is a list of some [37:05] of the most common behavioral problems [37:07] that we run into in regard to both [37:09] puppies and adult dogs including [37:11] aggression related problems while these [37:14] behaviors can occur with any dog the [37:16] solutions are different depending on the [37:19] dog's age which we'll explore in a more [37:21] detail a list of common behavioral [37:23] issues jumping up on people point on the [37:26] leash barking at the front door [37:27] relieving themselves in the house [37:29] barking or whining in their crate [37:31] barking at dogs or people while on a [37:34] walk [37:34] chewing furniture destroying property [37:36] begging for food getting on counters or [37:39] furniture digging eating feces chasing [37:43] biting at your hand when trying to take [37:45] a toy biting or growling when taking [37:47] away food biting at your hand when [37:49] putting on a collar or leash [37:51] aggressively rushing at house guests who [37:53] enter acting aggressive inside the creep [37:55] growling barking or snapping if given a [37:58] command aggression towards other dogs [38:00] among behavioral issues the most [38:03] concerning is often aggression this can [38:05] be a big concern among many pet owners [38:07] because it calls into question whether [38:09] your dog can normally interact with [38:12] other people and other dogs a family may [38:14] also be upset because they no longer [38:16] feel as safe they may also believe that [38:18] the aggressive behaviors are a sign of [38:20] bad breeding or a dog with psychological [38:22] issues however aggressive tendencies are [38:25] often misunderstood and many may not be [38:28] related to your dog's breed nor because [38:30] of psychological problems very often [38:32] owners have unknowingly conditioned [38:35] their dog into certain behaviors and [38:37] it's especially important for owners and [38:39] new puppies to be mindful of these [38:41] principles in the next chapter we'll go [38:44] over how to deal with behavioral [38:45] problems aggression in dogs of different [38:48] ages what can cause it as well as many [38:50] other issues with raising a new dog [38:52] choosing and raising a dog puppies [38:55] whether you're a first-time or [38:57] experienced dog owner getting a new [38:59] puppy can be a lot to consider [39:01] of course owners who prepare will [39:03] experience a lot less stress and a lot [39:06] more fun and this part will go over some [39:09] important pointers regarding bringing a [39:11] new puppy into the home and how to raise [39:13] them choosing the right breed one of the [39:16] most common questions people ask me is [39:18] hey what breed should I get and my first [39:21] thought is typically what's your [39:23] lifestyle like I want to know if you [39:25] lead an active lifestyle do you want a [39:28] companion to take hikes would or would [39:30] you prefer the type of dog who enjoys [39:32] lounging by the fireplace and all day [39:35] movie marathons this is a major factor [39:37] because dog breeds equal incredibly [39:40] different personalities the common [39:41] belief that it's not the dog it's how [39:44] you raise them is a huge misconception [39:46] while nurture does have an effect [39:49] genetics can play an even larger role [39:52] some of these bullet points may seem [39:54] like common sense but many people need [39:57] minding about these factors it's not all [39:59] about how cute your new puppy is if you [40:02] lead an active lifestyle get a dog that [40:04] can keep up with you for example you may [40:07] want a villa that's just one example of [40:10] many breeds that are excellent for an [40:12] active lifestyle by the contrast if you [40:14] lead a lifestyle that is less active [40:16] perhaps if you work at home or on the [40:19] computer all day a Vizsla may not be [40:21] such a good idea instead maybe a Boston [40:24] Terrier would be a better idea it would [40:26] have just enough energy but it wouldn't [40:29] go into overdrive by never having an off [40:31] switch after determining the activity [40:34] level the next thing to consider is [40:35] factors like the size of the dog [40:37] whether you're worried about shedding if [40:39] you can maintain a thick coat or if you [40:41] prefer a thin coat or a dog with hair [40:44] instead of fur another factor is [40:46] intelligence without directly insulting [40:49] any of our canine friends the [40:51] unfortunate truth is that some dogs are [40:53] smarter than others now getting the most [40:56] intelligent dog could seem like the best [40:58] idea but if you don't keep that advanced [41:00] brain constantly working such a dog [41:03] could become destructive on the other [41:05] hand a smart dog could also be a great [41:08] joy to home these are again factors that [41:11] depend on the personal preference and [41:13] lifestyle another common concern is the [41:16] cost of a new dog veterinarian bills can [41:19] be steep and some dogs are prone to many [41:21] health problems by comparison to other [41:23] breeds that tend to stay healthier as [41:25] you can see it's important to take many [41:28] variables into consideration equipment [41:31] to make life easier it's best to be [41:33] prepared and to have the right equipment [41:35] when the puppy arrives here's a list of [41:37] some of the basics that I like to have [41:39] whenever I get a new puppy first the [41:41] creep your puppy will need to be potty [41:44] trained therefore it's important to [41:46] initially have a crate that is only a [41:48] little larger than the puppy with only [41:50] enough space to stand up turn around and [41:53] lay down this will make the puppy learn [41:55] to hold it or hold their bladder after [41:58] your puppy grows up and is already potty [42:00] trained a bigger crate is acceptable [42:02] puppy pen this is a good idea if you [42:05] want your puppy to run around and play [42:07] but limiting access [42:09] to the rest of the house you can also [42:11] use puppy gates for this puppy gates can [42:15] usually fit in any doorway within the [42:17] household the leash I recommend a 4 or 6 [42:21] foot thin leash don't worry about [42:23] getting the collar until you get your [42:25] puppy because you don't know yet the [42:26] size of the dog you're going to get and [42:28] it will need to be fitted food and water [42:31] bowl I like to reinforce the importance [42:34] of a proper diet many of the common [42:36] brands of dog food we see at the [42:38] supermarket are not a good idea for your [42:40] dog and could cause serious health [42:42] issues in the future when choosing the [42:45] right food for overall health [42:46] freeze-dried and raw can give the best [42:49] results it would be wise though to speak [42:51] to a representative at a local natural [42:54] pet store dog bed help your puppy to [42:58] learn to adjust to their own special [43:00] place of comfort a popular command we [43:02] use is the climb command that teaches [43:05] the dog to go to their bed and stay [43:07] until given the release word this is [43:09] very easy to teach when you know the [43:11]

rooms they can be installed in [44:12] most doorways start to develop puppy [44:15] proof habits much like being concerned [44:18] with a rogue two-year-old child it's [44:20] wise to pay [44:21] - what is accessible for the puppy to [44:23] chew on or to steal don't leave your [44:26] remote control in the coffee table for [44:27] instance is your bedroom compatible for [44:30] your puppy's crate it's a good idea to [44:32] keep your puppy close to you at night to [44:34] prevent stress and anxiety which could [44:37] lead to a lot of whimpering during the [44:38] puppy's early years you should also be [44:41] prepared to get up during the night to [44:43] potty the puppy preparing yourself for [44:45] the dogs training the moment your dog [44:48] enters your home it is learning we want [44:51] to make sure it's learning the things [44:52] that we'll maintain as it grows into an [44:55] adult below is a list of some basic [44:57] obedience commands that will help you [44:59] have an easier more pleasant life with [45:00] your dog you can begin to apply these [45:02] right away using the information you've [45:04] learned so far in this book and in the [45:07] next chapter we'll go into more detail [45:08] in the methodology basic commands are as [45:11] follows [45:12] sit sit stay come when called down down [45:15] stayed climb command or go to your bed [45:17] stick and loose leash walking raising a [45:21] puppy let's first go over the basics of [45:23] puppy raising as many owners choose to [45:25] bring home a new dog when they're still [45:26] very young the mindset of a puppy is [45:29] different from that of an adult dog we [45:31] all know how energetic and playful such [45:34] young ups can be however just like human [45:36] children their behavior is also [45:38] complicated which is why they need so [45:40] much proper guidance what we must [45:42] remember when working with any dog of [45:44] any age is the basics make them aware of [45:47] the behavior that you don't like show [45:49] them what you would prefer them to do [45:51] and then rewarding them for the correct [45:53] behavior this means communicating with [45:56] the pup in a way that's very clear very [45:58] easy to understand resulting in an [46:01] improved relationship with your puppy as [46:03] he or she grows basic obedience for [46:05] puppies from the very beginning we want [46:08] to start shaping the puppy's behaviors [46:10] to help the puppy realize that his [46:12] behavior has an effect on his [46:14] environment operant conditioning as [46:16] explained in the earlier chapters below [46:18] is a list of some basic commands that [46:20] will help you have an easier more [46:22] pleasant life with your puppy you can [46:24] teach these two dogs of any age even [46:26] though these commands seem basic the [46:28] challenging part is achieving [46:30] reliability for instance [46:32] ensuring that your puppy will perform [46:34] these commands in spite of distractions [46:36] or new environments or whether or not [46:39] you're holding a treat in your hand [46:41] in actuality such reliability is not [46:44] difficult to teach once you're equipped [46:46] with the right tools and knowledge puppy [46:49] aggression among the puppies behavioral [46:51] issues aggressive problems are often the [46:54] most concerning for new owners a new [46:56] owner may even fear that the aggressive [46:58] behaviors are a sign of bad breeding or [47:01] a dog with psychological problems [47:03] however it's not always the case [47:05] often owners are teaching or reinforcing [47:08] aggressive behaviors without even [47:10] realizing it it's imperative to be aware [47:13] that a puppy may be using aggressive [47:15] behaviors as a way to get the desired [47:17] outcome by manipulating the owners this [47:20] is the important time to stop these [47:22] behaviors before they carry into [47:24] adulthood an example of accidentally [47:26] reinforcing an aggressive behavior could [47:29] be your puppy is on the couch you try to [47:31] get the puppy off the couch the puppy [47:34] growls so you leave the puppy on the [47:36] couch what next happens is that the [47:38] puppy grows up and this behavior has [47:40] become hardwired into adulthood while it [47:43] may have felt innocent or possibly even [47:46] cute when the dog was small and fluffy [47:47] the adult version of the puppy growling [47:50] from the couch is now threatening and [47:52] scary what should be done in this [47:54] situation is to act like you're not even [47:56] acknowledging the growl and then simply [47:58] get the puppy off the couch [48:00] this way the puppy learns that growling [48:02] doesn't work keep in mind that most [48:05] puppies are either trying to get some [48:07] results from their aggression or they [48:10] have fear aggression you will very [48:12] rarely encounter a puppy or even an [48:15] adult dog that is dominant aggressive [48:17] fear issues and puppies often a puppy [48:20] will go through a period of fearful [48:21] behavior sometimes known as the fear [48:24] period during this time the dog may [48:26] appear to be easily startled worrisome [48:29] and seemingly losing confidence there [48:32] are some important considerations [48:33] firstly it's not good to reinforce the [48:36] behavior by soothing or petting yet at [48:40] the same time it would not be good to [48:42] correct the dog as a punish [48:43] instead it's best to help the dog work [48:46] through this period by slowly exposing [48:49] them to the things that they are afraid [48:50] of showing them that they predict [48:52] something pleasant until they are [48:54] gradually regaining their confidence [48:56] potty training one of the first things [48:58] people want to teach their puppy is how [49:00] to be properly potty trained next I'm [49:03] gonna go over a simple step-by-step [49:05] process involving a crate that has just [49:08] big enough for the dog to stand up spin [49:11] around and lay down and not any larger [49:14] this will allow the dog to learn how to [49:16] hold their bladder how to crate train [49:18] your dog crate training is vital to [49:21] ensure your dog is housebroken [49:22] nobody wants a pet that poops if he is [49:25] constantly in the house this is [49:27] something that should be done [49:28] immediately after buying a new puppy or [49:30] an adult dog who is not housebroken [49:32] already the first guideline for crate [49:35] training is that you always want to make [49:36] the create a pleasant place for your dog [49:38] and never a place of punishment like as [49:40] a timeout or something of that sort the [49:43] second most important guideline is to [49:45] never put your dog in the crate only [49:47] when you're leaving the house or the dog [49:49] will learn that the crate means that you [49:51] are leaving and this can create anxiety [49:53] and further problems for the crate [49:55] training process here is a list of crate [49:58] to do's feed your dog in their crate [50:00] with the door closed put your dog into [50:03] the crate randomly throughout the day [50:05] even when you're not leaving the house [50:07] give your dog treats in the crate have [50:10] your dog sleep in the crate at night [50:11] depending on the age of the dog we have [50:14] to consider how long they can hold their [50:16] bladder a young pup at a couple of [50:18] months old should stay crated for a [50:20] couple of hours this timeframe can [50:22] become longer the older the dog is after [50:25] the time of the crate the puppy is taken [50:27] outside and given a chance to go potty [50:29] if they successfully go potty the dog [50:31] should be rewarded perhaps taken on a [50:34] walk we try to reinforce that the [50:36] bathroom breaks lead to more fun [50:38] activities [50:39] if the puppy doesn't go then he or she [50:41] is brought back into the crate we wait [50:44] twenty minutes and then we repeat the [50:46] process the important factor is to make [50:48] the dog associate going outside with [50:51] going potty and that it could be [50:53] something to look forward to [50:54] if the puppy happens to go [50:56] inside the house you don't need to rush [50:58] at it with a punishment behavior you [51:00] simply say no take the pup outside and [51:03] reward with positive reinforcement after [51:06] the pup goes potty in this situation the [51:09] puppy doesn't go potty [51:10] just like before the puppy goes back in [51:12] the crate and you repeat the process [51:13] until the puppy goes outside if the [51:16] puppy has gone potty in the house but [51:18] you did not catch them in the act [51:20] then you do not correct them you must [51:24] catch them immediately in the act or [51:26] they will not understand often people [51:28] will argue until they're blue in the [51:30] face that they can teach a dog not to go [51:32] potty in the house even if they catch [51:33] them after the fact however out of the [51:36] 10 times they corrected the dog for this [51:38] behavior one or two of the times they [51:40] actually caught the dog in the act and [51:42] that's when the dog learned here's an [51:44] analogy I like to explain to people to [51:46] get them to understand this concept [51:47] let's say you become a prisoner-of-war [51:49] in a foreign country where you don't [51:51] speak the same language and you have [51:53] your little prison cell with a toilet [51:55] that you use every day with no issues [51:57] one day you become bored and you start [52:00] to carve on the wall one of the guards [52:02] sees you carving on the wall and it runs [52:05] into your cell yelling at you in a [52:07] language you don't understand and they [52:09] take your face and they shove your face [52:11] into the toilet are you going to think [52:14] that they are shoving your face into the [52:16] toilet because you use the toilet or are [52:19] you gonna thank they're shoving your [52:20] face into the toilet because you were [52:23] carving on the wall because that's what [52:25] you were doing when they started yelling [52:27] at you it is a same for our dogs and our [52:29] puppies if your dog or puppy goes to the [52:32] bathroom inside the house and you do not [52:34] see them go to the bathroom and the dog [52:36] starts a different activity whatever [52:38] that activity may be if you start to [52:40] yell at your dog during that activity [52:42] and shove your dog's face into their own [52:44] mess they're going to think that you are [52:46] shoving their face into their own mess [52:48] because of the activity that they were [52:50] doing when you started yelling at them [52:52] so it's very important to keep this in [52:55] mind final note if the puppy goes potty [52:57] inside their potty training crate then [52:59] more likely than not it's your fault [53:01] dogs do not go potty where they sleep or [53:04] where they eat unless they simply cannot [53:06] hold it however if you find your puppy [53:09] going potty in the crate even though [53:11] you're giving your puppy many [53:12] opportunities to go outside then there [53:15] is a possibility that your dog has a UTI [53:17] and you should take them to your local [53:19] veterinarian socializing a puppy most [53:22] people think that socializing means [53:24] allowing your puppy to play with every [53:26] other dog in the area that's not [53:28] necessarily true [53:30] the important concept is to expose your [53:32] puppy to new environments people and [53:35] situations this allows the dog to become [53:38] well-adjusted and balanced but it's [53:41] important to control the situation as an [53:43] example we wouldn't want your new puppy [53:46] to be exposed to an aggressive dog at [53:48] the dog park [53:49] thus associating the park with that [53:52] confrontation the same can be said for [53:54] humans with poor skills around animals [53:56] therefore socializing a puppy is a [53:59] process that involves creating [54:00] situations to help your dog learn in a [54:03] positive way an example could be [54:05] exposing your dog to a friend who is a [54:07] knowledgeable dog owner who won't reward [54:10] your dog for jumping on them but will [54:12] instead reward the dog for sitting [54:14] reinforcing the positive obedience [54:16] training that you desire confidence [54:18] building contrary to popular belief as [54:21] we mentioned in the last chapter we do [54:23] not want a submissive dog and a dog's [54:26] mind [54:27] submission means look how small I am [54:29] please don't hurt me why would we ever [54:32] want our dogs to think that way rather [54:35] our aim is to have a confident dog such [54:38] a dog is much easier to teach new [54:40] behaviors to a dog that is willing to [54:42] try new things is much easier to Train [54:44] than a dog with fearful characteristics [54:46] the idea is to be on the same team as [54:49] your dog rather than having a [54:51] relationship based on fear or the belief [54:53] that the dog needs to be the alpha [54:55] adolescent dogs so you have a puppy and [54:58] it seemed like training was going great [55:00] from the beginning your puppy was [55:01] following you everywhere but now all of [55:03] a sudden your puppy is starting to [55:05] explore becoming more independent but is [55:08] also ignoring your commands this can be [55:10] frustrating for dog owners as they [55:12] discover their pups developing [55:14] personality in addition many of the [55:16] mistakes that owners may make while the [55:18] dog is a puppy can turn into serious [55:21] problems as the [55:22] it's older as an example the puppy [55:25] jumping up on your lap may have been [55:27] cute and it was rewarded for that [55:29] behavior but now your dog is growing [55:31] larger and has muddy paws now jumping on [55:34] you is potentially destructive this can [55:36] go for other behaviors such as pulling [55:38] on the leash is now knocking you down as [55:40] a result owners of adolescent dogs often [55:44] seek help from professional trainers [55:46] dealing with the common behavioral [55:48] problems listed earlier may seem more [55:50] intimidating as the dog grows in size [55:53] during that lessons it's important to [55:55] make the dog stay aware of the behavior [55:57] that you don't like showing them what [56:00] you'd prefer them to do and then [56:01] rewarding them for the correct behavior [56:03] this means communicating with the pup in [56:06] a way that's very clear very easy to [56:08] understand resulting in an improved [56:11] relationship with your adolescent dog as [56:13] he or she grows obedience training for [56:15] adolescence so you heard that it's best [56:17] to start training when your dog's a [56:19] puppy but now you've waited until your [56:21] dog's an adolescent don't worry this is [56:24] still a good time to start obedience [56:25] training in fact it's never too late to [56:28] start training the challenging part is [56:30] often achieving reliability even with [56:33] commands that seem basic as an example [56:36] ensuring that your dog will perform [56:38] these commands regardless of the new [56:40] environment or distractions or whether [56:42] or not there's a reward present in [56:44] actuality such reliability is not [56:46] difficult to teach once you're equipped [56:48] with the right tools and knowledge [56:50] adolescent aggression issues it's [56:53] important to take care of aggressive [56:54] issues while the dog is still adolescent [56:57] because these problems can become more [56:59] problematic as the dog ages and becomes [57:01] bigger and more intimidating as with [57:03] dogs of any age owners are teaching or [57:05] reinforcing aggressive behaviors without [57:08] even realizing it adolescent dogs as [57:10] with puppies may be using aggressive [57:13] behaviors as a way to get out of the [57:15] desired outcome by manipulating the [57:17] owner once a dog is an adolescent they [57:20] start to become a little bit more [57:21] intimidating compared to when they were [57:23] a puppy and so it may be easier to get [57:26] manipulated for example when you go to [57:28] Kylie or dog the dog growls and you back [57:31] away without finishing the job [57:32] well you just reinforced and aggressive [57:35] be [57:36] this can be a tricky situation given [57:38] that an owner must be mindful of [57:41] personal safety with a bigger dog [57:43] fortunately most of the time the dog is [57:46] still faking the behavior however there [57:49] is still a possibility that the dog will [57:51] bite so there's different ways to [57:52] approach this if you're running into [57:54] this issue it in touch with me or a [57:56] professional trainer in your area [57:58] adolescent fear issues often younger and [58:01] adolescent dogs will still be going [58:03] through a period of fearful behaviors [58:05] again often known as the fear period [58:08] during this time the dog may appear to [58:10] be easily startled worrisome and [58:12] seemingly losing confidence if your [58:15] adolescent dog is having fear problems [58:17] or still having such issues carrying [58:19] over from when they were a pup there are [58:21] some considerations to make one thing is [58:24] you don't want to reinforce the fearful [58:26] behavior such as petting them or suiting [58:29] them when they're acting fearful however [58:31] you don't want to correct the dog as if [58:33] you're punishing it for being afraid [58:35] which in turn would make it more afraid [58:38] one of the best strategies is to help [58:40] the dog work through the period by [58:41] introducing slow exposure to things they [58:44] are afraid of until the dog gradually [58:46] regains confidence socializing and [58:49] adolescent when your dog is an [58:51] adolescent it is still an excellent time [58:52] to start socializing even if your dog [58:55] hasn't been exposed to social activities [58:57] before socializing doesn't mean allowing [59:00] your dog to play with all the other dogs [59:02] in the neighborhood or jump on every [59:04] person that he or she sees the big idea [59:06] is to expose your dog to new situations [59:09] people and environments without always [59:11] necessarily having to go up to them and [59:14] constantly saying hi this leads to a dog [59:16] that adjusts for many cases and has a [59:19] balanced personality but as always it's [59:22] important to control the situation as an [59:24] example we wouldn't want your adolescent [59:26] dog to be exposed to aggressive dogs at [59:28] your nearby park again associating that [59:31] park with the confrontation your dog [59:33] should also avoid humans that have poor [59:36] skills around animals as before you can [59:39] try bringing your dog around other [59:40] well-behaved dogs and owners who [59:43] reinforce positive behaviors and [59:45] activities that you think your dog might [59:47] enjoy adult dogs [59:49] a lot of people start running into new [59:51] issues with their dogs around two years [59:53] of age these issues arrives because it's [59:55] when the dog begins to enter a state of [59:57] maturity which means it now feels that [60:00] it may be able to challenge existing [60:02] rules so what once seemed like a [60:05] well-trained dog now feels larger and [60:07] could be more difficult to control this [60:09] is not always the case though you might [60:11] just want to sharpen up your dog's [60:13] obedience adult dogs behavioral issues [60:15] younger dogs can seem easier to control [60:18] and easier to work with but now your [60:20] adult dog can seem overwhelming [60:22] behaviors your dog may not have done [60:24] before may start to arise or previous [60:27] issues have now progressively gotten [60:29] worse over time another issue is that [60:31] some of the obedience related issues of [60:33] a younger dog such as taking your dog on [60:36] a walk and he or she lunges at people [60:37] who passes by once may not have seemed [60:40] like such a big issue because the dog [60:42] was smaller now runs the risk of [60:45] actually scaring people while on your [60:47] walk a misconception is that an adult [60:50] dog is too old to learn new behaviors or [60:52] overcome obedience issues fortunately [60:55] that's not true in fact some adult dogs [60:58] can seem to learn more quickly compared [61:00] to some puppies the concept for training [61:03] an adult dog remains the same which is [61:05] ensuring the dog is aware of the [61:07] behavior that you don't like showing [61:09] them the preferred behavior and then [61:10] providing rewards based on the obedient [61:13] behaviors you desire as always it's [61:15] about proper communication with your dog [61:17] which is a big part of my training [61:19] philosophy basic obedience for adults a [61:22] dog doesn't have to be a puppy to [61:24] remember valuable obedience training [61:26] this is good news if you have an adult [61:28] dog or if you neglected to do training [61:31] when they were a puppy or adolescent [61:33] this is still a good time to start [61:34] working on some of the basic obedience [61:36] commands outlined in this book a lot of [61:39] times dogs run into problems when they [61:41] don't have a job to perform this can be [61:43] a good thing since dogs are unable to [61:45] multitask when you begin obedience [61:48] training they are now focusing on their [61:50] new job and are unable to act out some [61:53] of the more problematic behaviors from [61:55] before a lot of times adult dogs run [61:57] into problems when they don't have a job [61:59] to perform this can be a good thing [62:00] since dogs are unable [62:02] to multitask when you begin obedience [62:04] training they're now focusing on their [62:06] new job and they're unable to act out [62:09] the problematic behaviors from before [62:11] it's important to achieve reliability [62:13] even with basic commands for instance [62:16] make sure that your dog understands the [62:18] commands even in new potentially [62:20] distracting situations or when a visible [62:23] reward is taken away teach and [62:25] reliability is part of the training [62:27] process and it's not as difficult as you [62:29] may think so long as you are equipped [62:31] with the right knowledge and tools [62:33] socializing adult dogs at any age it's [62:37] important to begin socializing your dog [62:39] this is not just about allowing your dog [62:41] to play with other dogs and meet all [62:43] your friends but getting them [62:44] comfortable around new dogs new people [62:46] and new surroundings [62:47] however with adult dogs some owners [62:50] encounter difficulties with socialising [62:52] based on their dog's unique personality [62:54] some adult dogs just don't like other [62:57] dogs very much unlike puppies who seem [63:00] excited with everybody the same way that [63:03] some people just don't like other people [63:05] this doesn't mean that if your dog [63:06] doesn't like other dogs social [63:08] encounters should be avoided all [63:09] together but you should provide exposure [63:12] to other dogs without forcing the [63:14] interaction in any case as always you [63:17] want to make sure the situation is [63:18] controlled by you the owner you don't [63:21] want your dog to have a bad experience [63:22] with other dogs humans or particular [63:25] situations leading to negative [63:27] associations and further problems in the [63:30] future [63:30] socializing is about introducing [63:32] positive experiences for your dog and [63:35] with an adult dog it becomes even more [63:37] apparent what your dog likes and doesn't [63:39] like so consider what activities are [63:41] best matched for your dog's [63:43] personalities senior dogs they say an [63:46] old dog can't learn new tricks but [63:48] that's not true sometimes a dog in his [63:50] or her senior years is really looking [63:53] for a job or something to do and [63:54] obedience training for a healthy senior [63:56] dog may be perfect behavioral issues [63:59] with a senior dog while many senior dogs [64:01] can have lower energy behavioral [64:03] problems can still occur that were not [64:04] fixed at any earlier stages in their [64:06] lives this includes all the common [64:09] elements addressed for all other age [64:10] groups [64:11] as with adult dogs senior dogs can also [64:14] present intimidating factors with [64:16] certain unchecked behaviors for instance [64:18] lunging at bypassers on the leash can be [64:21] intimidating and scary for those subject [64:23] to it in comparison to when these [64:25] actions occurred when your dog was just [64:27] a little puppy there are some variables [64:29] to keep in mind for senior dogs [64:31] sometimes new behaviors happen in their [64:34] older years that were not previously [64:36] seen this may be health-related and [64:38] caused by a change in the dog's body or [64:40] mind for instance sudden urination in [64:43] the house could be the result of a [64:45] bladder disorder or unusual behaviors [64:48] that can be the result of psychological [64:50] issues [64:50] it's suggested to consult with a [64:53] veterinarian if your senior dog is [64:54] suddenly behaving hot however for [64:57] long-standing behavioral issues a [64:59] trainer would be your best option even a [65:01] senior dog can learn new behaviors and [65:04] retain obedience training a [65:05] misconception is that a senior dog is [65:08] too old to acquire new habits and [65:10] overcome obedience issues fortunately [65:13] that's not true in fact some adult dogs [65:15] and even senior dogs can learn more [65:18] quickly and compared to some puppies [65:19] when training your senior dog it's all [65:22] about helping the dog become aware of [65:23] the behaviors you were displeased with [65:25] and guiding them to lead them to [65:27] preferred practices which can be done [65:29] through rewards the trick is proper [65:32] communication with your dog basic [65:34] obedience for senior dogs senior dogs [65:36] are more willing than you think to start [65:38] their obedience training in fact it can [65:40] give a dog who is less active a renewed [65:42] level of energy as with adult dogs [65:45] senior dogs in particular sometimes [65:47] desire a new job and a sense of duty [65:49] which by itself can fix many behavioral [65:52] problems this is because dogs are unable [65:54] to multitask [65:56] therefore when you begin obedience [65:58] training they're now focusing on their [66:00] new job and are unable to act out the [66:03] problematic behaviors from before part [66:05] of the process of mastering obedience [66:07] training is achieving a reliability even [66:10] with basic commands this means ensuring [66:12] your dog understands the commands even [66:14] in distracting situations or when the [66:17] reward is taken away [66:18] I believe in reinforcing reliability as [66:21] part of the training process it can be [66:23] easily achieved with the right [66:24] knowledge and tools socializing senior [66:27] dogs it's important even for senior dogs [66:29] to have socializing experiences this [66:32] includes both exposing your dog to other [66:34] dogs and owners alike but also getting [66:37] them comfortable in different types of [66:38] situations to ensure your dog's balanced [66:41] behavior senior dogs are even more [66:43] likely to have issues with other dogs [66:45] based on their naturally engrained [66:47] personality and the clashes of such [66:49] personalities however despite this fact [66:52] it's still important for the dog to be [66:54] exposed to social encounters so they [66:56] maintain their doggy social skills as [66:58] with dogs of all other ages listed thus [67:01] far it's important to make sure the [67:03] owner controls the situation this means [67:05] avoiding bad experiences that could make [67:07] your dog react poorly to social [67:09] situations this can include exposure to [67:12] misbehaving dogs or humans who are not [67:15] good with animals most importantly [67:18] socialization is about creating positive [67:20] experiences for your canine your senior [67:23] dog will make it clear what he or she [67:25] likes or doesn't so try to judge the [67:28] best experiences based on your dog's [67:30] personality your training lesson if you [67:33] had scheduled a lesson with me this [67:34] section consists of an in-depth look at [67:37] the mean potatoes of that lesson will [67:40] cover the science behind teaching your [67:41] dog any command your 8 steps to success [67:44] with your dog step 1 [67:46] teaching markers remember this is also [67:49] engagement training you are paying or [67:52] rewarding your dog for focusing their [67:54] attention on you so during this exercise [67:56] you're teaching your dog a few things [67:58] you're teaching them the communication [68:00] channels and you are teaching them that [68:02] it's a good thing to look at you the [68:04] exercise goes as follows you get the [68:07] dog's attention once your dog is looking [68:09] at you you use your continuation marker [68:12] and then you deliver the reward once [68:14] your dog eats the reward and looks back [68:16] at you [68:17] you are going to use your terminal [68:18] marker move away encouraging your dog to [68:21] come to you to get the reward you will [68:24] continue to do this exercise until your [68:26] dog is conditioned to both of these [68:28] markers step 2 shaping desired behaviors [68:31] during the step you will begin to teach [68:33] your dog desired behaviors using either [68:36] these pressure [68:37] or luring this is called shaping before [68:40] we can name a command the dog must first [68:42] understand through a physical cue what [68:45] we want and expect from them you will [68:47] continue to carry out this step until [68:49] your dog is performing each position in [68:51] a way that you would like them to step 3 [68:53] name the behaviors once we have our dog [68:57] perform the action with our physical cue [68:59] it is then time to name the command [69:01] remember you must say the name of the [69:03] command and then show your dog the [69:05] physical signal a common mistake that [69:08] most people make is when they decide to [69:10] name the command they will say the [69:11] command while they are giving the dog [69:13] the physical cue if you pair your [69:15] physical with your verbal the physical [69:18] will override that verbal and become the [69:20] only cue for the behavior an example of [69:22] this could be as simple as saying good [69:24] boy or the marker that trainers would [69:26] prefer to use yes at the exact same time [69:29] when they feed the dog the reward by [69:31] mixing the two actions together the [69:33] verbal cue no longer has relevance in [69:35] the dog's mind if we want the dog to [69:37] learn the verbal command then it is [69:40] important to make sure that the verbal [69:41] precedes the physical cue I split second [69:45] remember everything must be predictable [69:47] for our dogs in order for them to learn [69:49] so the process becomes command motivate [69:52] mark and reward in that order so you say [69:55] sit then you lift your hand once the [69:58] dog's butt hits the ground you mark and [70:00] then reward you will continue to use the [70:02] physical cues until the dog beats you to [70:04] it [70:05] meaning if you say sit and before you [70:08] lift your hand the dog is already [70:10] sitting now you know the dog knows the [70:12] behavior on the verbal command alone [70:15] step 4 teaching leash pressure this is [70:18] how you'll teach your dog to turn off [70:20] pressure by complying put a leash and [70:22] collar on your dog and start to pull the [70:23] dog in one direction when your dog puts [70:26] on the brakes continue to pull until the [70:28] dog moves with the pressure on the leash [70:30] once he moves with the pressure you will [70:32] immediately release the pressure and [70:34] then reward your dog you will place your [70:36] dog in all the obedience positions using [70:39] leech pressure only you can also use [70:42] food to help make the process much [70:44] easier for you and your dog be sure to [70:47] check out my youtube video titled speed [70:49] up your dog's training [70:50] with leash pressure episode 16 for a sit [70:53] you will apply slow steady pressure [70:55] upwards until your dog sits for it down [70:58] you will apply slow steady pressure [71:00] downward until your dog lays down elbows [71:02] touching the ground for the heel you [71:05] will use leash pressure to guide your [71:07] dog into the heel position anytime you [71:10] use leash pressure it is imperative to [71:12] turn off the pressure once your dog [71:14] makes the decision to go into the [71:15] position step 5 [71:17] teach the stay command using leash [71:19] pressure once your dog knows all the [71:22] leash pressure cues you can now start [71:24] using it for your state's place your dog [71:27] in a position of your choice the moment [71:29] your dog breaks the position you will [71:31] calmly say one know casually walk to [71:34] your dog grab the leash and use the [71:36] leash pressure to place your dog back [71:39] into the position that was just broken [71:40] you must say no the moment your dog [71:44] breaks the position and you must only [71:46] use one no for each offense even if it [71:50] takes you a few minutes to get your dog [71:52] back to the position that they just [71:53] broke you will continue to do this step [71:56] until your dog goes back to the position [71:58] they just broke on their own after you [72:01] say no this will prove that your dog [72:03] knows what is expected and that your dog [72:06] knows how to turn off pressure by [72:07] complying as a side note when teaching [72:10] us day we do not say stay the stay is [72:14] implied when you put your dog into a [72:16] commanded position step 6 [72:18] teach reliability by adding correction [72:21] this move will ensure reliability in [72:24] your commands now when your dog breaks a [72:27] stay command you will say one note but [72:30] instead of using leash pressure you will [72:32] give your dog a correction with a [72:34] training collar even if your dog goes [72:36] back to the position on their own after [72:39] you give the correction you will then [72:41] command your dog to go back to the [72:43] behavior position that was just broken [72:45] step 7 safely using a remote collar [72:48] again I do not advocate the use of [72:51] remote collar training in the event [72:53] however that you are required to use one [72:56] it's important to understand how they [72:57] work so they can be used safely first [73:00] it's important to make sure that your [73:02] dog is direct [73:04] to the remote training collar before you [73:06] use it without the leash so for the [73:08] first two weeks minimum you're going to [73:10] pair the leash pops with the stimulation [73:12] from the collar meaning the moment the [73:14] leash pops you will press the button on [73:16] the collar to give your dog the [73:17] correction this will help show the dog [73:20] that you are giving the correction and [73:22] that the collar is not just some random [73:24] bug biting them on the neck after two [73:27] weeks of pairing the remote correction [73:29] with the leash pop you will test it to [73:31] see if your dog has become directional [73:33] to the collar which means your dog [73:35] understands that it's a correction you [73:38] will place your dog on a climb command [73:40] without a leash you will wait till your [73:42] dog breaks the command the second your [73:44] dog jumps off the command you will say [73:46] one no followed by correction with the [73:49] remote training collar your dog will do [73:51] one of three things either freeze after [73:54] it's been corrected or go back to the [73:56] climb signifying that the dog is [73:58] directional or the dog will come running [74:01] to you showing that they are not [74:03] directional if your dog comes running to [74:05] you you will not continue to correct you [74:08] will place the leash back on your dog [74:10] and you will continue to pair it the [74:11] collar with the leash for another week [74:13] at which point you will again attempt to [74:16] see if your dog is directional once your [74:17] dog is directional you have then reached [74:19] the status of off leash trained [74:21] things to keep in mind when using a [74:24] remote collar one do not keep a remote [74:27] collar on your dog for longer than eight [74:29] hours - do not leave a remote collar on [74:33] your dog when you're not supervising [74:34] them three always check your dog's neck [74:38] when you remove the collar to ensure [74:40] that your dog hasn't had an allergic [74:42] reaction to the collar four make sure [74:45] the collar is on and charged before [74:48] placing it on your dog five unless you [74:51] have advanced training on the remote [74:52] collar do not use the continuation [74:55] button six be mindful of the collars [74:58] setting do not accidentally shock your [75:00] dog at a very high level when you should [75:02] or should not correct your dog with the [75:04] remote collar there are times when you [75:06] can correct your dog with the remote [75:07] collar even when your dog isn't [75:09] directional yet and that's for behavior [75:11] is unrelated to obedience you can use it [75:14] to stop [75:15] unwanted behavioral issues such as they [75:17] came getting into the trash for any [75:19] other unruly behavior mentioned [75:21] previously the second your dog starts to [75:24] dig or put its nose into the garbage you [75:26] can activate the collar this creates an [75:29] unpleasant association to the [75:30] problematic behavior however the [75:33] important thing to remember is never to [75:35] correct your dog with the remote collar [75:37] if your dog is meeting a new dog or [75:39] people you do not want your dog to think [75:41] that it is the other person or the other [75:43] dog that is causing the correction from [75:45] the collar if you do there is a [75:47] possibility that the dog will develop [75:49] aggression so be mindful of that in [75:52] addition as explained before the remote [75:55] collar is only used for creating [75:56] reliability with all of the obedience [75:58] commands so long as the dog is [76:00] directional to the collar lastly this [76:03] should go without saying but never use [76:05] the remote collar on your dog in an [76:08] attempt to stop fearful behaviors as [76:10] mentioned before this would only make [76:12] the fear worse teach your dog to be [76:15] proactive at this point your dog has [76:17] likely become reactive in the presence [76:19] of rewards remember a reactive dog these [76:23] are dogs whose behaviors are actually [76:25] being driven by the report and a [76:27] proactive dog is a dog that understands [76:30] that their behavior can create or make [76:33] the production of a reward dogs are [76:35] either reactive or proactive and our [76:37] goal is the later there is a simple [76:40] proven process you can use to make your [76:42] dog proactive the first step involves [76:45] teaching your dog the markers the [76:46] condition reinforcers at which point you [76:49] can start training your dog to be [76:50] proactive what you will want to do the [76:52] next few weeks is always have a reward [76:54] handy such as a treat or a toy but your [76:57] dog must not know that you have the [76:58] reward when you lay your dog out of the [77:01] room or create you will wait - your dog [77:02] looks at you the moment your dog looks [77:05] at you you will mark that behavior and [77:07] then pull out a reward in other words [77:09] your dog didn't see the reward but your [77:11] dog looking at you is what made the [77:13] reward come out you can also use free [77:15] shaping to help teach your dog to be [77:17] proactive any time your dog does [77:19] something that you like such as sitting [77:21] or going to their bed you would mark [77:23] that behavior and then reward them if [77:26] you do this enough eventually [77:27] we'll start to act out behaviors they [77:30] believe can get them a reward this is [77:32] going to teach your dog that they can [77:34] make things happen for themselves this [77:36] is part of that operant conditioning and [77:38] this becomes a much easier dog to train [77:41] now you have a dog that is actively [77:43] working to materialize the rewards that [77:46] they want what types of food in treats [77:48] to feed your dog during the training [77:50] process I recommend using a high quality [77:53] dry food this way your dog's dog food [77:56] can be their training treat this is a [77:58] healthier and cheaper option than using [78:00] the store-bought sugar-filled dog treats [78:02] you can also use freeze-dried dog treats [78:05] or even cheese or slice hot dogs a [78:07] reward that your dog enjoys is going to [78:10] make the training much easier now [78:12] freeze-dried dog treats is an ideal [78:14] choice but it can be quite expensive [78:17] that's why we will often use the dog's [78:20] kibble for the training process however [78:23] if you're looking for the best choice [78:24] possible for your dog's diet then I [78:27] would recommend a five-star premium raw [78:29] dog food your dog needs a lot of water [78:32] to stay fit and healthy and many dogs on [78:34] dry food are slightly dehydrated [78:36] since dry food is only around 18% [78:39] moisture in comparison to raw at 70% [78:42] moisture to learn more about dog food I [78:45] would recommend checking out dog food [78:47] advisor com or you can order a book on [78:50] how to prepare homemade pet food called [78:52] dr.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 420/468,Becker's real food for healthy dogs [78:55] and cats simple homemade food lastly I [79:00] would recommend checking out the [79:01] documentary pet fooled that's fo LED pet [79:06] fooled recommended treats for your dog I [79:09] don't recommend many store-bought treats [79:11] which are rarely healthy for your dog [79:13] just read the ingredients to see what I [79:15] mean lots of animal by-products and [79:17] factory floor scrapings instead you're [79:20] better off making your own treats or [79:22] using premium ingredients for example [79:25] freeze-dried treats bully sticks bones [79:29] from a butcher always raw and never [79:31] cooked a bone are calm filled with a raw [79:34] dog food or premium canned dog food and [79:37] then fro [79:37] for a tasty frozen treat let's say your [79:39] dog enjoys running away from you this is [79:42] a common problem that a lot of people [79:44] will end up having and it's not [79:45] difficult to fix first you want to teach [79:48] the behavior using the science behind [79:50] training a dog to perform any command [79:52] once your dog knows come when cold you [79:54] can start working on building the habit [79:56] of always coming to you by practicing [79:59] the training every day but let's say [80:01] your dog is in your backyard or at the [80:03] park and doesn't have a training collar [80:04] on and no way for you to get your dog to [80:06] come to you by force your dog knows [80:09] there's no collar on him and he decides [80:11] to run away from you instead of coming [80:13] to you many people will instinctively [80:16] chase their dog but this only makes it [80:19] worse as your dog is likely to think [80:20] that you are playing a game instead of [80:23] chasing your dog you should playfully [80:25] run away from your dog this will usually [80:27] turn the game around and it will have [80:29] your dog chasing you instead once your [80:31] dog gets to you do not end the game by [80:34] quickly grabbing them but instead [80:36] continue the game by pushing them away [80:38] from you in a playful manner when you do [80:41] decide to end the game make sure you [80:42] reward your dog as this will encourage [80:45] your dog to come to you because it [80:47] predicts play instead of avoiding you to [80:50] prevent a correction how to stop a dog [80:52] fight unfortunately if you own a dog [80:54] there is a possibility that your dog may [80:57] end up in a dog fight the important [80:59] thing is knowing what to do if the [81:01] situation arises what most people do in [81:04] a panic is they try to pull the dogs [81:06] apart by the scruff around the dog's [81:07] neck or even they try to hit them hoping [81:10] that will get them to stop fighting [81:12] grabbing them by the neck is not only [81:14] dangerous for the humans but if you try [81:17] to pull them apart that way you can [81:18] often end up causing more damage to both [81:21] of the dogs if you try hitting the dogs [81:23] hoping that will stop the fight [81:25] it may just add fuel to the fire and [81:27] increase the struggle since they'll be [81:30] thinking that it could be the other dog [81:31] causing the additional pain the best [81:34] course of action is to try and stay calm [81:36] and target the dog that is being the [81:38] aggressor you will then grab the scruff [81:41] on the dog's lower back by the base of [81:44] the tail [81:44] you will then lift the dog up by that [81:47] scrub until the dog lets go the other [81:49] dog if the dog doesn't [81:51] go the other dog then you would twist [81:53] the dog's scruff to make the dog let go [81:55] be cautious though because it is [81:58] possible that some dogs may redirect the [82:01] aggression on the human that is grabbing [82:03] the scruff even though this isn't a [82:06] perfect solution and anytime a dog gets [82:08] into a fight there is the possibility of [82:11] a dog being injured or the person being [82:13] bitten however if you do it the way I [82:16] just described you will have a much [82:18] higher chance of stopping the fight and [82:20] coming out of it without an injury to [82:21] the dog or yourself last option is to [82:24] grab the dog's hind legs lift up and [82:27] pull away I don't always like using this [82:30] option I prefer grabbing the scrum [82:32] because I'm worried about hurting the [82:33] dog's legs by grabbing them and lifting [82:36] them up this is a common technique used [82:38] by many shelters I have used a technique [82:42] of grabbing the scruff when dog fights [82:44] have broken out around me and it has [82:46] worked for me every single time but when [82:49] I do it the dogs often do turn around to [82:52] see what is grabbing them and I have had [82:55] dogs mouth my arm without biting but [82:58] again as mentioned before there is [83:00] always the possibility of being bitten [83:02] if you are trying to separate a dog [83:04] fight in conclusion dog training is an [83:08] art form and it takes years to become an [83:10] expert however through the essentials we [83:12] provided in this manual anybody can take [83:15] their dog ownership to the next level [83:17] right away although you won't master [83:19] this field overnight you can quickly [83:21] develop at least the essential skills [83:23] needed to fix the majority of issues [83:25] that dog owners face in addition you'll [83:28] discover a greater relationship with [83:30] your dog as you now have the tools to [83:32] address the bad behaviors that may have [83:34] frustrated you or pushed you further [83:37] away from your companion [83:38] I believe that improving the

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 423/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we're going to be [00:01] teaching our dogs and exercise so I like [00:03] to call solidifying the heel position [00:15] this is a great exercise if you plan on [00:17] doing competition obedience but it's [00:20] also good for service dog training [00:21] because if you have a service dog you [00:23] want that dog to be able to find the [00:25] heel position no matter where they are [00:27] so the concept of this exercise is you [00:30] want to be able to place your dog in any [00:31] position and call them into heel [00:34] position now my videos are designed to [00:37] be watched in order so if you see my [00:39] videos up to this point you could jump [00:41] to this time in the video [00:44] but if you're new to my video series [00:46] then there's a couple exercises then you [00:48] want to be able to complete before you [00:50] do this exercise so the first one is you [00:54] want to make sure your dog is [00:55] conditioned to the markers now what is a [00:57] marker it's a word or sound that [00:58] predicts a reward because when our dog [01:00] does a behavior we have one second to [01:03] let them know that that's a behavior we [01:04] want them to repeat so when they do that [01:06] behavior we either have to give them the [01:09] primary reinforcer which is the food toy [01:12] or affection or the conditioned [01:14] reinforcer a conditioned reinforcer [01:16] predicts the primary reinforcer for [01:19] example our yes sound predicts the [01:22] reward so when our dog does does the [01:24] behavior if I can get the reward to my [01:26] dog within one second of them completing [01:29] that behavior I can use the primary [01:31] reinforcer if I'm unable to get the [01:34] reward to my dog within a second I use [01:36] the conditioned reinforcer to help me [01:38] get that reward to my dog within one [01:41] second even before I start a training [01:43] exercise one of the things that I like [01:45] to do before every single one of my [01:47] training sessions is a short quick [01:49] session of engagement range art so what [01:52] I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get her to [01:54] look straight up at my face now in the [01:56] very beginning when we start this [01:57] exercise we hold the food by our face [01:59] because our dog is looking at our hands [02:01] so we're gonna go yes and then reward [02:04] when we do this remember we want to make [02:07] sure that the sound comes before the [02:09] reward if I do this yes my dog will [02:13] never become conditioned to the sound I [02:15] have to make sure I say yes before I [02:18] deliver the reward then I'm going to use [02:20] my terminal marker for me I used the [02:22] word three you can use whatever word you [02:24] like so I'm gonna get back in that six [02:27] on position shooter back and then I'm [02:32] gonna go free and then I'm gonna move [02:34] back to give her the reward good girl [02:37] three and then move back encouraging her [02:40] to come get the reward again make sure [02:42] you don't pair don't do this free which [02:45] is a common mistake stay the word before [02:48] the physical cue yes free [02:53] and then if I want to take it to the [02:56] next level and I want to make it a [02:58] little bit more advanced I'll start to [03:00] get my dog to look at my face in order [03:03] to get the marker and not my hands in a [03:05] way that I do that is I bring one hand [03:07] out if my dog was to follow this hand I [03:09] wouldn't reward her I want her looking [03:11] at my face yes then I would bring the [03:14] food down and reward her then I do it [03:16] with the other hand I go out if she [03:18] looks at my face yes then I reward her [03:20] then I do both hands again I still want [03:24] her to look at my face yes and then I [03:26] reward then maybe I move my hands a [03:30] little bit so now I'm moving them and I [03:32] need extra distractions see she's [03:34] getting distracted a little bit but [03:36] maybe that's hard right now so good [03:39] she's still watching excellent free and [03:44] then I mark and reward so that's going [03:47] to get our dog to understand it's [03:48] looking at our face that's getting that [03:50] reward which is going to help with some [03:51] of the more advanced exercises so make [03:54] sure your dog's condition to those [03:55] markers the next thing is you want to [03:57] make sure you've done power-steering [03:58] with your dog so power-steering all that [04:01] is is we're gonna cut the food in our [04:03] hand and when we turn our hand our dog [04:06] follows it so I have a video just on [04:08] power steering but you want to be able [04:10] to get your dog to pivot around in place [04:12] either way you want to be able to [04:16] control them with one hand so guiding [04:18] them in the heel getting them to do [04:20] spins whatever it is we want to be able [04:23] to control them with simply using boring [04:27] food and that concept of power steering [04:31] so now we have that in place another [04:33] thing that I like to teach before doing [04:35] this exercise is to teach our dogs to [04:37] walk backwards you can see there's a lot [04:39] of steps to get to one exercise so a [04:43] quick reminder on getting our dogs to [04:45] walk backwards [04:46] for this I hold my hand as a fist that's [04:49] going to be the cue for my dog to walk [04:51] backwards once she starts to walk [04:53] backwards I mark [04:54] in the beginning all we need is one [04:56] maybe two steps as they get better then [04:59] we can have them walk backwards farther [05:01] and farther she's trying to go into [05:03] field position right there [05:04] so fists walk towards their free reward [05:08] this walk towards her I drop the piece [05:11] try not to drop too many free free very [05:18] good free good so now I have a walking [05:28] backwards and in order to get she went [05:31] to jump backwards because I said [05:32] backwards in order to use these [05:34] behaviors in the exercise solidify in [05:36] the heel position you don't have to have [05:38] it on a verbal command you just have to [05:39] be able to get your dog to do it with [05:41] the physical cue so now we have those [05:44] the next one is teaching our dog to get [05:46] in the heel position again I have a [05:48] video on this but there's two ways that [05:50] people teach it one is the dog swings [05:52] around into heel position and the other [05:55] option is to go around the body in the [06:00] field position so one's called a flip [06:03] finish and the other one's called a bi [06:05] finish should try to go center there [06:08] that's gonna happen no big deal alright [06:10] so now we have all these in place now [06:12] we're going to solidify the heel [06:14] position alright fine [06:15] all we need to do for that is we find a [06:17] position and if your dog is still on the [06:20] earlier stages you can help them out by [06:22] using the food but what we want to do is [06:24] we want to get to a position you want to [06:26] stop moving we're gonna say the command [06:29] then we're going to help our dog so now [06:31] that I'm here I'm gonna say deal and [06:34] then if I need to I can help guide her [06:36] in the position then I would mark and [06:38] reward climb okay so then I would find [06:42] another position maybe right here and [06:45] then I would say heel and she goes into [06:49] he'll climb good girl [06:53] I didn't say keep doing heel one good [06:56] girl you can also leave your dog in the [07:00] sit where they are in the heel position [07:02] and you can move to another position so [07:04] for example I could do something like [07:05] this Kim [07:09] all right yeah she's so happy about it [07:18] yeah I'd seen it's a little bit of help [07:21] heal good girl and then what I could do [07:26] is I can leave her in that position and [07:30] I can come around to the other side and [07:31] call her heal and to heal and have her [07:34] swing around to the other side down if [07:37] you're having a hard time keeping your [07:38] dog in a sit-stay but downstate tends to [07:41] be a little bit easier so then we find [07:43] another position heal she anticipated [07:47] that one damn that's okay it happens [07:50] damn I could even shift to the side heel [07:57] damn chill down chill down you [08:16] um seal down three so you can see when [08:26] she's getting into heel position I'm not [08:28] having a mark right now I'm just giving [08:30] her the food the moment she gets into [08:32] the position so in this situation I'm [08:34] using the primary reinforcer to reward [08:37] her for the behavior again remember you [08:39] have to either get the conditioned [08:40] reinforcer or the primary reinforcer to [08:43] your dog within a second he'll so I [08:48] could go free and reward her and let her [08:51] jump and get that reward [08:54] all right so I'm in position and at [08:57] first I'm gonna have some food in my [08:58] hand I'm gonna stand pretty straight and [09:00] I'm gonna call her into the heel [09:02] position then I'm gonna help her to get [09:04] into that position if I need to the [09:07] first time I do this I could step back [09:08] just like when I first taught the heel [09:10] position or if my dog is doing a little [09:13] bit better a little bit more advanced I [09:14] could just stand here and use that power [09:16] student so let's see how it goes with [09:18] Hardin barley heel as I said the command [09:22] and wait for her to flip in a position [09:24] yes and then I give her the reward I [09:26] could also Bri use the terminal marker [09:32] and let her get up then I'm gonna find [09:34] another position so now I might face her [09:37] or I could even stand this way so now [09:39] she has to swing around my body to get [09:41] into that position so again I'm gonna go [09:44] Harley [09:44] heel wait till she gets into that [09:47] perfect position or at least where I [09:50] want her to beat mark and reward and [09:52] then guide her back to the climb and [09:54] then guide her back you can use the [09:57] terminal market terminal marker is a [09:58] good option because remember speed is [10:00] based on motivation so your dog learns a [10:03] faster they get to the position the [10:04] faster they get to jump up and get their [10:06] reward then they'll they usually tend to [10:09] do it a little bit more quickly okay so [10:10] now I'm going to call her in the heel [10:12] and I want her to be able to swing [10:13] around and find that heel position [10:16] parley heal so she's gonna come around [10:19] using that power steering to help her [10:22] out free and then I'm gonna reward I'm [10:26] gonna face forward and I'm gonna call [10:27] her [10:28] Harley heal once she gets in a he'll [10:30] free good girl very nice brick good girl [10:35] so now what I'm going to do for this one [10:37] I like to do this with all the dogs [10:39] she likes the center position is I'll [10:41] put them on my right side and then I'll [10:43] call them into Harley heel in the heel [10:47] position [10:50] we're gonna place our dog into the yield [10:51] position then we're going to step out of [10:53] it [10:53] sit repeat the sit command step away [10:57] then when you're in a new position [10:59] you're gonna call your dog back into the [11:01] heel position so just like this heel you [11:04] can help him out if you need to with [11:06] that power steering sit yes heel yes [11:21] good girl sit heel yes so it's really [11:30] shown them how to gain the heel position [11:32] from any other position even if I come [11:35] around and I place her on the wrong side [11:41] heel she's gonna flip around into the [11:46] other heel position sit if I go in front [11:51] of her heel good girl sit or even if I [11:58] step back a little bit she did it early [12:03] set no sit alright sit thank you you [12:14] good and get her to shift back into [12:17] position so these are going to be the [12:20] simple steps to get our dog to do the [12:23] exercise that I like to call solidifying [12:25] the heel position it's important to make [12:27] sure you can get your dog to find that [12:28] position from any position it's going to [12:31] greatly improve your heel command but [12:34] it's also fun exercise to do

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 426/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey guys make shomer here today we're [00:02] gonna be teaching our dog is the big [00:04] trick what this is it's a simple [00:05] exercise where our dog is going to weave [00:07] in and out of our legs as we walk [00:09] there's two different options one word [00:11] we have only vest we want the other [00:13] option you stand still and we simply [00:15] change our legs give them enough space [00:17] to weave in and out I'm gonna teach Ari [00:20] how to weave while I walk and I'm gonna [00:23] teach Charlie to do it when I'm standing [00:25] still I want to see if you guys can do [00:27] this with your dogs as well in about one [00:29] month I'm gonna repost how they're [00:31] performing this technique if you guys [00:33] send me a video with your dog [00:35] I'll share it on my channel alright [00:37] let's get into it all right like I said [00:50] we're gonna be teaching our dogs the [00:51] leap trick so I'm gonna start with Ari [00:54] now with all my videos it's created to [00:57] be followed step by step in the series [00:59] so if there's certain questions that you [01:01] may have like how do I teach the markers [01:03] or how do I start getting my dog off of [01:06] the rewards so we're not having to [01:07] reward the dog every single time however [01:13] when we are doing this any time I'm [01:15] teaching a dog a new command I start [01:18] with what's known as continual [01:19] reinforcement meaning every single time [01:22] the dog performs the behavior I reward [01:25] them so I want to get them to understand [01:27] that there's something invaluable in it [01:29] for them so when every single command we [01:31] do we teach our dog we first start off [01:33] with the physical cue I'm not going to [01:35] be naming the command I want to make [01:37] sure I can get Ari to weave in and out [01:39] of my links so I'm gonna bring her over [01:41] here and what I like to do is I like to [01:44] guy my dog first into a heel position [01:47] then I'm gonna step forward with my [01:49] right leg guiding her underneath using [01:51] my food to walk so I'm gonna use [01:54] and our mark and reward if I wasn't [01:57] talking didn't re try not to drop too [01:59] many pieces so you see girl all I'm [02:05] doing is walking I'm guiding her through [02:10] girl very nice you can do verbal phrase [02:14] Ricky Martin like yes [02:16] oops I messed up there it's not always [02:18] perfect try again [02:23] yes yes yes yes so you can see she's [02:29] already starting to understand the [02:31] concept now the end goal is to be able [02:33] to tell my dog leave and I walk and she [02:36] just starts eating and out of my legs of [02:38] course that's gonna take a little bit of [02:40] practice I'm gonna have to do a lot of [02:41] reps with her to get her to understand [02:43] it to understand just like everything [02:49] else I want to say the verbal so I'm [02:52] gonna tell her we then I want to show [02:55] her the cue me you we we you or we could [03:00] just say one leap and the very beginning [03:02] you have our dog follow us through the [03:05] entire pattern whatever is easier for [03:08] you and your dog tricks are meant to be [03:10] fun so this should be a fun exercise [03:12] that you do with your dog also something [03:14] really cute and nice to show your [03:16] friends and show off your friend we we [03:20] we you we you we cute okay so this is [03:27] going to be the first step in teaching [03:29] your dog this weave exercise like I said [03:31] it's really simple as she gets better [03:33] with it my physical you know guiding her [03:36] with my hand is going to become less and [03:38] less but remember the most important [03:41] thing is making sure you stay in your [03:42] verbal before the physical because if [03:46] the verbal is paired with the physical [03:48] the physical will override the verbal [03:50] and become you like you for the behavior [03:52] so if you want your dog to know that [03:54] verbal command make sure you say the [03:56] verbal commands before you start to show [03:58] the dog to physical once now pronounce [04:01] our Lea and get them to do the weave [04:04] when I stay stationary [04:06] again now we have Charlie make sure your [04:09] dogs are conditioned to the markers if [04:11] your dogs are not conditioned to the [04:12] markers yet check out this video it'll [04:15] show you exactly what you need to do in [04:17] order to give them condition to the [04:18] market you have to give them the primary [04:22] reinforcer Charlie [04:23] which toy reflection or the conditioned [04:26] reinforcer the markers sound so for me [04:29] guessing free this is where some people [04:31] will use a clicker too painful in a [04:33] moment in time when our dog does it [04:35] correctly if we can not get the food to [04:37] them within a second so that kind of [04:39] helps us out so if I told Charlie are [04:41] you drunk [04:42] sit yes so the moment he jumped up Peter [04:46] the moment Frankie his buddy to ground I [04:49] say the marker he knows he's going to [04:51] get a reward so let's get Charlie over [04:53] here that's one of the first steps I'm [05:05] going to have to give him some space [05:06] it's going to help me guide him around [05:16] standing still so just like when we were [05:20] training Arie we want to say we in a [05:35] figure eight with REO is a little [05:37] different cuz we're walking now you can [05:39] teach your dog both of these but I like [05:41] to do one or the other just to make it a [05:42] little easier on my dog I was gonna do [05:46] it one more time you have a plane go [05:48] home red he's not perfect yet I haven't [05:53] taught this to either of them but [05:57] I've done the training core where I've [05:59] taught them how to follow my hand when [06:01] it has food telling them to the markers [06:03] and so we can take those and instantly [06:06] incorporate it into each new exercise [06:13] yes yes yes yes good boy buddy [06:22] yes yes yes yes good job okay so that's [06:32] going to be the first step in teaching [06:34] our dog the week make sure you're taught [06:37] to condition that marker make sure that [06:39] your dog understands the concept of [06:41] worry and power-steering again you can [06:44] check that out in this video and then [06:46] you also want to make sure that when [06:48] you're doing this you make it as fun as [06:49] possible tricks are supposed to be fun [06:51] it's a good way to throw that into the [06:53] more formal just to kind of loosen it up [06:57] and make your dogs enjoy it the more [06:59] they enjoy it [07:00] the better they're gonna be at it the [07:01] faster they're going to learn and the [07:03] more fun you're gonna have with your dog [07:04] I hope you guys enjoyed

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 429/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we're going to be [00:01] teaching our dogs to retrieve now this [00:03] isn't a retrieve when you're playing [00:04] fetch and your dog brings back the [00:05] tennis ball but rather retrieve where no [00:08] matter what you drop whether it's your [00:09] keys or your wallet or your phone your [00:12] dog will pick it up and hand it back to [00:13] you this is an important exercise for [00:26] most service dogs as most service dogs [00:28] need to know how to retrieve for their [00:30] owner this is going to be the exact same [00:32] technique that I used in the show on [00:34] Animal Planet rescue dog - Superdog the [00:37] first thing I want to do is I'm using a [00:38] very basic item you can see it's a [00:40] simple wooden pole some people would use [00:42] a PVC pipe but what I want to do is I [00:44] want to be able to bring it out and get [00:46] her to bite it now I'm not asking her to [00:48] hold it just yet I just want her to bite [00:50] it the moment she bites it I'm going to [00:52] use her terminal marker and then I'm [00:54] going to reward her again this is the [00:57] early stages so we're going to reward [00:58] every single one we want her to build [01:01] upon success okay so I had ever seen in [01:05] front of me I like to use a clown bed [01:06] but some people would also use a back [01:08] tie and have the dog attached to a [01:10] harness so what I'm gonna do is I'm [01:12] gonna have her in front of me and I've [01:13] done this exercise with her so at first [01:15] you might have to make it very playful [01:17] to get your dog to do the behavior but [01:19] remember with everything that we do [01:20] first we get the dog to do the behavior [01:22] no matter what we need to do to get them [01:24] to do it so I have it behind my back not [01:27] saying any commands I'm just gonna bring [01:29] it out free once she puts on her Mouse [01:32] on it I mark and reward and then I put [01:33] it back behind my back good breathe good [01:46] girl hardly free very nice notice I'm [01:51] changing the position free cuz I want [01:54] her to know that she has to reach for it [01:55] in order to get that reward free good [01:58] girl and like I said this is a very [02:00] difficult exercise to do so you have to [02:03] be patient with free okay now that I [02:09] have her do any Mac and it's going [02:11] really nicely then [02:12] next thing I want to get her to do is I [02:14] want to get her to hold it so what I'm [02:15] going to do is I'm gonna bring it out [02:17] once she puts her mouth on it I'm gonna [02:19] start petting her and rewarding her now [02:21] when I first do this I kind of have to [02:23] pet on the top and the bottom to keep [02:26] their mouths closed on the item your dog [02:28] is going to want to drop it the first [02:30] time you do this so again I'm gonna [02:32] bring it out and then I'm gonna pet her [02:35] just like this I want her to hold it [02:36] nice and calmly in her mouth you could [02:39] bring a little closer so they can see [02:41] and you can see all I'm doing is I'm [02:43] petting her on the bottom [02:46] and I'm petting her on top then I grab [02:49] it free and I reward her I'm not using [02:52] an out command I want her to know that [02:54] I'm marking the behavior of holding it [02:56] not the behavior of releasing it that's [02:59] why I'm not doing this out because I [03:03] want her to know it's holding it that [03:05] she's getting the reward so that's why [03:07] I'm using the terminal marker again I [03:09] bring it out and I have her hold it now [03:10] your dog's probably going to drop it [03:13] when you first do this if they drop it [03:15] no big deal you're going to use your non [03:17] reinforcement markers so for me it's the [03:20] word wrong so she did it incorrectly I [03:22] would say wrong then I would pick it up [03:24] and I would help her grab it again and I [03:26] would reward her wrong means in the [03:30] language that I'm using with Harley as [03:32] she did it incorrectly and she's not [03:33] going to receive a reward but it doesn't [03:35] mean she's going to get a correction [03:37] once I get the dog comfortable with [03:40] holding it in their mouth and I can [03:41] happily do it for an extended period of [03:43] time [03:44] then I want to get them and start [03:46] walking around while holding the item [03:48] again this is very difficult in the [03:50] beginning so be patient so we're gonna [03:52] start walking around so I would use the [03:54] leash pressure and I simply guide her [03:56] and I get her to walk towards me come [03:57] here baby [03:58] good girl and again if your dog drops it [04:04] no big deal say the wrong or the non [04:07] reinforcement marker number sweetie good [04:10] girl [04:10] good and then bring it back and helpful [04:13] free very nice [04:17] so I would have to walk in a lot of [04:20] different locations this is also a good [04:21] exercise for service dogs because you [04:24] want them to be able to carry things for [04:26] their human with the disability so she [04:28] dropped it so I would say wrong I pick [04:31] it back up I put it back in her mouth [04:32] good girl come here sweetie [04:33] very nice and like I said a lot of dogs [04:36] are gonna drop it at this point Harley [04:38] come here baby good Harley Clark so now [04:48] you can see she's able to walk around [04:49] with it she made a mistake she dropped [04:51] it not a big deal again you have to be [04:53] very patient with this no Harley climb I [04:56] did not see the break in fact break good [05:02] it's a little warm so I'll let her jump [05:04] down so again we want to be very patient [05:06] with this now the next portion after [05:09] I've completed those steps what I want [05:11] to do next is I'm gonna drop the item [05:13] actually I'm going to bring the item to [05:16] the ground but I'm gonna keep my hand [05:18] next to the item when you first do this [05:21] your dog wants to see your hand free [05:23] next to the item for some reason with [05:27] every dog I've trained to retrieve if I [05:29] just drop it they look at it and they go [05:31] your hands and out there so I'm not [05:33] gonna pick it up it's kind of weird so [05:35] the first time I do that what I'm going [05:37] to do is I'm gonna bring it to the [05:38] ground free good girl and have her grab [05:42] it while my hand is still holding it [05:44] free very nice breathe good curls that [05:50] she's doing very well great had [05:55] excellent good job Harley did you want [05:57] the treat are you gonna smell the grass [05:58] so you can see how I'm gonna do that for [06:01] a while and again a lot of reps you have [06:03] to do a lot of repetition in order to [06:05] get the dog to understand this exercise [06:07] then what I do is I slowly start to move [06:10] my hand away from the item as I set it [06:13] down to make the picture look similar [06:15] but to get the dog to pick it up off the [06:17] ground without my hand holding it so [06:19] should look something like this three [06:23] very good Harley [06:28] pretty nice job [06:33] free very good so you can see what I'm [06:37] doing now is I'm starting to move my [06:39] hands slowly out of that picture and [06:41] getting her used to the idea that she [06:44] can pick it up off the ground and hand [06:46] it to me next thing that I do in order [06:49] to build upon this is I start to throw [06:51] it when I first start to throw the item [06:54] I let the dog go retrieve the item while [06:58] it's still moving so we're going to be [07:00] using a little bit of play we want to [07:01] make this fun so I'm gonna guide her in [07:03] a heel position and then what I'm gonna [07:06] do is I'm simply gonna take the item and [07:10] I'm gonna toss it and allow her to go [07:12] get it if she doesn't just take a break [07:15] you lay down getting tired alright so [07:19] we're gonna kick it and then hum I [07:20] doesn't good girl very good that's a [07:25] breeze I wanted to break it to my hand [07:27] free so sometimes what I'll do is I'll [07:29] do this motion like I'm trying to grab [07:31] it but the dogs too far so they have to [07:34] bring it to my hand so again I'm gonna [07:36] bring her back in the heel you're doing [07:38] a nice Harley and I'm gonna take it and [07:40] run click girl very nice oh she's [07:47] getting a little lazy now if they drop [07:49] it like that again don't worry about it [07:51] too much just read toss it and if they [07:53] look again [07:55] good girl free they're gonna need a [07:59] little bit of help in the beginning in [08:01] order to make this successful so that's [08:03] going to be the next step once we do all [08:06] of that we go back to the beginning and [08:08] we start adding a command because now we [08:11] can do all the steps and we know we're [08:13] successful at it so what I'm gonna do [08:15] now is I'm gonna bring the item back [08:17] behind my back I'm gonna go through the [08:19] steps but I'm gonna use the command I [08:21] like to use the word free you can use [08:24] whatever command you like so I have her [08:26] in front of me and I say bring it then I [08:29] bring out free and reward so you can see [08:31] I'm doing exactly what I did before but [08:33] I'm just telling her what I'm about to [08:35] do before I do it [08:36] so again bring free good girl [08:41] bring free that one she didn't fight it [08:45] all the way but that's okay bring free [08:47] good excellent bring free good girl [08:53] she's gotta work a little bit for it [08:55] bring free very nice hardly now I'm [09:00] gonna do where I ever hold bring good [09:03] girl [09:04] free change the length in which you have [09:07] them hold the item to bring very good [09:12] free so I might make it short like this [09:15] bring god free or I can make it a little [09:20] bit longer bring good let go a little [09:26] bit again let go very nice free very [09:31] good so we have that now we're gonna go [09:35] back to the other step where we have [09:37] them walk with it so you see we're [09:39] repeating everything and we're building [09:40] the dogs confidence through successful [09:42] bring very good good come on you can [09:50] bring it to me oh she dropped it early [09:53] so I'm gonna help her pick it back up [09:54] good girl [09:55] free very nice I want her to be [09:58] successful in making sure she hands it [10:00] to me because a dog that retrieves is [10:03] not going to help a lot if they drop it [10:05] right before you grab then what we're [10:08] gonna do is we're going to say it now [10:09] we're going to show the pictures if it's [10:10] on the ground bring want her to grab it [10:15] those there we go [10:16] free good girl bring good free very good [10:24] honey bring [10:26] good girl freeze now when you're doing [10:30] this I do recommend doing it on a flat [10:34] surface without a bunch of distractions [10:36] so this has grass and other things to [10:38] distract them so it's a little more [10:39] difficult you can do it inside somewhere [10:41] with less distractions it's going to [10:42] make it easier and now we go back to [10:44] where we're throwing it so again I'm [10:47] going to say it before I drove right now [10:49] cuz I'm trying to make it more fun bring [10:52] another razor good got a brake to the [10:58] handle right here [10:59] there's my so you see how she kind of [11:01] reached up in order to hand it to me [11:03] okay so once I get that then my next [11:06] step is while I'm doing normal obedient [11:09] so I'm hanging out with her we're [11:10] training down three doing some basic [11:14] obedience and then I drop the item free [11:17] I don't I don't tell her to bring at [11:20] that point because this is another [11:22] exercise where I want her to be able to [11:24] pick it up and bring it back to me free [11:27] even if I don't realize I dropped it so [11:30] if you accidentally drop something your [11:32] dog sees it picks it up and brings it [11:35] back to you and you can reward so this [11:38] right here is going to be the first few [11:39] steps that we're going to do to teach [11:42] the retriever this takes a while so give [11:45] yourself a month two months three months [11:47] if you need to don't rush it be very [11:50] patient with it the next video is going [11:52] to be on how we're going to take this [11:54] and turn it into all these other [11:57] different items that the dog will be [11:59] retrieving because right now she just [12:00] knows to pick this up but I want her to [12:02] know that she needs to pick up keys and [12:04] those different things as well okay so I [12:06] hope you guys liked today's video

The more motivated your dog is, the faster they will perform the behavior. This is why when we play fetch with our dogs, they run very quickly to get the toy.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 432/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we're going to be teach [00:01] our dogs how to speed up their commands [00:03] [Music] [00:13] now speed is based on motivation the [00:16] more motivated our dogs are the faster [00:19] they're going to perform the behavior [00:20] maura dogs could be motivated to access [00:22] something pleasant or they can be [00:24] motivated to prevent something [00:25] unpleasant we can also increase our [00:27] dog's speed through frustration one of [00:30] the things that I like to do in the very [00:32] beginning if you guys have watched some [00:33] of my other videos where you're starting [00:35] to understand how I train is before I [00:37] name a command I want to make sure I can [00:39] get the dog to perform the behavior [00:41] exactly the way that I like using a [00:44] physical cue I used to tell my students [00:47] don't name a command until you love it [00:48] meaning your dog is performing that [00:51] command exactly the way you would like [00:53] them to and this includes our dog speed [00:55] so if I take our year for example and [00:58] I'm working with her on the down command [01:01] so I'm bringing my aunt down she's [01:03] laying down I give her the food she goes [01:05] into her sit I can mark that and I can [01:07] reward her I want to stand so I'm doing [01:09] all these different cues to get her to [01:11] perform these behaviors right now I [01:14] still wouldn't name it even though I can [01:16] get her to lay down maybe it's not as [01:19] fast as I like or maybe there's not as [01:21] much energy as I like one of the things [01:23] you can do is you can use your terminal [01:25] marker more in order to increase our [01:26] dog's speed because remember the [01:28] terminal marker lets the dog know that [01:30] they are correct they are done with the [01:32] behavior and they can jump up and get [01:34] the reward this teaches them the faster [01:36] they do it the faster they get their [01:38] treat and they get to have more fun so [01:40] that helps with it but another thing [01:42] that I've learned is our dogs will often [01:45] match our own speed so what I like to do [01:48] for the down for example when I'm first [01:49] teaching it I'm bringing my hand down [01:51] getting the dog into position but when [01:53] I'm ready to increase the dog speed what [01:55] I do is I drop my hand down very quickly [01:57] and I use my body language to help [01:59] encourage the speed of my dog so it [02:01] looks something like this [02:03] so you can see right there she dropped [02:05] to match the speed of my hand going down [02:08] into that position so again so you can [02:11] see how quickly she's moving once I get [02:14] it to where my dog is performing it at [02:17] the speed that I like then I'm gonna [02:19] start naming the command and our dogs [02:21] are creatures of habit but it takes [02:23] anywhere from my experience up to six to [02:27] nine months to really ingrain a habit in [02:29] our dog's so you have to be patient [02:31] now what I was explaining before is what [02:35] the commands by using our terminal [02:36] markers so if I was doing a sit I want [02:39] my dog to sit very quickly I can do a [02:40] bunch of sits in a row and use the [02:43] terminal marker each time to increase [02:45] that speed so it would look something [02:46] like this [02:47] three three very good breathe very nice [02:58] breathe very good that one a little bit [03:01] all right same thing with my spin if I [03:04] use my terminal marker right away my dog [03:07] gets the reward of an completion they're [03:09] gonna be faster three good so you see [03:13] right there how she's dropping now a lot [03:15] of dogs will actually do that when you [03:17] do this kind of motion watch the [03:18] difference oh she's got a train to drop [03:21] very quickly but again this will help [03:25] get that really nice fast down now same [03:28] thing with our come one called [03:30] alright con if we build distance the [03:33] more distance we can build from our dogs [03:36] the faster they're going to move so what [03:39] I like to do with an exercise for [03:40] speeding up my dogs recall there's a [03:42] couple one is using frustration so I'm [03:45] gonna get a training partner to hold her [03:48] with a harness and I'm gonna run away [03:52] calling her get very excited and then [03:56] once I see enough excitement my training [03:58] partner will release her and she'll come [04:00] running to me very quickly that's [04:02] another thing that you can do is you [04:05] call your dog towards you the moment [04:07] your dog makes the decision to come in [04:10] your direction you use your terminal [04:12] marker and you throw their favorite toy [04:14] behind you so if you guys [04:17] were in the position of my dog I'm [04:19] standing I said come and you made the [04:21] decision to start moving towards me I [04:23] would say free and then I would take my [04:25] toy near the throat between my legs or [04:27] behind my back so the dog would run past [04:29] me to get the toy that's going to [04:31] increase my dog speed so I'm going to [04:34] demonstrate that real quick with the toy [04:36] and then we're gonna bring Harley out [04:38] and I'm gonna show you a technique that [04:40] I use to increase my dog speed when it [04:43] comes to doing something like retrieval [04:44] training all right now I have Ari's toy [04:47] this is one of her favorite toys she [04:49] knows that I have it you can see she's [04:51] ready to jump up and come to me to get [04:54] the toy and I'm gonna use that [04:56] motivation in order to increase her [04:58] speed so I'm gonna get a little bit of [05:00] distance she knows I have the toy and [05:03] when we're working with our dogs this is [05:06] another good point a lot of people say [05:07] do we always have to reward our dogs [05:09] when we're training no but your dog does [05:11] have to believe there's the possibility [05:13] that they are going to get a reward and [05:15] we can use a concept known as free [05:17] shaping I talked about this in one of my [05:19] other videos but what we're doing is [05:21] were teaching the dog that if they do [05:22] something there's always that [05:23] possibility that they might get a reward [05:26] but right now I'm using the reward as a [05:28] way to increase that motivation because [05:31] she knows that it's very accessible at [05:33] this point so I get the distance again [05:36] I'm gonna call her towards me once she [05:38] starts running towards towards me I'm [05:39] using my tunnel marker and then I'm [05:41] gonna throw the toy behind me so we're [05:43] gonna aim the camera at her so you can [05:45] see her go free good girl so you see by [05:51] throwing it behind me that can turn [05:54] thinking that there's going to be that [05:55] possibility of a toy and she's gonna [05:58] have to run to get it so that going to [06:01] speed now we don't want to do that all [06:02] the time re out because what will end up [06:06] happening is you'll call your dog to you [06:08] and your dog will just run for a toy [06:09] that's not their center [06:12] good all right let's get hardly now we [06:16] have Harley and I haven't been too [06:18] worried about speed with her because you [06:20] really don't need a service dog to move [06:23] super fast however the same techniques [06:26] that I was using a hearty will also work [06:28] on Harley here so watch as I drop down [06:31] you see how she matches that movement [06:36] except for right there she did not but [06:38] again it's not always perfect good girl [06:42] very nice since I'm not putting a name [06:45] to a command I don't have to worry about [06:47] using the terminal marker and another [06:51] thing remember when we do a behavior if [06:53] we're rewarding the dog we have to get [06:55] either the primary to them within a [06:57] second of them completing the behavior [06:59] or the conditioned reinforcer so right [07:01] now she's getting the primary the moment [07:04] she gets in the position so she's making [07:06] the connection even though I'm not using [07:08] the marker right now but I could use the [07:10] marker as well I could go yes very good [07:14] yes excellent [07:16] bring her same thing with the sick freak [07:24] very nice good girl good nice job Harley [07:31] this way good now we're going to be [07:38] doing a training session with Harley [07:41] with the intentions of increasing her [07:43] speed using the technique of presenting [07:47] the physical cue with a little bit more [07:49] energy than maybe we would do in the [07:51] very beginning when we're first teaching [07:53] the behavior so let's go ahead jump into [07:56] the training session now again the only [07:58] intention of this session that I'm doing [08:00] with her is to try to increase her speed [08:02] she's not the fastest dog when it comes [08:05] to performing tasks but she's usually [08:07] pretty happy and she has a good attitude [08:10] so that's a good thing keep that in mind [08:12] there's going to be limitations on your [08:14] dog speed a lot of times that's going to [08:17] be paid based on the dog's genetics and [08:19] specific breeds tend to perform [08:21] behaviors more quickly when you see a [08:24] lot of dogs [08:25] and competition obedience or even on [08:28] YouTube where they're doing them very [08:29] quickly a lot of times it's a Malinois [08:32] or a Dutch Shepherd German Shepherds [08:35] tend to be pretty good as well lads they [08:37] have very high food drive so you can use [08:40] that food drive to increase their speed [08:42] and other breeds may not be able to [08:45] perform as quickly so just keep in mind [08:48] your own dog's limitations when it comes [08:51] to trying to increase their speed again [08:53] be aware of what your dog is capable of [08:55] and don't push them beyond their own [08:57] limitations so let's go ahead and jump [08:59] right in heel right there I called her [09:06] in the heel you can see I helped her to [09:08] get her into that position without [09:10] creating any confusion we're just [09:13] starting the session so I want to help [09:14] her out a little bit good job three okay [09:30] right there I threw the item just like I [09:32] said before trying to build a little bit [09:34] of frustration she knows I'm gonna hold [09:36] her back I've done this a few times [09:38] so she's not really resisting she's [09:40] waiting until I sent her to go get the [09:42] item but usually by creating a little [09:44] bit of frustration they'll get the item [09:46] more quickly another thing that I like [09:48] to do is I'll run for the wooden dowel [09:50] and try to get it before the dog does so [09:52] they almost feel like they're in a race [09:54] I'm not doing that in this session but [09:56] that is another technique that I would [09:57] use and if you also notice I'm guiding [10:00] her back in the heel position when it [10:02] comes to finalizing a retrieve it's good [10:05] to teach a dog what position you want [10:07] them to be in when you're going to take [10:09] the item in this case I want her to be [10:11] in the heel position a lot of people [10:13] will have the dog come into a sit front [10:15] depending on if you're doing a specific [10:17] sport that's going to vary but with the [10:19] service dog you can decide where you [10:21] want the dog to be when you take the [10:23] item from them so with her I'm starting [10:25] to develop that position of being in [10:28] heel when I take the item away from her [10:30] so I want that to be her default good [10:34] climb [10:39] come free okay right there I did what I [10:43] said earlier but instead of using a toy [10:45] I'm using food I told her to come the [10:48] moment she made the decision I used my [10:50] terminal marker releasing her from the [10:53] exercise and then moving back a little [10:55] quickly with my food to use that concept [10:57] of chasing as well as rewarding her from [11:00] doing the behavior I just asked her to [11:01] perform Oh spin Yeah right there you saw [11:08] a little bit of puppy ad D that's going [11:11] to happen when you have a young pup [11:12] they're not always going to be as [11:14] focused as an older dog will and a lot [11:16] of that focus will develop over time so [11:18] if you are working with a young puppy [11:20] don't get discouraged if they lose focus [11:22] every now and then sit even right there [11:30] I asked her to sit she was a little bit [11:32] confused I helped her with the luring [11:34] when you're doing a lot of different [11:36] behaviors sometimes the dog may have a [11:38] lot of things on their mind so we like [11:40] to help them out again so they can build [11:42] on success down streak good break down [11:49] free good girl [11:53] sit down great and you can see I'm using [11:58] the technique that we used on our V [12:00] earlier in the video where we drop down [12:02] very quickly encouraging the dog to drop [12:05] just as fast or to match the speed of [12:07] her hand going into that down position [12:09] which in the end will increase our dog [12:11] speed right go ahead climb sit free very [12:18] nice Center [12:23] lots of verbal praise and you are [12:26] probably also noticing that I'm using [12:28] the terminal marker a lot in this [12:30] training session remember what I said [12:32] earlier speed is based on motivation by [12:34] using the terminal marker the dog learns [12:36] the faster they perform the behavior the [12:38] faster they get to jump up and get the [12:40] reward so they tend to do it a little [12:41] bit more quickly [12:49] good keel good climb yes right here I [13:09] want her engagement I want her to see [13:11] what I'm about to do I'm making it very [13:13] obvious that I'm about to throw the [13:15] wooden dowel but I'm going to say the [13:17] command before I throw it in this case [13:20] we're still trying to build that [13:21] motivation and the drive to do this [13:24] behavior quickly when it comes to the [13:27] final product what you want to be able [13:28] to do is throw the item have it stopped [13:31] moving then tell the dog to bring they [13:33] go retrieve the item bring it back into [13:35] the position that you want for me it's [13:37] going to be the heel command at least [13:39] for Harley and that's going to be the [13:42] final picture but right now since we're [13:45] still trying to build that motivation to [13:47] do the behavior quickly I'm gonna say [13:49] the command and then throw it and allow [13:51] her to go get it while it's still moving [13:52] free now right there I made a common [14:04] mistake that a lot of trainers will make [14:06] I stepped into her heel position and [14:09] when we do that then what we're doing is [14:13] we're telling the dog we're going to [14:14] adjust for them instead of having them [14:16] adjust for us or our position what I [14:19] should have done was I should have [14:21] stepped forward repositioned her and [14:24] then got her to find the correct heel [14:26] position instead of me placing myself [14:28] into her heel position I did that mostly [14:32] because of the fact that I don't want [14:33] her dropping the wooden dowel right now [14:35] I want her to build on that success [14:38] however that is something you want to [14:40] keep in mind if you want your dog to be [14:41] able to find that perfect heel position [14:43] free very nice and I told her free she [14:49] dropped it before I was able to grab it [14:51] that's my fault because I said free and [14:53] she did what she was supposed to which [14:55] is she completed the behavior she [14:57] released it and I rewarded her so then I [14:59] had to pick up the wooden dowel I could [15:01] have also asked her to pick it up after [15:03] I dropped it again but either way it's [15:05] going to be fine as long as they drop it [15:08] after you use the terminal marker or [15:10] after you tell them the release word [15:12] which for Harley is the word out [15:26] [Music] [15:33] excellent [15:34] down down how'd you chew it up good girl [15:49] great spin free so what I did right [15:57] there that's a little training tool that [16:00] I like to call chasing when the dog [16:03] starts to go after the food reward when [16:05] you release something you make a game by [16:07] having them chase it so we are going to [16:09] be incorporating the dog's food drive as [16:13] well as the dog's play Drive and prey [16:16] drive which does help increase the speed [16:18] you don't want to have them chase it too [16:20] much because you did use the terminal [16:22] marker which means they are going to get [16:24] the reward if your dog doesn't enjoy [16:26] chasing then it's going to diminish the [16:29] reward she enjoys it so it adds value to [16:32] it again the science of dog training is [16:34] always going to be the same but what [16:36] varies between each dog is going to be [16:38] their perseverance their motivation [16:40] intelligence so we want to keep those [16:42] things in mind when we're working with [16:43] each individual dog nice job spin good [16:49] girl sir that's my good girl very nice [16:57] very nice Harley I like to use the [17:01] center command quite a bit when I'm [17:03] working on developing a dog's heel as [17:05] well because it's a very easy position [17:08] to keep the dog in and your legs can [17:10] help turn them left and right [17:12] which will help when you're doing more [17:13] advanced obedience and you're teaching [17:15] your dog a left about [17:16] turn or write about turn this really [17:18] does help with the process and it also [17:20] gets the dog used to looking up at you [17:23] which will help develop that focused [17:25] heel in the future if that is something [17:27] that you want to do with your own dog [17:28] down three good come six three sit three [17:40] very good time chasing highly he'll [17:53] bring right there she wanted to play a [17:58] little bit instead of chasing the doll [18:00] you can see how she was trying to engage [18:02] with me but she still went and did the [18:04] behavior which is great that's what I [18:06] wanted her to do but you're going to see [18:08] that as well sometimes your dog may [18:10] rather play with you if that happens do [18:13] not reward them by playing with them [18:15] because then they'll be able to figure [18:16] out how to manipulate the situation they [18:18] won't want to get the wooden doll or [18:20] whatever it is whatever it is that [18:21] you're using to teach the retrieve and [18:23] they'll be able to get you to play by [18:26] engaging with you in that way which that [18:28] can't happen a dog may want to play and [18:30] then instead of doing the obedience you [18:32] go to play and the dog goes okay well [18:33] now I know how to get you to play to get [18:35] out of obedience so make sure they still [18:37] complete the task if you start to notice [18:38] something like that free good girl you [18:51] down free Harley heel down very nice [19:03] climb right here this is solidify in the [19:12] heel position you have probably seen it [19:14] in my other video we find different [19:16] positions we call the dog into heel and [19:18] then we reward them that's a great [19:19] exercise to incorporate in your [19:21] obedience routine heel [19:30] thank the girl very what I did right [19:38] there was I ran away from her [19:40] encouraging her to increase the speed to [19:43] get into the heel position in order to [19:45] complete that behavior if she notices [19:47] I'm moving away from her then she will [19:49] realize that she has to move faster if [19:51] she wants to finish that exercise so [19:54] that's another great strategy to use to [19:56] increase the speed [20:00] no.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 433/468,3 [20:02] nice job Arlie good girl [20:06] Center very good job and you also notice [20:18] with my training sessions I'm [20:20] incorporating a bunch of different [20:22] commands I'm not just doing one command [20:24] over and over and over again this is [20:26] something else that a lot of people have [20:28] been asking they think ok I'm teaching [20:30] this it so I'm just gonna do this it 100 [20:32] times in a row I'm just teaching the [20:33] down so I'm gonna do the down 100 times [20:35] in a row you want to mix it up and make [20:37] it more fun it may take the dog longer [20:39] to learn one specific behavior but in [20:42] the end it's going to be better because [20:43] the training is going to be way more fun [20:45] way more engaging and if your dog enjoys [20:49] the training that means it's going to be [20:51] much easier to teach them new behaviors [20:53] and new commands ah down 3 good Carly [21:01] heel right there she needed some help [21:07] and that's going to happen [21:11] good girl very good good girl [21:17] again guiding her into he'll bring [21:20] helping her my job that I want her to be [21:23] in when she performs a retrieve I'm [21:25] going to make that her default position [21:27] so anytime she retrieves something I [21:29] want her to come to the left side of the [21:31] handler heel [21:36] good down he'll bring nice top so you [21:54] can see she's starting to slow down a [21:56] little bit and that's because of the [21:58] heat outside so I'm starting to [22:00] recognize that she's slowing down [22:02] because it's warm and that's when you [22:04] want to end a session before the dog [22:06] either becomes bored or they become too [22:09] tired you want to end on a high note and [22:11] so since I started I'm starting to [22:13] recognize that she's getting tired I try [22:16] to wrap the training session up to make [22:17] sure I'm ending on a high note so she [22:20] wants to come back and train more in the [22:21] future three nice climb [22:32] come sit Center good girl okay you down [22:48] free come you right there what I was [23:00] doing when I asked her to do the come [23:02] when called she wasn't sitting as close [23:04] to me as I would have liked that's why I [23:06] was backing up and repositioning her [23:09] getting her to the position that I would [23:11] like her to be in when she does the come [23:13] one called yes cue so right there she [23:23] was waiting for me to stop because we [23:25] did a bunch of heels right into a stop [23:27] and then right into the down that can [23:29] happen if you start doing too much [23:31] pattern training and your dog starts to [23:32] recognize it so I started to run forward [23:35] to show her that I was doing the heel [23:37] command and to make it more fun so she [23:39] has to run and get back into the heel [23:41] position in order to get the reward this [23:43] is something I like to do with dogs when [23:45] I'm working that heel command a common [23:47] technique that a lot of people will use [23:49] is they [23:50] jump away from the dog if they're using [23:52] a training collar and a leash and when [23:54] the dog fails to keep up with them [23:56] they'll get a correction I like to do [23:59] this because it makes it more playful it [24:01] makes it more fun and it increases the [24:03] dog's confidence because once I get into [24:05] position they get the reward and they [24:07] see how much more fun it is so that's a [24:09] great way to increase the speed but also [24:11] to get the dog into the heel position [24:13] and maintain it by implementing some fun [24:17] good girl and she didn't get it there [24:30] come free free very good free free very [24:48] good free good right here if you watched [24:57] my retrieval training video randomly [25:00] dropping items I want the dog to be able [25:02] to see that pick the item up and bring [25:05] it back to the handler [25:07] good job free down free down free Frank [25:24] brick so right there I said break [25:27] because I was thinking maybe she thought [25:29] she was in a down stay and she looked at [25:32] the item but she did not go to pick it [25:34] up don't if that happens the biggest [25:38] thing you need to keep in mind is to [25:39] just follow through with the training [25:41] and don't get upset if the dog isn't [25:43] doing it perfectly you're going to have [25:45] days where your dog performs way better [25:48] than they do on other days and for [25:50] whatever reason that is don't stress [25:52] yourself out just finish the session [25:54] help the dog out if they need it win on [25:56] or end on a high note and that's going [25:59] to help the training what happens to a [26:01] lot of people is they become frustrated [26:03] if the dog does it do it [26:04] exactly the way that they want they end [26:06] up getting angry or they over correct [26:09] the dog and that ends up causing more [26:11] problems in the future then if you were [26:14] to just stay calm and relaxed and follow [26:16] through the training session almost as [26:18] if the dog did not make the mistake by [26:20] helping them what I do right here Bri [26:28] good girl good girl good girl [26:47] Bri all done I hope you guys

This is considered one of the most complicated behaviors to teach a dog to perform correctly. It requires many hours of practice, however, if you put the time in, this can quickly become one of your favorite exercises to do with your dog. Here are the ten steps in order: 1) Engagement training/teaching the markers/developing the sit front 2) Developing your dogs focus in the heel position 3) Developing your dogs focus in the center position 4) Teach your dog to walk while maintaining the center position 5) Use power steering to teach your dog how to maintain heel position while walking."

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 437/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] alright everybody in today's video we're [00:01] going to be working on the fundamentals [00:03] to teaching our dogs a focused heel the [00:16] first step that we're going to be doing [00:18] and a lot of these steps you may have [00:19] seen in some of my other videos but we [00:22] want to put them all together in order [00:23] to get that really nice picture of our [00:25] dog walking next to us in the focused [00:27] heel position looking up at our face the [00:30] very first step that we want to do is we [00:31] want to do that engagement training and [00:33] we want to teach our dogs the sit front [00:35] position looking up at our face [00:37] remember the intentions of engagement [00:39] training is to teach our dog the markers [00:41] which is those sounds that predict a [00:43] reward so we can pinpoint a moment in [00:44] time when our dog is right or wrong this [00:46] is very important when we're doing [00:48] focused heel because we want to be able [00:50] to pinpoint the act of the dog looking [00:52] up at our face ok so these little [00:54] details are really going to make a big [00:56] difference so what I'm gonna do is I'm [00:58] gonna take Aria don't bring her into the [00:59] sit front position this is going to be [01:03] the first step in this series and I want [01:06] her looking up in my face now when we [01:09] first teach the markers we're going to [01:13] have our dogs looking at our hand [01:14] because they know that's where the food [01:16] is coming from but we're gonna get it to [01:18] the point where they're looking up at [01:19] our face that's the most important part [01:21] for this step so when we're starting out [01:23] remember we're going to use two markers [01:25] our continuation marker and our terminal [01:27] marker my continuation marker for her is [01:30] yes and her terminal marker is free so [01:37] you see when I'm first teaching it I'm [01:39] keeping my hand next to my face because [01:42] I want to get my dog used to the muscle [01:44] memory of looking up at my face after [01:47] I've done enough of this to get my dog [01:49] condition to the markers then what I [01:51] want to do is I want to get my dog to [01:53] understand it's the act of looking at my [01:55] face that's triggering the release of [01:57] the reward and not the act of looking at [02:00] my hand so I'm gonna take my hand and [02:02] I'm gonna slowly move one hand away from [02:04] my face and I want her to continue [02:06] looking at my face yes and if she does [02:09] it correctly I'm mark and then I deliver [02:11] the reward then I'm going to do the [02:13] other hand [02:13] I bring it out yes as long as she [02:18] continues looking at my face I'm gonna [02:20] mark and reward now what you're gonna [02:22] see brick that's going to happen the [02:24] first time you do this is your dog is [02:26] going to watch the hand because they [02:28] know that's where the food is coming [02:29] from just be patient and wait because [02:32] what's gonna end up happening is they're [02:33] gonna be looking at the food then [02:35] they're gonna look at you [02:36] the moment they look back at you you [02:38] mark that behavior and then you deliver [02:40] the reward and you want to get it to the [02:42] point where you can have food in both [02:43] hands [02:44] and you can bring both hands out to the [02:46] side and your dog will continue looking [02:49] up at your face free then you can use [02:52] your release marker and reward your dog [02:54] this is going to be the very first step [02:57] you want to make sure your dog has a [02:58] very nice sit front position and you [03:01] want to make sure they're good at [03:02] looking up at your face another portion [03:04] of this exercise is getting your dog to [03:07] do what's known as the backwards follow [03:09] exercise this is where we get our dog to [03:12] walk directly in front of us as we walk [03:14] backwards this is going to help with a [03:17] couple things one it's going to teach [03:19] our dog to continue to look up while [03:21] they're walking in order to get the [03:22] reward and it's going to help us teach [03:25] our dogs to do that automatics it when [03:27] halted when we first start we're going [03:29] to give continual reinforcement as we [03:31] walk backwards I'm gonna put a good [03:33] amount of supply in one hand and I'm [03:35] gonna reward with the opposite hand so [03:38] I'm gonna walk backwards just like this [03:40] and I want her to stay nice and close [03:42] and as long as she stays close she's [03:45] gonna continue to get the reward and [03:48] what's really important with this is [03:50] making sure you're rewarding up against [03:52] your body if you want your dog to be [03:54] nice and close to you so don't walk [03:57] backwards like this and reward your dog [03:59] far away make sure they're nice and [04:01] close again getting them used to walking [04:03] and looking up and then when we stop [04:06] sorry when we stop we lift and our dog [04:09] sits down and we reward again so we walk [04:12] backwards stop and lift and then reward [04:16] and then what we want to get to the [04:18] point is where we can walk backwards our [04:21] hands out of sight and our dog will [04:22] follow us in that center position [04:26] exactly the way we just taught it free [04:29] and then we can release and reward good [04:31] girl Larry climb okay step two step two [04:37] we want to start developing our dog's [04:38] focus in the heel position so we're [04:41] gonna take our dog and we're gonna place [04:43] them in the heel position using that [04:45] power steering the same thing I did with [04:47] my dog in the sit front I'm gonna do [04:48] with her in the heel position so first [04:50] thing is I'm gonna hold the food up by [04:53] my face again getting her used to [04:55] looking in this direction yes and then [04:58] I'm gonna reward now for this one I'm [05:00] gonna use the continuation marker [05:01] because I want her to maintain that heel [05:04] position yes and then reward yes reward [05:10] and I'm going to do that enough - she [05:12] understands the concept the nice thing [05:14] about this one is you're only using one [05:16] hand not two so not what I'm going to do [05:18] is I'm going to bring my hand outward [05:19] and I want her to maintain that focus on [05:22] my face now [05:24] yes what you're gonna see is going to [05:26] happen with your dogs is they're going [05:28] to follow your hand the first time re [05:30] we're still doing the exercise so what [05:33] you're gonna see is her dogs gonna [05:34] follow it like that [05:35] and then when they look back at you yes [05:37] then your reward and even though she's [05:40] turning her head to get the reward she [05:43] knows that it's the act of looking at me [05:45] that's triggering that released to get [05:47] the reward or that ability rather for [05:49] her to turn her head since I'm using a [05:51] continuation marker yes and you want to [05:57] get it to the point where you can hold [05:58] your hand next to your dog's face with [06:01] the Treat in there and they look at your [06:04] face and not the reward so yeah she's [06:05] really wanting to look at the reward but [06:07] now she's looking at my face now she's [06:08] at back at the reward yes [06:11] and then I reward her when she's [06:12] maintaining that eye contact that's what [06:15] we're going to watch this is a very [06:16] simple step but it's very important to [06:19] get your dog to understand that concept [06:21] of looking up at your face while in heel [06:23] position now for step three this is what [06:26] I like to teach my dog the center [06:28] position so what I'm going to do is I'm [06:30] going to take re Center I'm gonna have [06:33] her come into the center position now [06:35] the same thing you're gonna see how a [06:37] lot of this there's a lot of repeating [06:39] what we've been do [06:39] just in different positions now I'm [06:41] gonna get her to look up at my face [06:43] while she's in the center position so we [06:47] can start again by holding our hands by [06:48] her face yes and reward using the [06:51] continuation marker so we have our dog [06:53] in the center position and we have them [06:55] looking up at our face same thing we [06:57] want to get to the point where they're [06:58] looking up at our face even while our [06:59] hands are out to the side we don't want [07:01] them turning their head like she just [07:03] did yes and as they do it correct we're [07:06] going to mark and we're going to reward [07:08] yes now we're gonna take our E and this [07:13] is going to be the next step and we're [07:15] gonna walk around with her in the center [07:17] commanded position I really like doing [07:19] this because it does a couple things [07:21] it helps teach our dogs again to walk [07:24] forward to trust us keeping their head [07:26] up which is that desired look that [07:28] people want with they're focused he'll [07:29] get her to trust me and it also helps [07:32] because we have our legs to create a [07:34] barrier on the left and right side and [07:36] we can use that to teach our dogs to [07:38] pivot left pivot right and we can start [07:40] building on those left about turns right [07:42] about turns by teaching our dogs the [07:44] fundamentals while keeping them in the [07:46] center position it's all about that [07:48] muscle memory so when I first started [07:50] teaching my dog to walk from this [07:51] position I'm just gonna walk and [07:52] continue to reward them as long as they [07:54] maintain that position so I'm gonna walk [07:56] and I'm gonna reward getting her used to [07:59] looking up and I'm also holding the food [08:02] up by my face the way I was doing before [08:05] trying not to drop good girl and again [08:12] the concept or the idea is to get her [08:15] used to walking looking up and trusting [08:18] me this is really what I want cuz this [08:20] is going to transfer over into that [08:22] focused heel and have you taught your [08:23] dogs to walk backwards they can walk [08:25] backwards in this position as well which [08:27] is really cool once you can get them [08:32] walking and looking up at you by using [08:34] the food lure to keep their head up then [08:36] what we want to do is we want to [08:38] transition to where we can have them [08:39] walk in the center looking up at our [08:41] face with our hands down to our sides so [08:43] we're gonna walk and we want them to [08:45] continue looking up just like she is if [08:47] you need to put your hand behind your [08:48] back you could do that as well but the [08:50] idea is that your dog is looking up at [08:52] your face and if they're doing it nice [08:53] we three we can use our terminal marker [08:56] take our time and give them the reward [08:58] so this is going to be a very important [09:01] step again to get our dogs used to [09:03] walking looking up trusting us as well [09:07] as re-center getting them used to [09:10] working that automatics it went halted [09:14] for this step what we're going to be [09:16] doing is going back again to getting our [09:18] dogs are you're done searching for stuff [09:20] go climb what we're gonna do on this [09:23] step is get our dog now used to being in [09:26] the heel position looking up and walking [09:29] but before I do that one of the things [09:32] that I like to do is I like to [09:33] transition the dog from the sit front [09:36] position as I'm walking backwards into [09:38] the heel position now when I first do [09:41] this I'm really worried about muscle [09:43] memory I want to get my dog used to the [09:46] physical movements that they're going to [09:47] be doing in focused heel so it's going [09:49] to be a lot of luring basically I'm [09:51] gonna be power steering the dog and [09:52] guiding them exactly where I want when [09:54] you first do this your dog isn't even [09:56] really going to know what it's doing [09:58] it's just gonna be following your [09:59] guidance but that's okay because we're [10:01] working on the dog's muscle memory of [10:03] looking up and walking which is very [10:05] important you're gonna see in the next [10:06] step how we're going to start [10:08] transitioning to where we can get that [10:09] final picture of the focus peel okay so [10:12] I'm gonna take Ari again and I'm gonna [10:15] bring her to this sit front position so [10:17] what I'm going to do is as I'm walking [10:19] backwards I bring my dog to the side I [10:21] turn and then I bring them into a focus [10:24] heel so again when I'm first working a [10:26] dog in focused heel I'm basically [10:28] keeping my hand right where I want my [10:31] dog and I'm rewarding constantly I'm [10:34] giving them constant reward so I'm just [10:37] getting them used to being in this [10:38] position following me around whether [10:40] we're turning or we're pivoting getting [10:44] them comfortable with understanding that [10:46] position and that movement re so that's [10:52] going to be real important for that [10:53] muscle memory and to get them used to [10:55] stopping and sitting I also like to [10:58] teach my dog to walk backwards this way [11:00] bring them back up and again we're just [11:04] using that power steering getting our [11:06] dog comfortable walk [11:07] looking up in the heel position break [11:10] okay now we've done a little bit of [11:12] luring we've done a good amount of that [11:14] power steering getting our dog to [11:16] understand the heel position are you now [11:20] what we're going to do is we're going to [11:21] start getting our dog used to listening [11:23] to our command heel where we step [11:25] forward we want them looking up we want [11:27] that muscle memory and we want to get we [11:30] want to get the dog understanding this [11:32] process so the way that I like to do [11:34] this is you're gonna see all the pieces [11:36] starting to come together now I'm gonna [11:37] bring my hand out to the side I'm gonna [11:39] say the command heelp left foot after I [11:45] say the command I'm going to bring my [11:46] hand up warm my dog take a few steps go [11:49] into the sit then mark and reward and [11:52] I'm gonna do a bunch of these all right [11:55] so it's gonna be a little something like [11:56] this wait so she's looking at me [11:58] heel then I bring the food up I take a [12:01] few steps I sit I mark and reward break [12:04] I bring her back and I'd do it again so [12:07] you see there's a lot of helping in the [12:09] early stages he'll then my hand comes up [12:12] we walk she sits yes mark and reward [12:16] break and she's not getting the reward [12:19] until we finished this movement and I [12:22] also like to change the distance so I [12:23] might go heel I bring my hand up she [12:28] doesn't position yes the way that I like [12:31] I'll reposition her break and get her in [12:33] the position that I want her to be in so [12:39] we're gonna do a good amount of these to [12:41] get our dogs to understand this process [12:43] so again one more time we have our hand [12:45] out to the side we say heel we step with [12:47] our left leg we bring our hand up we get [12:49] our dog to sit yes and then we reward [12:51] brick so it should look something like [12:54] this all right heel [13:04] three so I just used the terminal marker [13:07] on that one instead okay so that's going [13:10] to be that step for this next step what [13:12] we want to do is we want to be able to [13:13] get our dogs now to walk in the heel [13:16] position while looking up at us and not [13:18] using our hand as a guide to be able to [13:21] complete this exercise so you have to do [13:23] a lot of the other steps in order to get [13:25] your dog to this step are you so when we [13:31] do this step are you we don't want to [13:37] have food in our hand we want to have it [13:39] to the side with no food so now they're [13:42] not going to be looking to get that food [13:46] because they know it's not there we're [13:48] gonna say the heel command we're gonna [13:50] step forward with our left leg same way [13:52] we did before but this time we're gonna [13:54] keep our hand on the side we just want [13:56] to get a couple steps if our dog gets [13:58] two or three successful steps without [14:00] looking in any direction but at our face [14:02] we're gonna use our terminal marker and [14:04] then we're going to reward them we want [14:06] to do a good amount of these and we also [14:07] want to change the distance as far as [14:10] how many steps we're going to take each [14:12] time I might take two steps one time I [14:13] might take 15 steps I might take four [14:16] steps but we want to vary it alright so [14:18] we have our dog looking up at us we're [14:19] gonna say heel and that's that free good [14:22] girl [14:24] very nice releasing her from the [14:27] behavior so I only took a couple steps [14:28] right there another trick you can do is [14:31] you can keep the food in your right hand [14:33] and when you release your dog reward [14:35] them from behind your back that'll [14:37] actually keep their head up a little bit [14:38] higher so you'll see her she'll I'll see [14:40] if I can get her do it in this one heel [14:44] three good so you see how she went [14:47] behind me to get the reward I also do [14:49] that with toys because of your dog this [14:51] goes back to reward placement if your [14:53] dog is anticipating release and reward [14:56] behind your body what ends up happening [14:58] is their head goes up higher because [15:00] they're anticipating that release and [15:02] going around your body which will give [15:04] you a really nice looking focus feel are [15:06] you good girl so again we're gonna step [15:10] and do everything we just did he'll then [15:14] step we want that eye contact [15:16] three mark and reward when our dogs in [15:19] that perfect position good girl and I [15:21] could bring her right back into it again [15:23] keep my hand to the side three very nice [15:31] he'll free good very nice this next step [15:40] is to help our dog to understand how to [15:42] pivot in place one of the things that [15:45] you have to do is you have to be able to [15:46] accomplish this as if you're competing [15:48] left and right about turns and now the [15:50] left about turn you're on the same line [15:52] so if you had a straight line you have [15:54] to turn on that line same thing if [15:57] you're doing a right about turn you have [15:59] to turn on that line so we have to get [16:02] our dogs used to being able to make such [16:05] an extreme turn it would be easy if we [16:08] could do something like this a very wide [16:10] turn but they want you to be able to [16:12] turn on the same line so what I like to [16:14] do for this is I'll teach the dogs how [16:16] to work their body with that rear-end [16:18] awareness and movement by doing a spiral [16:21] exercise what we're going to do is we're [16:23] gonna have a large spiral that we're [16:25] going to be following on the ground and [16:27] that spiral is going to get smaller and [16:29] smaller up into the point where we are [16:31] basically having the dog pivot in one [16:34] spot and we're going to do that for our [16:36] left side as well as our right side so [16:39] I'm going to bring her in a heel [16:40] position depending on where you are this [16:42] is very difficult you may have to help [16:44] with a little bit of food during this [16:46] exercise heel so we're going to step and [16:49] we're going to walk in a circle and [16:52] again we're gonna make that circle [16:54] smaller and smaller to the point where [16:57] we're pivoting in one place Bree good [17:03] girl so that was excellent for our going [17:06] left which is going to help our dog with [17:08] our right about turn so I stepped off to [17:10] my left side and the circle going [17:13] clockwise will help our dog with the [17:15] right about turn now we're going to do [17:18] the same thing but we're gonna step off [17:20] to our right and the circle is going to [17:22] be counterclockwise which is going to [17:24] help our dogs with the left about turn [17:26] so it should look something like this [17:28] are you [17:34] good girl he'll step and I'm gonna do [17:38] that wide circle and I'm gonna continue [17:42] to walk around and make that circle [17:45] smaller and smaller free until we're [17:56] pivoting in one spot and that again is [17:59] going to help our dog when we start [18:01] teaching them a left about turn and a [18:03] right about turn so this video covered [18:06] some of the basic fundamentals when it [18:08] comes to teaching our dogs a focused [18:10] feel I hope you

Unfortunately, if you own a dog, there is a possibility that your dog may end up in a dog fight. The important thing is knowing what to do if the situation arises. What most people do in a panic is they try to pull the dogs apart by the scruff around their necks or they try hitting them, hoping that will get them to stop fighting. Grabbing them by the neck is not only dangerous for the human, but if you try to pull them apart that way, you can end up causing more damage to both the dogs. If you try to hit the dogs, hoping that will stop the fight, it may just add fuel to the fire and increase the struggle, since they’ll think it's the other dog causing the additional pain. The best course of action to take is to try and stay calm and target the dog that is being the aggressor. You will then grab the scruff on the dog's lower back, by the base of the tail."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 440/468,"You will then lift the dog up, by that scruff until the dog lets go of the other dog. If the dog doesn't let go of the other dog, then just twist the dog's scruff to make the dog let go. Be cautious, though, because it is possible that some dogs may redirect the aggression on the human. Even though this isn't a perfect solution and anytime dogs get into a fight, there is the possibility of the dogs being injured or the person being bitten. However, if you do it the way I just described, you will have a much higher chance of stopping the fight and coming out of it without an injury to the dogs or yourself. Be sure to check out all the other dog training videos on my channel. You will learn how to train your dog to sit, down, come, heel, stay, and much more.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 441/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:03] nobody gets a dog thinking that one day [00:05] their dog is going to be attacked by [00:07] another dog and the owner of this other [00:09] dog is not going to be able to control [00:11] their dog and it's going to be up to you [00:13] to not only stop the dog fight but do it [00:17] in a way that's going to be safe for [00:19] both dogs in today's video we're gonna [00:23] be discussing how to stop a dog fight if [00:36] you're anything like me and you find [00:38] yourself scrolling through your social [00:40] media news feeds and you have a bunch of [00:42] crazy dog friends maybe similar to [00:44] yourself then you're gonna see a lot of [00:47] photos and videos of cute dogs and [00:49] puppies that your friends share but [00:51] every now and then you may come across a [00:53] video of a dog being attacked by another [00:55] dog and in these videos none of the [00:58] humans know how to stop these two dogs [01:00] from fighting I hate seeing videos like [01:02] this because not only do I feel bad for [01:04] the dog being attacked in the video but [01:06] I also feel bad for the humans that do [01:09] not know how to stop it from happening [01:10] and they're sitting there watching their [01:12] beloved pet being injured by another dog [01:15] in these videos you will often see the [01:17] humans trying very similar techniques [01:19] without success the first most common [01:22] technique that I see is a human will [01:24] start kicking screaming yelling at the [01:26] dog that is attacking their dog often [01:29] this doesn't work and the reason is [01:31] because the dog that is now being hit is [01:33] going to think that that new pain is [01:35] coming from the dog that they are [01:36] attacking and their aggression will [01:38] become even worse another common [01:40] strategy that you'll see in these videos [01:42] is they will try to separate the dogs by [01:45] grabbing the next scruff on each dog and [01:47] pulling them apart now on occasions they [01:50] will be able to separate the two dogs [01:52] but not without consequences dogs that [01:55] are fighting will often target the neck [01:56] so when you grab the neck scruff and you [01:59] try to pull them apart they may think [02:01] it's the other dog doing that so they [02:03] will begin to bite even harder and as [02:05] you pull them apart you're going to [02:07] create a bunch of damage as a two dogs [02:10] biting are now having their canines [02:12] ripping through the other dog's skin so [02:15] this is not a technique that I would [02:16] wreck [02:17] using the last common strategy you'll [02:19] see in these videos is they will try to [02:21] attempt to separate the dogs by using a [02:23] metal bar in order to pry the dog's [02:26] mouth open now this can work but you're [02:29] probably going to create some damage [02:30] while doing this if you're trying to pry [02:33] a dog's mouth open and they're trying to [02:34] bite down and you're using a metal bar [02:36] you can really damage the dog's canines [02:38] now you may be thinking who cares about [02:41] their canines I'm trying to separate the [02:43] fight and that's understandable but [02:45] there are techniques where you can [02:46] separate them much faster without [02:49] creating this additional damage and [02:50] that's what we're going to discuss next [02:52] professionals in the canine industry [02:55] understand that there is a possibility [02:57] that they may find themselves in a [02:59] situation with two dogs fighting and [03:01] they're going to have to know how to [03:03] separate these two dogs the first most [03:05] common practice amongst professionals is [03:07] going to be the hind leg approach this [03:10] is something that volunteers and [03:12] employees of shelters and rescues are [03:14] often trained to perform what they will [03:16] do is they will target the dog that is [03:17] being the aggressor they will grab that [03:19] dog's hind legs they will lift up and [03:22] back away usually this will get the dog [03:24] to release the dog that they are biting [03:26] they will also have somebody else [03:28] holding the dog that is being bitten [03:30] because once you get the two dogs [03:32] separated the one that was being [03:34] attacked will often think that you are [03:35] now teaming up with them in order to get [03:38] the other dog and they will try to [03:39] re-engage with the dog that you just [03:41] pulled off of them this technique does [03:43] work but if you are going to use this [03:45] technique be careful that you do not [03:47] damage the hind legs of the dog that you [03:50] are lifting up they are trying to [03:51] separate from the dog that they are [03:53] fighting the next technique is the choke [03:55] out technique they will target the dog [03:57] that is being the aggressor they will [03:59] grab that dog's collar and they will [04:00] lift up attempting to choke the dog off [04:04] of the bite in this situation they will [04:06] also have somebody holding the dog that [04:08] is being attacked because just like in [04:10] the previous situation once you get the [04:13] two dogs separated they will try to [04:15] fight again so it is going to be your [04:17] responsibility to prevent that from [04:19] happening [04:19] if the choking is not working what they [04:22] will do next is they will twist the [04:23] collar attempting to make it tighter and [04:26] getting the dog to release the dog in [04:28] order to have that pressure turn [04:30] I have been a professional dog trainer [04:31] since 2012 and in those eight years I [04:35] have been in a few situations where I [04:37] had to separate a dogs kerfuffle the [04:40] technique that I'm about to explain is [04:42] my number one go-to technique and it [04:44] always gets me the results that I need [04:46] without causing any sort of damage to [04:48] the two dogs that are in a fight what [04:50] you want to do is you're going to target [04:52] the dog that is being the aggressor and [04:53] you're going to grab the scruff on the [04:56] lower back right next to the base of the [04:59] tail you grab that scruff and you lift [05:01] up it's almost guaranteed that the dog [05:04] is going to let go of the dog they are [05:05] fighting just like in the other [05:07] situations you have to make sure once [05:09] you get the two dogs separated that you [05:11] do not give them an opportunity to [05:13] reengage if the dog does not let go when [05:16] you pick them up using the scruff your [05:18] next option is to twist when you twist [05:21] that will usually get the more stubborn [05:24] dogs to let go [05:25] but this is something you have to keep [05:27] in mind anytime you are dealing with a [05:30] dog fight there is a possibility that [05:32] you can be bit during the conflict every [05:35] single time I've used this technique the [05:37] dog has let go of the other dog but they [05:40] almost always turn around and redirect [05:43] that energy towards me I've had dogs [05:45] mouth my arm without applying any sort [05:48] of pressure because maybe they thought I [05:50] was another dog attacking them and once [05:53] they realized I was human they chose not [05:55] to bite I've had dogs turn in look and [05:58] again once they realized I was not [06:00] another dog they made the decision not [06:02] to bite me but just keep in mind any one [06:05] of these techniques there's always the [06:07] possibility that you can receive a bite [06:10] during the confrontation nobody wants to [06:12] find themselves in a situation where [06:14] they have to stop two dogs from fighting [06:16] but if you find yourself in that [06:18] situation it will help a great deal to [06:22] have this knowledge and to understand [06:24] these techniques last but not least if [06:27] you do find yourself having to separate [06:29] two dog fights try your best to stay [06:31] calm [06:31] find the dog that is being the aggressor [06:33] make sure somebody else can hold the dog [06:36] that is being attacked and use one of [06:38] the three proven techniques to separate [06:40] the two dogs with the least amount of [06:42] damage [06:43]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 444/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we're gonna be going [00:02] over the left about turn and the right [00:03] about turn we talked about it a little [00:15] bit in my last video but we're gonna [00:17] focus primarily on that there are a few [00:20] steps that you want to do before doing [00:22] this exercise this is directed more [00:24] towards competition obedience but it is [00:27] going to help if you're just taking your [00:28] dog out on many walks it'll keep your [00:30] dog a little bit more focused on you and [00:32] it's gonna help if you do want to change [00:34] direction for whatever reason it [00:36] definitely helps with that engagement so [00:38] again we're gonna be doing the left [00:39] about turn and the right about turn re [00:41] so if I bring hard re right here in the [00:44] heel position and I turn you see how she [00:46] stays next to me climb and she maintains [00:49] that heel position now when we do a [00:52] write about turn the dog what they have [00:54] to do is they have to increase speed as [00:56] they go around because even though [00:59] you're moving at the same speed when you [01:01] go to turn they have to move much faster [01:03] so what you're going to see when you're [01:05] first doing this is your dog is going to [01:07] lag all right what a lot of dogs will do [01:11] is you go to turn in the lag back this [01:13] way as you go around and then they'll [01:15] catch back up alright climb because they [01:18] don't realize go to climb re they don't [01:22] realize that they have to pick up speed [01:24] now at the left about turn it's even a [01:26] little bit more complicated re heel [01:28] because you're turning left and the dog [01:31] has to maintain that position climb I [01:34] used to tell my students this is a very [01:38] difficult behavior to perform so let's [01:41] say for example I'm the dog and I'm [01:43] walking with the handler I'm looking up [01:45] at the handler this is the motion our [01:46] dogs are doing it's very very difficult [01:51] it's not an easy behavior to be able to [01:54] accomplish even when you know what [01:56] you're doing so don't expect this to [01:58] happen overnight and you have to do a [02:00] lot of reps we're gonna do the right [02:02] about turn using just food and luring [02:05] with the left about turn we're gonna do [02:07] that using food and luring but we're [02:09] also going to do it with leash pressure [02:11] so I'm going to show you guys both [02:12] examples [02:13] so we're gonna take Ari here and bring [02:15] her back into he'll are you and what I [02:18] like to do when I'm first teaching this [02:20] as I go to turn I'm gonna step forward [02:23] with my left leg that's going to be the [02:25] last step that I take I'm gonna guide my [02:27] dog around the leg and into the side [02:30] position before I even turn are you let [02:34] me show you what it looks like quickly [02:36] and then I'm gonna break it down a [02:37] little bit more so I'll be walking and [02:39] then boom bring them around then I turn [02:42] what that's doing is it's increasing my [02:45] dog speed as I bring my dog around the [02:48] corner now I can also use climb I also [02:56] like to use my terminal marker when I'm [02:57] doing this exercise I'll walk forward [03:00] I'll bring the dog around my leg as my [03:03] dog is quickly going around that corner [03:04] and I'm intentionally making a little [03:06] bit harder making the dog work to get [03:08] around that corner then I'll use the [03:10] terminal marker and I'll bring the food [03:11] even more forward so it gets the dog [03:14] into that mindset when they're going [03:16] around a corner or when they're turning [03:17] in that right about turn they have to [03:20] increase speed so again are you it's [03:23] very simple to do we just step forward [03:25] bring free and reward let me show you [03:29] again [03:30] step four with the left leg open your [03:33] dog doesn't go Center bring the dog [03:36] around turn and walk okay here we go [03:43] step turn and walk and what some people [03:46] will do is they'll get the dog on the [03:48] side even take a step back before they [03:50] turn alright climb but you want to do [03:56] this over and over again [03:58] alright heel to the point where when you [04:01] go to do that right about turn you step [04:03] with that leg and when you turn your dog [04:05] is more likely to maintain that position [04:08] and stay in proper heel position free [04:13] good so you want to do a lot of reps [04:15] icon another thing that's going to help [04:19] you with the left about turn right about [04:21] turns pretty easy problem solving if you [04:25] want to increase your dog speed as well [04:26] when they're going [04:27] they're doing the right about turn [04:28] another thing I'd like to do is I like [04:30] to run after I make the turn to increase [04:34] my dog speed so let me show you what I [04:35] mean [04:36] are you so as we were walking I'll step [04:40] and then I'll turn and run good girl [04:43] hoping she doesn't jump into the center [04:45] position so we're walking oh oh what [04:49] happened there that wasn't right good [04:55] girl she's making some mistakes and it's [04:57] okay I also taught her to go Center when [05:04] I lift up my leg so that's why she's [05:06] doing that so again we turn and then [05:10] we'd run you can do this icon you can [05:15] also do this with a leash if you wanted [05:17] to let's say you have a dog that becomes [05:20] easily distracted when you're on a walk [05:22] even if you're not doing competition [05:24] obedience as you're walking when you go [05:27] to turn if they get distracted take a [05:30] couple quick steps all right climb as [05:32] you run in the opposite direction and by [05:36] doing that you have to be careful that [05:38] you do not correct the dog intentionally [05:41] meaning when you go to do the right [05:43] about turn you don't jump and pop the [05:45] leash what you want to do is you want [05:47] what I usually do is I'll take the leash [05:51] and I'll hold it onto my hip and this is [05:53] again this is if I'm not worried about [05:55] competition obedience I'm just trying to [05:57] get a dog that I'm working with to walk [06:00] on a leash nicely and to pay attention [06:02] to me more so when I'm going to take [06:04] that turn if they're not paying [06:05] attention I just take a couple quick [06:07] steps and if they're not paying [06:09] attention they're gonna feel the leash [06:10] they catch up to me and I go yeah good [06:12] puppy and I praise and reward them for [06:14] getting back into the position I want [06:16] them to be in and you'll quickly find [06:18] the next time you go to do this your [06:19] dogs I'm back oh right they're keeping [06:21] up with you maintaining that position so [06:24] that's a great exercise even if you're [06:26] not doing competition obedience now for [06:30] our take that dirt out of here now for [06:34] our left about turn when you do let your [06:37] left about turn you want to make sure [06:38] brick [06:40] that you can first get your dog to do [06:41] this pivot left and pivot right in place [06:46] now I talked about this in my power [06:48] steering video getting your dog to [06:50] really understand that concept of [06:53] following your hand climb this is going [06:56] to be the luring option all we're going [06:59] to do is we're simply going to use our [07:00] power steering as we go to turn we're [07:03] going to bring our hand down and we're [07:04] gonna help our dog pivot around into [07:06] position this is very similar to when [07:09] we're first teaching our dog to focus [07:10] heel and we're feeding them continuously [07:12] maintaining that position the dogs [07:15] following the food they're following the [07:17] lure they're not really paying attention [07:19] to what's going on so it does take a [07:22] little while for them to learn but it [07:23] helps develop that muscle memory [07:25] it helps teach them how to move their [07:27] body which is very important when you're [07:29] asking your dog to perform such a [07:31] complicated behavior all right so again [07:35] the first time you do this once you go [07:37] to turn bring the hand down pivot your [07:39] dog around and go back into walking you [07:42] could also use that spiral technique [07:44] that we talked about last week as you're [07:48] walking you have a spiral and that [07:50] spiral simply becomes smaller and [07:53] smaller until your dog is pivoting in [07:56] place and then you can help them by [07:58] using the food all right climb when you [08:03] have to do hundreds of those in order to [08:06] get it to where your dog is pivoting [08:07] around like Arya's and you might be able [08:10] to hear the puppy and they're getting [08:12] excited because she wants to train to [08:13] training should be fun every now and [08:17] then I could hear she wants to come out [08:18] and train that's a little hardly okay so [08:20] now when we're using the leash actually [08:24] I forgot to mention something else when [08:25] you are doing the left about turns [08:27] besides getting your dog good at [08:28] pivoting left and right by using that [08:30] power steering you also want to make [08:32] sure your dog understands the concept of [08:34] walking backwards all right when you [08:37] remember when we're teaching our dog to [08:38] walk backwards open hand means come to [08:41] us closed hand [08:43] I mean walks means to walk backwards [08:45] open hand come to us closed hand walk [08:49] backwards open [08:51] and backwards open you have some fun and [08:56] get your dog comfortable walking [08:57] backwards they have to have that ability [08:59] to be able to do that all right climb [09:01] not every dog can walk backwards [09:04] instinctively although sometimes if you [09:07] guys have like tight furniture your dog [09:09] walks between the futon my dogs will do [09:11] that sometimes when they'll get stuck [09:12] and they'll have to slowly walk [09:14] backwards it's kind of cute [09:16] but anyways all right so we're gonna put [09:17] the leash it also helps that you can get [09:22] your dog to walk backwards by using [09:24] leash pressure now I talked about this [09:26] in one of my other videos are you when I [09:29] first teach it I want to make sure that [09:32] the connector is on the back and I [09:35] usually I'm standing next to a wall to [09:38] prevent mistakes but since she knows it [09:41] I don't have to worry about that and if [09:43] you already taught your dog how to walk [09:44] backwards using the food you could do [09:46] the same thing when you're teaching the [09:48] leash pressure so what you want to do is [09:50] you want to first apply the pressure [09:52] then use your food lure to help the dog [09:55] understand what it is that you want you [09:58] can also do it without the food helping [10:00] but if your dog is still more [10:03] intermediate then using the food to help [10:04] will make a big difference so here's the [10:06] pressure then the food and we get him to [10:09] walk backwards release the pressure and [10:11] reward re and ideally you get to the [10:16] point where you can do this or you can [10:18] use that pressure free and you can walk [10:21] backwards with your dog and that's where [10:24] you want to be when you're doing this [10:25] left over about turning you're using [10:27] this technique so I'm gonna bring re [10:28] back in the heel and what I like to do [10:30] is I hold the leash behind my back this [10:33] is going to give that additional [10:35] guidance that my dog is going to need [10:37] when I'm first doing this exercise I'm [10:39] gonna say heel and I'm gonna step [10:40] forward with my left leg then when I go [10:43] to do the left about turn she's already [10:44] anticipating it so that's anticipation [10:47] right there you see how she's starting [10:48] to swing back she already knows that I'm [10:50] gonna do she's smart so then I would [10:52] apply the pressure as I turn ever so [10:55] slightly and then I release the pressure [10:56] so I'm walking here's the pressure helps [11:00] guide her and then I release and I could [11:03] do this anywhere I could do this [11:04] walk backwards pivot to the side and [11:10] it's a tool it's it's a way to help [11:13] guide our dog and I'm only using the [11:15] pressure yes when she needs it again we [11:20] go to walk and I go to turn I help with [11:23] the pressure I release the pressure and [11:26] when I'm teaching a dog to be able to [11:29] perform a left about turn like this [11:32] again I'm doing it hundreds of times [11:34] thousands of times alright climb a lot [11:38] of my trainer friends that compete [11:40] regularly what they'll do for their dogs [11:42] when they're doing left about turns are [11:44] right about turns they'll give them [11:45] little signals when I first went through [11:48] school to learn how to be a professional [11:50] dog trainer one of the instructors said [11:52] what he does is he would go he would [11:55] sniff through his nose before he would [11:58] do a left about turn every single time [11:59] so he's getting ready to left about turn [12:01] he goes and then he turns because in [12:04] competition you're not gonna get pointed [12:05] for breathing through your nose the only [12:08] problem is if you have a runny nose and [12:11] you're doing that you may not be aware [12:14] of it cuz I did that I taught my dog to [12:16] do the left about turn when I did that [12:19] and what happened was it was cold [12:21] outside I was training him and I had the [12:24] sniffles and I kept going and he kept [12:26] going back I'm like what are you doing [12:28] and it was because he was being cued up [12:30] that what some of my other friends will [12:32] do is they will look in the direction [12:34] that they're going to turn before they [12:35] turn so if they're doing a left about [12:37] turn they'll walk and they'll go and [12:39] then they'll turn and that again cused [12:42] the dog so it just depends on how far [12:44] you want to take this but just a quick [12:46] recap you want to make sure your dog [12:48] understands a concept of luring they [12:50] understand the concept of power-steering [12:51] you've worked the basic heel position [12:54] you can check out the ten fundamental [12:56] steps for teaching a focused heel and [12:59] you have worked your dog to get them to [13:02] understand walking backwards using the [13:05] food lure or using the leash pressure [13:07] and you've also taught the markers then [13:10] you go through and again do a lot of [13:12] reps have a lot of fun with it when I'm [13:14] training my dogs this is something else [13:16] a lot of people have asked they say [13:18] you you just train your dog and just to [13:21] set one command a bunch of times [13:24] no when I train my dog I want to make it [13:27] fun I want to make it engaging I want my [13:30] dog to have a good time and I want to [13:32] have a good time sometimes I'll even put [13:34] a headphone in so I'm listening to some [13:37] music I'm in a good mood if you're in a [13:39] good mood when you're working with your [13:40] dog your dog can sense that if you ever [13:42] get into a bad mood all right I'm gonna [13:45] bad mood right now I'm not gonna train [13:47] the dog don't train the dog do something [13:49] else because it could affect the [13:51] training so being a good mood have fun [13:53] but when I'm training like if I was [13:55] working with Ari right here this might [13:57] be a training session I might do some [13:58] healing I might walk backwards a little [14:00] bit down center might have her coming to [14:03] Center good girl Thanks see good girl [14:22] and we're gonna have fun we're gonna [14:24] have a good time mix it up anything [14:26] you're teaching your dog put it all into [14:28] one training session don't worry about [14:30] Cohn don't tell yourself oh I got to get [14:33] this one technique down so I'm just [14:35] gonna do it a hundred times that's gonna [14:37] be boring not only for you but also for [14:39] your dog so have a good time with it [14:40] have a lot of fun and make sure you guys [14:43] leave a comment make sure you hit that [14:45] like button subscribe and I'll see you [14:47] guys the next video thank you again for [14:49] [Music]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 448/468,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] thanks for joining us today this is Nate [00:01] Sean more professional dog trainer and [00:03] I'm gonna be answering some common [00:05] questions since these are common [00:07] questions you may already know the [00:09] answer to a lot of them and if that's [00:11] the case that just go down to the [00:13] description and jump to the section of [00:15] the video that has the questions that [00:17] you would like to learn a little bit [00:18] more about so the first question is [00:20] going to be what is the first thing you [00:22] try to teach a dog when training the [00:25] very first thing that I like to do with [00:26] any dog that I'm training it doesn't [00:28] matter if I'm training basic obedience [00:30] service dog training protection training [00:33] search-and-rescue you name it the [00:35] process is always the same the very [00:37] first thing that I like to do is [00:39] engagement training I want to teach the [00:41] dog that I'm going to pay them and [00:43] there's value to being engaged and [00:45] focusing on me if your dog is focused on [00:47] you they're going to be able to learn [00:49] much faster another thing that I really [00:51] focus on is getting the dog to enjoy the [00:54] training that is probably even more [00:56] important than the dog learning the [00:58] markers we're teaching them the markers [01:00] in the very first session so those [01:02] condition reinforcers the sounds that [01:04] predict the rewards but we want to make [01:06] the training fun and we want to teach [01:08] the dog how to learn so we want them to [01:11] enjoy it the more that they enjoy it the [01:13] more likely they are to enjoy it when [01:15] they get older and the easier it's going [01:17] to be to teach them new behaviors so do [01:19] everything you can to make the training [01:22] session fun it should not be stressful [01:24] I've heard other people say you should [01:26] focus on precision first obedience first [01:29] and attitude later I completely disagree [01:32] I want my dogs to enjoy the training and [01:34] that's something else people have asked [01:36] me they say how is your dog so focused [01:38] on you every time I see the video even [01:40] when you're talking your dog is focused [01:42] on you and they're focused on me because [01:44] I always made training fun ever since I [01:46] once I have them as a puppy I'm working [01:48] with them I'm building them up I'm doing [01:50] confidence-building exercises and I'm [01:52] making the training as fun as possible [01:53] if I can I try to make the training the [01:57] most fun that the dog will have [01:59] throughout the day I make that the [02:01] absolute best so every time you're [02:03] getting ready to train it's something [02:05] that your dog has been looking forward [02:06] to so that's going to be the first thing [02:08] that I like to focus on I want to make [02:10] sure the dog is [02:11] and a good time and I want to teach the [02:13] dog the marker so those sounds that [02:15] predict the rewards remember this is [02:17] based on the studies that were conducted [02:19] by Yvonne Pavlov the Russian [02:21] psychologist he basically this is the [02:23] dinner-bell theory he had a sound that [02:26] would go off prior to his food being [02:28] prior to the food being delivered to the [02:29] dogs and after a certain amount of [02:31] repetition [02:32] each dog varied the dogs would begin to [02:34] salivate before the food was even [02:36] present and that's what he called [02:37] classical conditioning if you think [02:40] about it though all he really did was he [02:42] renamed a word and the word that he [02:44] renamed was predictability but he's a [02:46] scientist so he has to come out and say [02:48] I came up with something new classical [02:50] conditioning and all he did was renamed [02:53] a word predictability because he did [02:55] further studies if the sound went off [02:57] while the food was being delivered to [02:59] the dogs or the sound went off while the [03:01] dogs were eating the food then they [03:02] never became conditioned to the sound [03:04] because at that point it is never or at [03:06] that point it has not become predictable [03:08] because the sound is being paired [03:10] remember it has to be predictable so [03:12] that's that first step [03:13] teaching our dog the conditioned [03:15] reinforcers that we can use in our [03:17] training to help communicate more [03:19] effectively with them okay next question [03:21] what's the best way to train a kid to [03:23] handle a puppy what's your best advice [03:25] when it comes to kids and dogs so I've [03:28] worked with a lot of families that have [03:29] kids and more often than not the kids [03:32] learn faster than the adults do they [03:34] pick it up and they start applying it [03:36] right away so you want to teach them how [03:38] to train the dogs the same way I teach [03:40] in these videos show them how to do the [03:42] markers make sure they understand that [03:44] they shouldn't be pairing their physical [03:46] with their verbal show them how to [03:47] properly pet the dog that's a big one [03:50] especially really young kids they don't [03:52] know how to pet a dog properly if you [03:54] know how to pet a dog properly the dog [03:55] is going to want to be around you and [03:57] that's something that may come naturally [03:59] to adults and that's something you have [04:02] to show a young child how to do how to [04:04] pet the dog in a way that the dog is [04:06] going to like it and it's going to be a [04:08] nice experience for the dog and then [04:10] teaching the child everything else how [04:12] to start shaping behaviors how to lure [04:14] the dog into different positions how to [04:16] properly feed the dog I'm going to if [04:19] I'm working with let's say my niece or [04:21] my nephew I'm gonna show them everything [04:24] step that I teach an adult how to train [04:27] their dog I'm not going to say Oh your [04:30] kids so I'm not going to pay that much [04:32] attention to what I'm showing you I'm [04:33] just gonna show you the simple basics [04:35] barebone I'm gonna show them as much as [04:38] I possibly can as long as they're [04:39] interested in learning about what it is [04:41] that I'm teaching them and like I said [04:43] more often than not the kids do better [04:45] than the adults so teach them the [04:46] markers teach them how to lure the dog [04:48] with food teach them how to handle the [04:50] leash properly show them every single [04:52] step and also teach them that they need [04:53] to respect the dogs I think it's great [04:55] to get a dog for a kid but it's also [04:57] important to teach them how to train [05:00] that dog often kids don't realize how [05:03] much work is involved in raising a young [05:05] puppy or a dog but if we empower them [05:08] and we showed them how to train and work [05:10] with the dog then you'll find that they [05:12] have a best friend for life and it'll [05:14] also teach them compassion all right the [05:16] next question I have three dogs what is [05:19] the best way to work with all three if [05:21] I'm training multiple dogs that I want [05:23] to be able to work and do obedience at [05:25] the same time first I'm going to train [05:27] each dog separately I'm gonna work with [05:29] each one I'm gonna teach them the [05:30] communication channels I'm going to [05:32] teach them what behaviors are expected [05:33] from them I'm gonna teach them how to [05:35] turn off pressure by compliant that's [05:36] that leash pressure training and I'm [05:38] gonna build their confidence up and get [05:40] them to work in areas with more [05:41] distractions and then as each dog [05:43] becomes proficient in the obedience then [05:46] I start to bring them together if I'm [05:48] working three first I'm going to bring [05:49] two together I'm gonna have to work [05:51] together and then the other two work [05:52] together and then as they all start to [05:54] understand that concept of doing [05:56] obedience while they're with one another [05:58] then I bring all three into the pitcher [06:00] and I do everything again each time you [06:02] add a new element it's almost like [06:04] you're starting over because the dog is [06:06] looking at it at a different situation [06:07] or they're looking at it rather as it [06:09] being a different situation and dogs are [06:11] very situational so the dog goes well I [06:14] never have to do obedience normally when [06:16] the other dog is here it's only when [06:18] it's you and me and we're in the [06:19] backyard and you have your training vest [06:20] on and you have the treats that's when I [06:22] do obedience not right now so you have [06:25] to show them no right now you have to do [06:27] it as well and you have to do it in this [06:28] environment and you have to do it in [06:30] that environment [06:30] and you have to do it if there's one [06:32] person watching or 20 people watching or [06:34] ten dogs or 20 dogs you have to show [06:37] them in every single environment until [06:39] they become generalized to the training [06:41] and for most dogs it's usually around 8 [06:43] or 9 when they get to that point where [06:46] they are generalized to it so 8 or 9 new [06:48] environments 8 or 9 new different [06:51] distractions 8 or 9 different command [06:54] like let's say for example the climb [06:56] command if you teach the dog to only [06:59] climb on one platform then that's only [07:01] going to be the one climb that they know [07:03] but if you teach them climb means to [07:05] climb on their bed climb means to climb [07:06] into the vehicle to climb in on a park [07:10] bench to climb on a rock wall on a hike [07:12] a big boulder or something like that we [07:15] start using these climb commands in [07:16] different situations and the dog will [07:18] become generalized to it so again to [07:21] answer your question we train each dog [07:23] individually then we bring them all [07:25] together for that final product [07:27] I was just made aware of fear periods I [07:28] was wondering if you'd consider doing a [07:30] video on how to work through this [07:31] positively okay most dogs do go through [07:34] a fear period one thing you don't want [07:37] to do is you don't want to try petting [07:39] them and rewarding them for being afraid [07:41] so if the dog starts to become afraid [07:43] you don't want to take the dog and go [07:44] it's okay it's okay Shh it's not gonna [07:47] be alright because basically what you're [07:49] doing is you're telling the dog it's [07:50] good to be afraid that's a good dog you [07:53] should really be afraid good dog I'm [07:55] gonna reward you for being afraid [07:57] remember when we are rewarding a dog we [07:59] are rewarding a dog for what they're [08:01] doing [08:01] in that moment in time and that's why [08:04] our markers are so important because [08:06] we're able to pinpoint a moment in time [08:07] to let the dog know they're doing [08:09] something that we like so instead of [08:11] doing something like that what I like to [08:13] do if I start to notice a dog is going [08:15] through a fear period and there's [08:16] certain things that are triggering the [08:17] fear then I will try to do positive [08:20] Association or if the dog is already [08:23] afraid of something we could do counter [08:24] conditioning and all that's doing is [08:26] taking something that the dog is afraid [08:29] of because they think it may predict [08:30] something bad and instead making it [08:32] predict something pleasant for example [08:35] if a dog was afraid of fireworks I'm [08:37] going to slowly get the dog comfortable [08:39] the sound of fireworks while rewarding [08:41] the [08:42] with maybe a treat or maybe their [08:43] mealtime I'm actually going to be [08:45] putting a video up just on this so if [08:48] you have a dog that's afraid of [08:49] fireworks now is a great time to start [08:51] what I like to do is what every single [08:54] meal up until the point where the dog [08:56] until the fourth of July what you're [08:58] going to do is you're going to we have [09:00] YouTube so fantastic pull up YouTube [09:03] pull up a video of fireworks going off [09:04] and then play the fireworks going off [09:07] before you feed your dog so play the [09:09] video then place your dog's food down [09:12] and let them eat start at a very low [09:14] value and then as the dog gets more [09:17] comfortable eating what that sound going [09:19] on then slowly increase the volume up [09:22] into the point where it's almost as loud [09:23] as it can be right before the fourth of [09:25] July so then when fireworks start to go [09:27] off you have conditioned your dog to [09:29] realize that fireworks actually means [09:32] something Pleasant they're going to get [09:33] a reward they're going to get a treat we [09:35] add value to it by what it predicts that [09:37] is the most important thing for example [09:40] my dog ari she went through a fear [09:42] period where she was afraid of other [09:43] people she would bark at them her [09:45] hackles would go up lucky for me I have [09:47] a lot of dog trainer friends and what I [09:49] did for two weeks I didn't feed her me [09:51] personally I did not give her any food [09:53] she still ate every single day but what [09:55] I did was I would meet up with my [09:57] friends that understand dogs and their [09:59] dog trainers and I would give them each [10:01] a certain amount of food to feed to my [10:04] dog so that would be my dog's meal and [10:06] at first they just stood there casually [10:08] acting like they weren't even paying [10:10] attention to her holding the food down [10:12] by their side and then she would come up [10:14] and take the food from their hand almost [10:16] as if she was stealing it so they [10:18] weren't being frontal they weren't doing [10:20] these normal behaviors that humans do [10:22] when they see a dog a lot of times we [10:24] become very frontal we're like oh that's [10:26] a cute puppy and we get really close to [10:28] them and that can be intimidating to [10:29] some dogs especially dogs that are going [10:31] through a fear period so by not looking [10:33] at them that takes away a lot of that [10:35] pressure and that's what they did and [10:37] then as my dog became more comfortable [10:39] and her confidence started to go up they [10:42] started to turn a little bit more they [10:43] started to become more frontal and then [10:45] by the end of the second week she was so [10:47] excited to see every single one of them [10:49] because they predicted something nice [10:51] this is the most important thing we're [10:53] dealing with a new dog or a puppy and [10:55] we're raising them [10:56] we want to take every experience and we [10:58] want to make it positive [10:59] by having it predict something pleasant [11:01] whether its food whether it's a toy [11:03] whether it's petting but again you don't [11:05] want to pet them when they're acting [11:07] fearful you want to reward them when [11:09] they're not acting fearful and if you [11:11] try to have your dog presented by [11:14] something and they're acting too afraid [11:16] then you need to back off a little bit [11:18] and have it to where they're more [11:19] comfortable so let's use the fireworks [11:21] for an example if I turned on the [11:24] computer and I played that video with [11:27] fireworks going off and I played it too [11:28] loud and it startled my dog then I would [11:30] have to turn it down because it's too [11:32] loud I need to start where it's not [11:35] going to be intimidating the dog and as [11:37] my dog becomes more comfortable with it [11:39] we're desensitizing them to it but we're [11:41] also teaching them that the sound [11:42] predicts something pleasant think about [11:44] it and imagine if I worked with you and [11:47] every single day it's like you could [11:49] take anything and you can make it be [11:51] pleasant by what it predicts so let's [11:54] say I was just some annoying co-worker [11:56] and every day I went up to you and I [11:57] pinched the back of your arm you're [11:59] really gonna get annoyed with me and [12:01] you're not gonna like me one bit but [12:02] imagine it every single time I pinched [12:04] your arm I handed you a hundred-dollar [12:06] bill you would be looking for me to [12:08] pinch your eye coming to you you want to [12:10] pinch my arm I want that hundred bucks [12:11] because of what it predicts we change [12:13] what it means by what it predicts and [12:15] it's the same with our dogs [12:16] I have a ten-month-old border collie we [12:18] watched your videos do you have any tips [12:20] on getting him to focused he's very [12:22] hyper and distracted even after exercise [12:25] and we find it difficult to get focused [12:28] on tasks I can only use his basic kibble [12:30] to train because he gets so excited so [12:33] if you if you progress too quickly and [12:36] training it's always good to go back [12:38] steps so if I'm working with a dog and [12:40] I'm on my second step in my training so [12:43] my first step is always teaching the dog [12:44] the markers getting them to enjoy the [12:46] turn getting them to enjoy the training [12:48] second step is always showing them how [12:50] to perform the behaviors I would like [12:52] them to perform with a physical cue [12:53] third step is naming those behaviors by [12:56] making sure we say the name of the [12:57] command before the physical cue and then [12:59] I like to teach the dog the concept of [13:01] leash pressure so they know how to turn [13:02] off pressure by complying which actually [13:05] increases their confidence and speeds up [13:07] the training so if I have a dog that I'm [13:09] working with [13:10] and I'm on my second step where I'm [13:12] starting to name the command and I'm [13:13] losing focus from my dog I'm gonna go [13:16] back to engagement training I'm gonna [13:18] show the dog that they need to pay [13:19] attention to me and I'm gonna work that [13:21] a little bit longer to get my dog to [13:22] understand the concept of looking up at [13:24] me in order to get that reward a lot of [13:27] times dogs won't naturally look at us in [13:29] our face we have to show them like hey [13:31] looking at our face is a good thing and [13:34] not only is it a good thing I'm gonna [13:35] reward you for that and then it's going [13:37] to be something that our dogs are going [13:39] to seek out a little bit more I have a [13:40] video entirely on teaching our dog the [13:43] markers and how to get them more focused [13:45] so if this is something that you're [13:47] working on check out that video I think [13:49] it'll help you out quite a bit [13:50] our beagle barks when one of us come [13:52] home we tried ignoring him but he seems [13:54] to carry on even more any tips for this [13:56] anytime our dog is doing a behavior we [13:59] don't like we always have to think about [14:01] the concept of motivation everything our [14:04] dogs do is based on motivation there [14:06] either motivated to access something [14:08] pleasant they're motivated to prevent [14:09] something unpleasant or the activity [14:11] itself is fun and that becomes the [14:13] motivation so if you come home and [14:16] you're trying to think well what is it [14:17] that my dog wants does my dog want my [14:19] attention does is my dog just barking [14:21] because barking is fun if your dog wants [14:24] your attention one of the techniques [14:26] that you can use is when you walk inside [14:28] if the dog starts to bark say one note [14:30] and then leave show the dog that barking [14:33] is going to make you go away if your dog [14:34] wants you to be there and it's barking [14:36] out of excitement if your dog learns [14:38] that barking makes you go away then [14:40] they'll quickly stop the barking so what [14:43] I'll even do it I'll do it very very [14:44] quick so I'll start to walk away the [14:46] moment the dog is quiet I turn back [14:48] around the dog starts to bark again I go [14:50] to leave again and I continue this until [14:52] the dog understands it's the barking [14:54] that makes me go away and being quiet is [14:56] what brings me to them we always have to [14:59] think about that concept of cause and [15:01] effect and how it's going to affect our [15:03] dog's motivation now this doesn't work [15:06] and your dog still continues to bark we [15:09] have to think about the concept of using [15:10] positive punishment this is the four [15:13] quadrants of opera conditioning positive [15:15] and negative reinforcement positive and [15:17] negative punishment it just depends on [15:19] what you want and what you want to do [15:20] with your own dog but if your [15:23] able to redirect the dog to a different [15:25] behavior if using the no and leaving and [15:28] showing the dog that dumb barking is [15:30] making you go away is not working if [15:32] your dog simply enjoys barking because [15:34] barking is fun then you're going to have [15:36] to use a correction to remove it from [15:38] the dog's repertoire and the easiest or [15:41] the best way to do that is using a leash [15:43] and a collar I never recommend using [15:45] your hands to correct a dog because our [15:47] hands should always be a good thing it [15:49] should always be a positive thing but if [15:52] the dog is barking you say one no you [15:53] would take the leash you would give the [15:55] dog leash pop the moment that they're [15:57] quiet you go yay good puppy and you [15:59] reward them for doing what it is that [16:01] you want any time we correct a dog if [16:03] you do have to correct your dog and I'm [16:05] not telling anybody to correct their dog [16:06] you don't have to you can get a lot from [16:09] your dog by implementing three of the [16:11] four quadrants you can use positive [16:13] reinforcement negative punishment which [16:15] is not giving your dog a treat if they [16:17] don't perform the behavior correctly and [16:18] negative reinforcement which is leash [16:20] pressure you don't have to use positive [16:22] punishment but if you find yourself [16:24] struggling and you think it's going to [16:25] help then you can use positive [16:27] punishment you want to keep in mind the [16:30] analogy that every single dog has their [16:32] own bank account some of our dogs are [16:34] rich some of our dogs are poor so [16:37] imagine you're driving down the highway [16:38] police officer pulls you over right to a [16:40] 25 spent son speeding ticket that's not [16:43] going to be enough to change your [16:44] behavior you're going to continue to [16:45] speed but let's say on the other extreme [16:47] end of the spectrum he writes you a 250 [16:51] thousand dollar speeding ticket now [16:52] you're gonna avoid the behavior entirely [16:54] you're not going to want to drive you're [16:55] gonna be stressed out you're gonna take [16:57] a lift from now on that's an avoidance [16:59] level correction a correction so high [17:00] you and avoid the behavior entirely [17:02] let's say he gives you a $200 speeding [17:05] ticket that's enough to get you to slow [17:06] down without getting you to avoid the [17:08] behavior of driving it's the same with [17:10] our dogs if you're going to use a [17:11] correction so in this situation the dog [17:13] barks you say one no you give the dog a [17:15] correction the correction should be [17:17] adequate to that dogs bank account you [17:19] don't want to correct too high you don't [17:20] want to correct too low you want to do [17:22] it right at that dogs working level or [17:25] correction level so the dog gets the [17:27] correction again the moment they're [17:28] quiet we praise and we reward them it's [17:31] important to reward a dog after you [17:33] correct them the moment [17:34] doing exactly what you want them to be [17:36] doing but that's gonna be some of the [17:38] best ways to fix a dog that is barking [17:40] when you come home because again they're [17:42] barking because they're excited to see [17:44] you and they want you to be there so if [17:45] you show marking makes you go away then [17:47] we are hoping that the barking will stop [17:50] how to keep my dog in a stay position [17:52] when I answered the door he is nosy and [17:53] when he wants to see who's out there and [17:55] if it's someone he doesn't know he will [17:56] growl and he'll start to bark in a mean [17:58] sort of way if you have a dog that barks [18:00] at people walking by or barks at people [18:02] when they come over then you need to [18:04] rehearse the situation so have somebody [18:06] that you know come over anytime one of [18:08] the family members are coming over have [18:10] them text you and let you know that [18:12] they're about to be there and so you [18:13] could be ready to work with your dog and [18:15] take advantage of that situation we have [18:17] to practice what we want our dogs to [18:19] perform and we have to practice every [18:21] single situation and show our dog [18:23] exactly what we want them to do in that [18:25] specific situation what I like to do is [18:28] use the climb command again the climb [18:29] command is the easiest command to [18:31] reinforce it's the easiest stay command [18:33] to teach and it's very easy to implement [18:36] using it in training situations just [18:38] like this one so you have somebody that [18:40] you know knock on the door and if your [18:43] dog reacts then you make sure you direct [18:45] them back to the climb and then you go [18:47] answer the door and you keep doing this [18:48] over and over again getting the dog [18:50] desensitize to somebody ringing the [18:52] doorbell or knocking on the door and [18:53] showing them exactly what they need to [18:55] do so that would be staying on the climb [18:57] stay and I have a video exactly how to [19:00] teach the stay and it doesn't matter [19:01] what kind of stay I'm teaching sit stay [19:03] down stay climb stay stand state heel [19:06] stay all of the stays the process is [19:09] always the same we shown the position if [19:11] we want to reward them we use the [19:13] continuation marker or we can give them [19:15] verbal praise and then if they break the [19:17] position we say one note and we place [19:20] them back into the position they just [19:21] broke so we show it we're showing them [19:23] if you mess up I'm gonna show you [19:25] exactly what you need to do to fix it [19:27] and when we do that then the dog learns [19:29] how to turn off pressure by compliant [19:31] because when we're reinforcing a [19:32] position in a sense we become the [19:34] pressure so the dog breaks the position [19:36] you say no now your dog goes oh I know [19:38] what you're about to do next and they go [19:39] back to the climb but on their own but [19:41] the best thing you need to do are the [19:43] most important thing rather that you [19:44] need to do is practice [19:46] rehearse it so then when somebody does [19:48] come over your dog knows exactly what to [19:51] do we are moving from a rural area to [19:53] the city we have people walking up and [19:55] down the sidewalk in front of our street [19:56] constantly how do we stop the dogs from [19:58] barking at them okay so again we need to [20:01] think about motivation what is [20:03] motivating our dogs to bark some dogs [20:06] again will bark because they enjoy [20:07] barking some dogs will bark because they [20:09] actually think that their barking is [20:11] getting people to go away that goes back [20:13] to the cause and effect this is why so [20:15] many dogs bark at the male person the [20:17] male person comes over drops off the [20:19] male the dog barks the male person walks [20:22] away the dog goes I made that person go [20:24] away and that reinforces the behavior of [20:27] barking if we're looking at issues we [20:31] have behavioral issues and we have [20:32] obedience issues behavioral issues is [20:35] anything that the dog does that is not [20:38] related to obedience so the dog digs I [20:41] don't want the dog to dig the dog drinks [20:42] out of the toilet bowl the dog gets into [20:44] the trashcan the dog jumps up on people [20:46] these the dog chews on furniture [20:48] these are behavioral issues obedience [20:50] issues the dog doesn't come when I call [20:52] them the dog doesn't stay in and down [20:53] the dog doesn't sit when I tell them to [20:55] sit these are obedience issues when it [20:58] comes to behavioral issues the fastest [21:00] way to remove them is by using a [21:03] correction so you have a few different [21:05] options you can redirect the dog to a [21:07] different command every single time they [21:09] bark at somebody going by you redirect [21:11] them to maybe the climb across the room [21:14] where they can't see people or you [21:15] redirect them into a down you have to [21:18] redirect them to something or the next [21:20] option is you correct it you remove it [21:23] out of the dog's repertoire you have a [21:25] leash you have a collar on the dog you [21:27] have somebody walk by the moment that [21:29] the dog barks you go No and you give the [21:31] dog a correction the moment they're [21:32] quiet you praise and reward them so [21:35] there are different options and some [21:37] work faster than others some may take [21:40] longer and some may not even work on [21:42] certain dogs that's why it's so [21:44] important to understand the science of [21:46] dog training the science of dog training [21:47] is well everything our dogs do is based [21:50] on motivation and humans are the exact [21:52] same way we always do whatever is most [21:54] motivating our dogs are no different [21:56] we have to make sure that we control the [21:59] motivating factors which will control [22:01] the dog's behavior so the dog enjoys [22:03] barking at people as they walk by and [22:06] you want that to be removed either you [22:10] can redirect or you can teach the dog [22:13] when they see another dog you quickly [22:15] get their attention the moment they look [22:17] at you you reward them so then you show [22:19] them if you see it a human walking by or [22:21] another dog what I want you to do is [22:23] quickly look at me and then I will give [22:25] you a reward for that behavior and then [22:27] what you'll find on a long enough time [22:28] line the dog will be looking for people [22:30] walking by so they can look at you to [22:32] get a treat which is much better than [22:34] barking again that's using the [22:36] motivation the dog wants the treat the [22:37] dog knows that looking at a person and [22:39] then looking at you predicts a treat so [22:41] then they repeat that behavior and then [22:43] like I said the other option is using a [22:45] correction so the dog's motivation not [22:47] to get corrected overrides of the [22:49] motivation to bark at the dogs walking [22:50] by this is the same reason why most [22:53] people choose not to rob the bank the [22:55] motivation not to go to jail overrides [22:58] the motivation to make a quick buck so [23:00] we always have to keep in mind what is [23:02] motivating our dogs and then we can use [23:04] that information to apply the right [23:06] technique to get the results that we [23:07] want what would be your five top medium [23:09] size breeds for service dog work any dog [23:12] any breed rather can be a service dog [23:15] and breeds will help give you an idea of [23:19] what the dog is going to be like but [23:20] every dog is going to be an individual [23:23] dog I really enjoy training labs I enjoy [23:26] training golden retrievers Standard [23:29] Poodles German Shepherds Border Collies [23:32] these are all phenomenal dogs when it [23:35] comes to teaching them tasks because [23:36] they're highly intelligent and they love [23:39] to make their owner happy they love to [23:42] please their owner or whoever it is that [23:44] they're working with they're usually [23:45] very motivated very fun intelligent dogs [23:47] to work with the border collie one [23:50] I wouldn't recommend somebody having a [23:52] border collie as a service dog unless [23:55] they are very active so maybe a border [23:58] collie would make a great PTSD service [24:00] dog with somebody who is not physically [24:04] disabled meaning they can walk they can [24:07] run they can do things like that but [24:09] they are struggling [24:10] PTSD or some sort of other condition and [24:13] they're able to go out and they're able [24:15] to stay active with their dog a border [24:17] collie could be great for somebody like [24:19] that because they can play fetch they [24:20] can do a lot of great activities and the [24:22] dog can still provide services that will [24:24] help this person who's suffering from [24:26] PTSD so that's something to keep in mind [24:28] what is it that the dog is going to be [24:30] doing how much Drive do you want the dog [24:32] to have again like I said boric Ali's [24:35] usually have more Drive they usually [24:37] have more intelligent and if you don't [24:38] stimulate that mind they can become [24:40] destructive so we just have to keep in [24:42] mind what the dog is going to be for but [24:44] those are my five top dogs I guess I [24:47] would say for service dog work that I [24:49] like to Train what are the best treats [24:51] for dog training okay the best treats [24:53] for dog training is going to be what [24:55] your dog enjoys and what is healthy I [24:57] don't like giving a lot of those [24:59] sugar-filled treats that you could find [25:01] at a lot of the local pet stores my [25:03] go-to is freeze-dried dog food most dogs [25:06] love it and it's very healthy so find a [25:09] treat that not only is something your [25:11] dog enjoys and they're willing to work [25:13] for but something that is healthy you [25:15] can also use the dog's kibble if I am [25:18] feeding a dog kibble I like to get a [25:19] better quality kibble I wouldn't like to [25:22] feed something like kibbles and bits [25:24] that's horrible dog food I wouldn't like [25:26] to feed any dog Beneful that's pretty [25:29] junk as well you need to read the label [25:31] on the back if there is you don't want [25:34] dog food that has by-product a lot of [25:38] by-product isn't good meal isn't good if [25:40] it says beef meal you don't want [25:42] anything you want whole animals you want [25:44] whole chicken whole beef you don't want [25:46] a bunch of rice you don't want a bunch [25:48] of fillers and if they have colors added [25:50] to it you definitely don't want those so [25:52] like Beneful for example if you look at [25:55] the label you'll see near the bottom [25:56] that it has blue number two green three [26:00] red four avoid those foods you can also [26:04] use a website dog food advisor com they [26:07] give they give a star rating for the dog [26:10] foods based on the quality of the food [26:13] where it's coming from [26:14] how much protein it has how much fat and [26:17] how many carbohydrates and they give the [26:19] star rating based on the type of food so [26:22] for example if you see a [26:24] food that is 4.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 449/468,5 stars and then you see [26:26] a kibble that is 5 stars that does not [26:29] mean that the kibble is better than the [26:31] raw because the raw is rated up against [26:34] other raw foods the canned is rated up [26:36] against other canned food the kibble is [26:38] rated up against other kibbles so you [26:40] have to keep that in mind raw is almost [26:43] always better than kibble but if you are [26:46] feeding kibble look for one that's a [26:47] five-star brand and that's going to be a [26:49] much better quality and it will make a [26:51] great treat what would you say are the [26:53] key principles to keep in mind every day [26:55] when you train your dog alright the [26:57] primary principles when training a dog [26:58] is going to be timing motivation and [27:00] consistency but also making the training [27:03] fun I said this earlier in the video the [27:05] more fun that your dog is having the [27:07] faster they're going to learn and [27:09] they're gonna look forward to training [27:10] and training is going to be a very [27:12] pleasant enjoyable experience I [27:14] recommend if you have a dog I recommend [27:16] training that dog for life a lot of time [27:18] people think oh I get my dog once my dog [27:21] knows all the behaviors I never have to [27:23] train them again training is an activity [27:25] that not only should be fun for your dog [27:28] but it also helps create a very strong [27:31] bond this is something that people [27:33] always say if I train their dog they say [27:35] it seems like our dog likes you even [27:37] more now it's like well yep for the past [27:39] two weeks I've been talking to your dog [27:41] we've been hanging out I've been [27:42] communicating with them the dogs like [27:43] finally somebody who speaks my language [27:45] and when you communicate with them then [27:48] you build a stronger bond you need to [27:50] talk to your dogs every day and training [27:52] is one of the best ways to do that [27:54] making the training fun timing is very [27:56] important it's been scientifically [27:59] proven that we have approximately one [28:01] second to influence a dog's behavior so [28:03] if you are one second off when a dog is [28:06] doing something you're trying to capture [28:07] you could be teaching the dog a [28:09] completely different behavior so timing [28:11] is very important that's why we use our [28:13] conditioned reinforcers those are the [28:15] sounds that predict a reward so when our [28:17] dog does a behavior we have one second [28:20] to either give them the primary [28:21] reinforcer or we have one second to give [28:24] them the conditioned reinforcer and then [28:26] follow it up with the primary remember [28:28] the conditioned reinforcer predicts the [28:30] primary this is going to be my yes and [28:32] my free when I'm training my dogs [28:34] those pinpoint a moment in time [28:35] and they predict a reward this is very [28:37] similar to money or paycheck for a human [28:40] money and a page cash money and [28:42] paychecks [28:43] those are condition reinforcers because [28:45] they predict the primary if I gave you [28:47] ten thousand dollars and I said you can [28:49] never spend this ever in your entire [28:51] life you can never give it to anybody [28:52] you can never use it it just has to sit [28:54] in your closet it becomes worthless it [28:57] has value because what it predicts you [28:59] can go buy what you need you can go buy [29:01] food you can buy toys electronics [29:02] whatever it is that is a conditioned [29:05] reinforcer for our dogs it's a sound [29:07] that predicts the reward so when they do [29:09] a behavior if we cannot get them the [29:11] primary reinforcer within a second then [29:13] we use the conditioned reinforcer so the [29:15] dog's butt hits the ground yes the dog [29:18] knows that they're gonna be rewarded for [29:21] their butt hitting the ground and you [29:23] can come and take your time to give them [29:24] the reward and even though the reward [29:27] may have come way after the dog did the [29:29] behavior the dog knows whatever they [29:31] were doing when they heard that sound [29:32] that is what they are being rewarded for [29:34] and that helps us with our timing so [29:37] timing very important motivation I talk [29:39] about this all the time we have to [29:41] figure out what motivates our dog [29:43] that's why dog training is an art and [29:45] it's a science you have to understand [29:47] the science in order to master the art [29:49] but you master the art by figuring out [29:51] the dog that you're working with how [29:53] intelligent is this dog how much [29:55] perseverance does this dog have dogs [29:58] with higher-level perseverance will be [30:00] willing to work harder in order to get [30:02] the reward dogs with a lower level of [30:05] perseverance may give up earlier so you [30:07] have to be aware of that does the dog [30:09] enjoy a certain type of treat does the [30:11] dog enjoy playing with toys what can I [30:14] use to get this dog motivated to perform [30:16] the tasks that we are trying to teach [30:18] them so motivation very important and [30:20] then consistency could be the most [30:22] important probably is the most important [30:24] is consistency because even if your [30:26] timing is off even if you don't have the [30:29] best motivation or the tools to get the [30:31] dog to perform if you are consistent [30:34] every single day your dog will learn so [30:36] consistency then is the most important [30:38] timing motivation consistency and make [30:41] sure that the training is as fun as [30:43] possible never train when you're in a [30:45] bad mood always make sure you're in a [30:47] great mood your dog will feed off of [30:48] that [30:49] and make the training fun again that's [30:50] something I do with my dogs that's why [30:52] they love training so much that's why [30:54] when you see my videos charlie it looks [30:57] like he's just happy to be there he's [30:59] super excited ari is excited to Train [31:01] it's because I'm a training fun and you [31:03] could do that too with your dogs what is [31:04] your opinion on feeding a raw diet I [31:06] think a raw diet is the best way to go a [31:09] resource that I recommend everybody [31:11] check out is dr.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 450/468,Karen Becker [31:13] I also recommend watching the [31:15] documentary Pet fooled [31:16] that's pet fo LED and a raw diet is [31:21] biologically appropriate for our dogs [31:23] they have more stomach acid than we do [31:26] so they're able to process it they get [31:27] more of the vitamins more of the [31:29] minerals both of my dogs Charlie and Ari [31:31] are both on Raw and they do fantastic on [31:34] it I feed them what I give my dogs is I [31:36] give them raw food so I feed them twice [31:38] a day in the morning and in the evening [31:39] and then on Sundays I fast them so I'll [31:42] only feed that one meal on Sunday I give [31:45] them raw bones so those big thick raw [31:47] bones with the bone marrow on the inside [31:49] and the raw meat on the outside I give [31:51] that to them as a treat and it helps [31:53] keep their canines clean I also give [31:54] them freeze-dried dog treats and I will [31:57] also give them bully sticks so that's [31:59] mainly what my dogs consume and they're [32:02] in great shape they're very healthy most [32:04] people over feed their dogs as well [32:06] you're less likely to over feed your dog [32:09] if you're feeding them raw when I feed [32:10] raw weigh out each meal so I know [32:12] exactly what I'm giving my dog and this [32:14] is a good point to bring up why a lot of [32:16] people have overweight dogs and one of [32:19] the main reasons is when you have them [32:21] as a young pup their metabolism is much [32:23] higher and you have to feed them way [32:25] more for example Harley right now that [32:28] I'm training she is on a kibble and I'm [32:31] giving her six cups a day so she's [32:33] eating six cups a day that is more than [32:36] what Ari and Charlie eat combined but [32:39] it's because she's growing so what a lot [32:41] of people will do is they will continue [32:43] to feed their dog that six cups a day [32:45] even when they become an adult and then [32:47] they wonder why their dog's getting fat [32:48] it's because they're feeding them too [32:50] much so you have to adjust according to [32:52] your dog's metabolism and according to [32:54] your dog's age but to answer your [32:56] question I think raw hands down is the [32:58] best way to go I like to buy premade raw [33:01] pet food [33:02] you can make raw food or you can prep [33:04] raw meals yourself but if you're going [33:06] to do that I would recommend doing the [33:08] proper research because if you're not [33:09] doing it correctly you can cause more [33:11] harm than good [33:12] that's why I'll just buy raw dog food at [33:16] the pet store and my dogs love it and it [33:18] works great and some people will even [33:20] say it seems like it could be [33:21] inconvenient to feed raw it could be a [33:23] pain in the butt I'd give the raw food [33:26] to my dogs frozen I just take it out of [33:28] the bag out of the freezer and I'd give [33:30] it to them frozen it takes them a little [33:32] bit longer to eat it and it's cold so [33:34] the cold speeds up their metabolism [33:36] which keeps them at a nice healthy [33:38] weight so raw I think is the best way to [33:41] go but it can be a little expensive so [33:43] keep that in mind my German Shepherd [33:44] heals beautifully when I have a ball in [33:46] my hand but I'm having a hard time [33:48] weaning that out any suggestions okay [33:50] every single dog starts off as a [33:52] reactive dog we want to teach our dogs [33:55] to be a proactive dog and the way that [33:58] we do that is we teach them that their [33:59] behaviors have an effect on their [34:01] environment what most people do is they [34:03] will take their dog they'll get their [34:05] dog out to train and they will use [34:06] treats and they'll get the dog to [34:08] perform the behaviors and they'll reward [34:09] them well the tricky part is how do we [34:11] get our dogs to do it when the rewards [34:13] are out of sight and there's a very easy [34:14] way to do that and that's by [34:16] implementing the technique known as free [34:18] shaping so all free shaping is you don't [34:21] have anything in mind you want your dog [34:22] to perform but when your dog does [34:25] something that you like you mark and you [34:27] reward it so you have treats on you you [34:29] don't let your dog know that you have [34:30] the treats and you just wait for your [34:32] dog to do something that you like some [34:33] people will make noise to get the dog to [34:36] look at them so you might go bird dog [34:38] looks at you you go yes and you give [34:39] them a piece of food you didn't ask them [34:41] to look at you you simply made a weird [34:43] noise and the dog looked at you and you [34:44] rewarded them for that [34:46] or your dog goes and lays down you want [34:48] you like your dog laying down on their [34:49] bed so you go yes and you go give them a [34:51] treat your dog sits yes and you give [34:53] them a treat you're not asking them to [34:55] perform any of these behaviors but [34:56] you're telling them I like when you do [34:58] that behavior and I'm gonna reward you [35:00] for it even though you didn't see the [35:02] tree and on a long enough time line your [35:04] dog is going to start to realize that [35:06] they can make rewards happen so even [35:08] when you don't have a treat they might [35:10] come up to you and go oh I'm sitting is [35:12] this gonna get a reward and often I'll [35:14] still say yes and I'll walk into the [35:16] kitchen [35:16] and I'll grab one of their treats and [35:18] I'll give them the treat and again even [35:20] though that treat came several seconds [35:22] after the act of the behavior that I was [35:23] capturing my dog knows whatever they [35:25] were doing when they heard that sound is [35:27] what they're getting rewarded for and we [35:29] have as long as it takes to get the [35:31] reward to the dog as long as the dog is [35:33] paying attention to what's going on so [35:35] it could be ten seconds it could be 20 [35:37] seconds it could be even a minute I've [35:39] had it to where my dog did a behavior I [35:41] use the terminal marker I did not have [35:43] my treats on me and I walked into the [35:45] kitchen and I couldn't find the bag of [35:47] treats and I was looking all over for it [35:49] and my dog was following me she's like I [35:50] know you're gonna get me a treat I know [35:52] you're gonna give me a treat you said [35:53] the free I found the bag I opened it up [35:55] I gave her the reward she made the [35:57] connection now if they lose focus they [36:00] get distracted by something and you give [36:02] them so let's say for example you're [36:04] walking towards your dog to give them a [36:05] treat and they see a squirrel they go [36:08] squirrel and they look at the squirrel [36:09] and you reward them now you're rewarding [36:11] them for the squirrel so you have to [36:13] make sure that they maintain that focus [36:14] but going back to the original point do [36:17] the free shaping get your dog to [36:18] understand that they can make rewards [36:20] happen for themselves that creates a [36:22] proactive dog then I would also [36:24] recommend watching the ten fundamental [36:27] steps of a focused heel that I teach [36:30] because at first we are using food we [36:32] are using luring we can use toys to get [36:34] the dog to maintain the position but we [36:36] want to start asking for that behavior [36:38] with the toy out of sight we don't ask [36:39] for a lot of steps in the beginning [36:41] maybe a couple and we have the dog [36:42] looking up at us and we reward them this [36:45] is much easier to understand the concept [36:47] if you watched that video so I recommend [36:49] checking that out and as your dog gets [36:50] better you add more duration and then [36:52] the reward can come out after the dog [36:54] has been performing the behavior [36:55] correctly but it's taken the proper [36:58] steps to get that picture for your dog [36:59] and taking the time to make sure your [37:02] dog masters each step before moving on [37:04] to the next one so again check out that [37:06] video how do you deal with dogs whining [37:07] in the crate okay how do you deal with [37:09] dogs whining in the crate there are a [37:11] few ways to deal with this again think [37:14] about motivation so what some people [37:16] will do is they will ignore the dog or [37:19] the puppy while they're whining the [37:21] moment they stop whining you give it a [37:22] couple seconds then you reward the dog [37:24] and you let them out so you're showing [37:26] them if you win you're gonna stay in the [37:28] crate the dog wants to come out [37:30] usually that's why they're whining so [37:32] you show when you're quiet then I'm [37:34] going to let you out that can work some [37:36] dogs that it's harder to do this [37:38] technique on because they can whine for [37:40] a very very long time before they'll [37:42] even give you five seconds of silence if [37:45] that's the case this is an option that I [37:47] like to use I pick up a metal bowl from [37:50] the pet store if you have one great [37:51] leave it on top of the crate and when [37:54] the dog or the puppy goes to whine you [37:56] say one no you walk over to the crate [37:58] you've grabbed the bowl and go Bing and [37:59] you tap the top of the crate and then [38:01] you walk away if the puppy whines again [38:03] or the dog whines again you say no you [38:05] walk back Bing and then you go to walk [38:07] away again and you do it just like that [38:09] you don't do with any sort of anger or [38:11] aggression in your voice it's a no it's [38:14] simple cause-and-effect you're telling [38:16] the dog if you whine I can't control [38:18] myself I'm gonna walk over and I'm gonna [38:20] take the bowl and I'm gonna hit the top [38:22] of your crate and it's gonna make an [38:24] unpleasant sound that's what you're [38:25] doing you're creating an unpleasant [38:27] sound and that again goes back to [38:29] predictability if the dog starts to [38:31] understand that don't if they whine it [38:33] predicts that you're going to hit the [38:35] top of their crate with a metal bowl [38:36] they quickly stop whining so that is a [38:38] really great technique if you're okay [38:41] hitting the top of the crate with a [38:42] metal bowl don't worry it does not [38:44] traumatize the dog and you're not doing [38:47] it aggressively it's a simple Bing and [38:49] you walk away like I said the other [38:51] option is you wait till they're not [38:52] whining and then you reward them for not [38:54] whining and you don't reward them when [38:56] they're whining I'm having a hard time [38:57] truly understanding when to do the yes [39:00] reward marker or break or free marker [39:02] when training could you please clarify [39:04] okay so our markers are conditioned [39:07] reinforcers I hit on this already a [39:09] little bit in this video every word that [39:12] we use has value based on what it [39:15] predicts or it means to our dog what it [39:18] predicts if I say no to my dog but it [39:21] doesn't predict anything then no means [39:23] nothing to my dog except for a sound if [39:26] I say yes but it doesn't predict [39:28] anything then yes is just another sound [39:30] it's what it predicts so if we're [39:33] looking at this I use yes as my [39:35] continuation marker you can use whatever [39:37] word you like a lot of trainers use yes [39:40] as [39:40] terminal marker but it's important to [39:42] define what these words mean a [39:45] continuation marker is pinpointing a [39:47] moment in time when our dog is correct [39:49] but they have to maintain the position [39:51] this is if you want to reward a dog but [39:54] you also would like them to stay in the [39:56] sit stay for an example you tell the dog [39:58] to sit the moment there but it's the [39:59] ground you go yes you go over and you [40:01] reward them and they have to stay in the [40:03] sit because it is a continuation marker [40:05] it's continuing that specific exercise [40:08] and then free for my dogs is a terminal [40:11] marker a terminal marker is a [40:14] combination of a marker and a release so [40:18] it is telling the dog you're correct you [40:21] are released from this position and you [40:23] can come and access your reward it [40:26] doesn't matter where the dog gets the [40:28] reward in the beginning when I'm [40:30] teaching the terminal marker I say the [40:33] terminal marker and I move away [40:34] encouraging the dog to jump up and get [40:36] the reward I'm showing the dog that it's [40:38] a release and reward by doing this sort [40:40] of motion once the dog knows and [40:43] understands the terminal marker I don't [40:45] have to get the dog to jump up to get [40:46] the reward for example if I'm luring the [40:49] dog into it down I could lure the dog [40:50] into the down the moment they lay down [40:52] free and I release the food I give it to [40:54] them and they can get up they don't have [40:56] to jump up to get the treat I do that in [40:58] the beginning to teach them that it [41:00] means release and reward every single [41:04] time and then my break is simply a [41:06] release you can teach the break the [41:08] exact same way you teach the free you [41:11] can even give them a reward every single [41:13] time if you want and then you can just [41:15] stop giving the rewards now the break in [41:18] the beginning if you're doing it that [41:19] way you're treating it as a terminal [41:21] marker we can quickly reduce the value [41:25] of a marker if we stop rewarding the dog [41:28] that's why I tell people if you say yes [41:30] or you say free to your dog you better [41:32] give them the primary reinforcer because [41:35] it only has value because of what it [41:37] predicts if you start saying yes and [41:39] you're not giving the reward to your dog [41:40] the value is going to quickly decline I [41:44] had a student that kept using their [41:46] continuation marker and they weren't [41:49] rewarding the dog and I said how come [41:50] you're not rewarding your dog is that [41:51] isn't that you [41:52] marker and they said yeah but look how [41:54] happy the dog is and I said yeah the [41:56] dogs happy right now because the dog [41:58] thinks that he's going to get a reward [42:00] but if you keep doing this the value of [42:02] your yes is going to go away entirely [42:04] it's not gonna mean anything we could do [42:06] that with anything let's say for example [42:08] you trained the dog in scent detection [42:09] and you taught the dog to indicate on a [42:12] certain odor and you wanted to remove [42:14] that odor you didn't want to reward the [42:15] dog any more [42:16] well you present that odor to the dog [42:18] and you simply stop rewarding the dog [42:19] and eventually the dog will stop [42:21] indicating on that specific odor so we [42:23] can take away the value that way and the [42:25] reason why I'm saying that is you can [42:26] teach the dog the release and reward by [42:28] using the same concept as a terminal [42:30] marker and then once the dog knows they [42:32] can jump up afterwards and you just stop [42:34] giving them a reward they'll still know [42:36] that break means they're released but [42:38] then they'll quickly learn that it no [42:39] longer means they're going to get a [42:40] reward so it won't have the value of a [42:42] terminal marker but it'll still be a [42:44] very easy way to teach the release what [42:48] I usually don't do though is I just go [42:49] break yeah good puppy and I encourage [42:52] them to come to me and then I pet reward [42:53] them that's how I teach a break it's [42:55] very easy and this actually brings up [42:57] another point because this is something [42:59] that is commonly asked is how do I get [43:01] my dog to know their name and some [43:03] videos will tell you to have a treat say [43:07] your dog's name and give them a treat [43:08] say your dog's name and give them a [43:10] treat I don't recommend doing this [43:13] number one is you're turning the name [43:15] into a conditioned reinforcer and then [43:18] number two if it is a conditioned [43:20] reinforcer let's say for example you did [43:23] this exercise with your dog and now your [43:26] dog is conditioned to their name meaning [43:28] when they hear their name they think [43:29] they're going to get a reward and they [43:31] think that when they hear their name [43:32] whatever they're doing in that moment in [43:33] time is something that you'd like so [43:35] let's say your dog is in the backyard [43:37] you can't see your dog you're looking [43:38] for them but they're digging they're [43:40] digging a hole and you go hey Fido Fido [43:43] goes all there's there's a sound that [43:45] means I'm going to get a treat and Fido [43:47] comes running over and you give Fido a [43:49] tree you just rewarded your dog for [43:51] digging so that's another reason why I [43:53] don't recommend taking the dogs name and [43:56] then giving them a reward instead of [43:59] what should I do to get my dog to [44:00] understand their name what's more [44:01] important is what you shouldn't [44:03] do you shouldn't use your dog's name as [44:06] a sound when you're upset at them so it [44:09] shouldn't be Fido [44:10] get over here Fido no fight Oh bad fight [44:12] oh this always make their name positive [44:15] by not necessarily having it predict a [44:18] treat but for any situation so if I call [44:22] my dog already good girl [44:23] ari is a good girl or Charlie good boy [44:25] buddy really nice charlie and I'm [44:27] rewarding them and I'm saying their name [44:28] that's going to be a great way to do it [44:30] but I do not want to treat it as a [44:33] conditioned reinforcer because I don't [44:35] want to say their name and market [44:36] behavior I don't want them to perform by [44:38] accident okay [44:40] so that's going to be our markers we [44:42] also have a non reinforcement marker and [44:45] that's for mistakes so if my dog makes a [44:48] mistake if I tell them to sit and they [44:49] lay down instead I say wrong that means [44:52] that's incorrect you're not going to get [44:53] a reward but I'm gonna let you try it [44:55] again [44:55] so just to recap on the markers [44:58] continuation marker it simply means [45:00] they're correct but they have to [45:01] maintain the position that's why it's [45:03] called a continuation marker the [45:05] terminal marker is terminating the [45:06] exercise and it's predicting a reward so [45:08] it's inherently or it's essentially a [45:11] release and reward and then our break is [45:15] just a release word and then our non [45:17] reinforcement marker just lets a dog [45:18] know they made a mistake and they're not [45:20] gonna get the treat but they could try [45:21] again how can I stop my dog from barking [45:23] at other dogs and people went outside or [45:25] on a walk it's not alerting or [45:26] aggressive bark it's more like wanting [45:28] to visit and play but it gets annoying [45:30] okay I've talked about this before in [45:32] some of my other videos you want to use [45:34] the concept of counter conditioning or [45:37] desensitizing the dog my favorite way to [45:40] do this is I like to take the dog to a [45:43] local dog park but I do not take the dog [45:45] into the dog park I get far enough where [45:47] my dog can see the other dogs but not [45:50] close enough to where my dog can engage [45:51] with them and then I just do obedience I [45:53] get my dog to understand that they need [45:55] to work when there's other dogs or those [45:57] distractions now this is going to be a [45:59] little bit down the road after my dog [46:00] already knows the obedience has fun [46:02] training understands the commands and [46:04] knows leash pressure etc then I'm gonna [46:06] take the dog there and I'm gonna start [46:08] healing with my dog I'm gonna do sit [46:10] stays down stays with the park in the [46:12] background pretty far away as my dog [46:14] gets better I'm going to [46:16] start moving the training overtime maybe [46:19] over a couple weeks maybe over a couple [46:21] months it depends on the dog and I'm [46:22] gonna move closer and closer to the dog [46:26] park where the dogs are and where the [46:27] people are walking back and forth until [46:29] my dog understands that it's no longer a [46:32] big deal there's no need to bark at them [46:34] because that's not gonna get access to [46:36] the dogs and it's gonna be better to be [46:38] training and working with you so again [46:40] we're using the concept of desensitizing [46:42] the dog by exposing them to it [46:45] over and over and over and over again to [46:47] where it's not a big deal and then [46:49] counter conditioning so counter [46:51] conditioning all counter conditioning [46:52] really is it's taking something that the [46:55] dog may have one perspective of like [46:58] they may feel a certain way about it and [46:59] you change the way they feel about it by [47:01] making it predict something pleasant so [47:03] you make it predict fun you make it [47:05] predict play you make it predict a [47:07] reward or something like that that's [47:09] kind of what counter conditioning really [47:11] is simply put or reconditioning is also [47:14] what it's called and that's going to [47:16] help a great deal and if you're doing [47:18] this and you're getting your seen [47:20] results and then you go back to your [47:22] neighborhood and you're walking your dog [47:23] and your dog still starts to bark at [47:25] other dogs after you've done all that [47:27] other training it's because your dogs [47:28] not generalized yet your dog thinks that [47:31] it's not okay to do those behaviors when [47:33] you're outside of the park and you see [47:35] all those other dogs walking back and [47:36] forth but it is still okay to do it in [47:39] the neighborhood if that's the case then [47:41] you basically have to do the same [47:42] exercise in the neighborhood but by [47:46] keeping distance again that's going to [47:49] make it easier for your dog to [47:51] understand what's going on and then you [47:52] move closer and closer to what they [47:54] become reactive to so sometimes you may [47:56] have somebody help you with this [47:57] somebody you know who has a dog that is [47:59] really chill and relaxed or sometimes [48:02] there might be a neighbor that has a dog [48:04] that barks at people walking by and you [48:07] can use that as a distraction but really [48:10] if we're gonna simplify it desensitize [48:12] them by exposing them over and over [48:14] again and doing the obedience and [48:17] getting the dog closer and closer to the [48:18] as they become better at it and if it [48:21] they still continue to bark or they [48:22] still continue to act out this is when a [48:24] lot of people would give the dog a [48:25] correction [48:26] so they're telling the dog I've shown [48:28] you what you're supposed to do I've [48:29] given you a very clear path to success [48:31] I've taught you how to turn out pressure [48:33] by compliant you're still acting out [48:35] this behavior so now you're going to [48:37] receive a correction for it and that's [48:39] very fair and a correction again is just [48:41] a leash pop so that's what a lot of [48:43] people will do and then the dog will [48:45] quickly realize okay barking up these [48:46] other dogs barking at these other people [48:48] that's not a fun experience I'm going to [48:50] direct my attention back on to you and [48:52] then you would reward them for that is [48:54] it bad to give my dog too much freedom [48:55] in the house she opens the door by [48:57] herself enters and leaves when she wants [48:59] to [48:59] she's also stubborn and will only listen [49:01] if I have food lastly she winds if I [49:03] don't reward her right away while [49:05] training okay so given a dog freedom in [49:08] the house Bethany said it best in the [49:10] podcast that I did with her she said [49:12] it's not a problem unless it's a problem [49:14] and I completely agree with that [49:16] this goes to anything were allowing our [49:18] dogs to do so for example I allow my [49:21] dogs to sit on the couch I allow my dogs [49:23] to sleep on my bed with me they hang out [49:25] pretty much everywhere I go and like I [49:27] said it's not a problem unless it's a [49:29] problem if I have a dog and I allow that [49:31] dog onto my couch and then I tell my dog [49:34] to get off the couch and the dog growls [49:35] at me the dog starts to resource guard [49:38] the couch now it's a problem and now I'm [49:40] not going to allow my dog to be on the [49:42] couch I'm going to correct that behavior [49:43] because that's not an OK behavior and [49:45] I'm gonna adjust accordingly so a dog [49:48] having freedom in the house my dogs have [49:49] total freedom in the house they can do [49:51] whatever they want and it doesn't make [49:53] them think that they're the Alpha over [49:54] me or any of that other nonsense that [49:56] you might hear they're completely fine [49:58] because they know when I do give them a [50:00] certain command I make sure I follow [50:02] through and they do that command when I [50:04] leave to go to the park I use the climb [50:06] command and they'll stay on my porch [50:08] until I open my door to my truck and [50:10] then I'll release them and they'll run [50:12] and jump in the truck they're very [50:13] obedient so by allowing them on the [50:15] furniture that's not going to make [50:17] that's not gonna ruin the training and [50:19] it's not ruining my training it's the [50:21] same with everyone else's dogs if you [50:23] start to realize that you're giving your [50:25] dog too much freedom and your dog starts [50:27] to act out in a way that you don't [50:28] approve of then you can start taking [50:30] some of those privileges away and you [50:34] also said that your dog only listens [50:37] when you have food this goes back to [50:38] what I was talking about [50:39] earlier in the video about free shaping [50:42] you need to do free shaping with your [50:43] dog you need to get your dog to [50:44] understand that concept of being [50:46] proactive and that's by simply rewarding [50:48] your dog when your dog is doing [50:49] behaviors that you like when you're not [50:51] asking them to do them so your dog sits [50:53] because your dog wants to sit you mark [50:55] you reward that behavior on a long [50:57] enough timeline that will create a [50:59] proactive dog a dog that will actively [51:01] start working you to make rewards they [51:03] don't see magically appear and that's [51:05] one of the best ways to create a [51:07] proactive dog and then your dog is going [51:09] to start doing behaviors whether or not [51:11] you have a reward in sight she wins if I [51:14] don't reward her right away while [51:15] training okay so that right there is [51:17] almost telling me that you are rewarding [51:19] her while she's whining them don't [51:21] reward her do not give her a treat when [51:23] she's whining because if you're giving [51:25] her a reward while she's whining to stop [51:28] her from whining you are rewarding that [51:30] behavior you're rewarding a bad behavior [51:32] do not reward bad behaviors here's [51:34] another example of rewarding a bad [51:36] behavior if we're talking about the dog [51:38] being on the couch if I walk over to a [51:40] dog that's on a couch and I asked them [51:42] to come off the couch and they growl at [51:43] me and I go oh you growled at me that's [51:45] pretty scary I'm gonna leave you on the [51:46] couch I just taught that dog that they [51:49] need to growl to get people to go away [51:50] and leave them on the couch so we never [51:52] want to enforce bad behaviors and if if [51:56] a dog is whining and I reward them for [51:58] whining I'm rewarding that whining the [52:00] dogs going to continue to do it so I [52:02] would wait till the dog stops whining [52:03] once the dog stops whining then I reward [52:06] the dog definitely don't ever reward a [52:09] dog for doing a behavior you don't like [52:11] to get them to stop that behavior that's [52:12] only gonna make it worse and they're [52:14] gonna keep doing that behavior because [52:16] they know that it gets them a reward can [52:18] you address some age specific [52:19] expectations concerning the recall and [52:21] duration of skills and different [52:23] environments I don't worry too much [52:24] about the age I look at every dog as an [52:27] individual and I just according to that [52:28] dog but it does make it a little bit [52:30] more difficult if this is the second [52:32] maybe third dog you've ever had or [52:34] you've ever trained or ever worked with [52:35] you don't have a very large frame of [52:38] reference most dog trainers have trained [52:40] dozens of dogs some have trained [52:42] hundreds of dogs so they have a really [52:44] huge frame of reference and they know [52:46] how long it should take based on what [52:48] they're seen from the very beginning [52:49] working with the dog I can work with a [52:51] dog one day [52:52] and I can have a great idea of how fast [52:54] that dog was going to learn how long [52:56] it's going to take the teacher to stay [52:58] how long it's going to take to teach it [52:59] more advanced behaviors because I've [53:01] seen it dozens of times before but for a [53:05] lot of people they don't have that and [53:07] what I recommend doing is filming [53:09] yourself while you're training film [53:12] yourself while you're training to make [53:13] sure you're not pairing your markers to [53:15] make sure you're not pairing the [53:16] physical with the verbal when you're [53:17] teaching a verbal command look at [53:19] yourself and look at all the mistakes [53:21] you're making you're going to be your [53:22] own worst critic if your watch the [53:25] videos and you start to realize you're [53:26] making all these mistakes then you have [53:28] to adjust your training but if you're [53:30] training and you're watching the video [53:32] and you're doing it beautifully your [53:33] markers are great your timing is great [53:35] your delivery is great then it could [53:38] just be the dog some dogs simply take [53:40] longer to learn than others but with my [53:43] own personal dogs I never worry about [53:45] how long something is going to take [53:47] because I like to train my dogs all the [53:49] time I think it's something that [53:50] everybody should do you should train [53:53] your dog as much as possible even into [53:55] their senior years because it's fun for [53:58] them it stimulates the mind it's a way [54:01] for them to engage with you it builds [54:03] that relationship it makes everything [54:04] better [54:05] so with my own dogs I don't worry about [54:07] I don't worry about how quickly they're [54:09] gonna learn the stand command when I say [54:11] stand I don't worry I just do it I keep [54:13] doing the exercise until my dog starts [54:15] to do it and I'm like awesome my dog has [54:16] it great and then I keep training and I [54:19] have fun with it so don't stress [54:20] yourself out too much expecting too much [54:23] from your dog train have a good time [54:25] have fun and you will start to see [54:27] results film yourself to make sure [54:29] you're not making a lot of common [54:31] mistakes what would you recommend for [54:33] socializing during the pandemic and how [54:35] would you go about introducing a puppy [54:37] to existing animals specifically cats so [54:40] socializing during the pandemic that is [54:42] difficult unless you know people you [54:44] have friends that you trust and you can [54:46] go to their place and they have dogs [54:48] when it comes to socializing a dog or a [54:50] puppy what I'm more concerned about is [54:52] exposure exposing the dog to lots of [54:55] different environments exposing the dog [54:57] to lots of different people exposing the [54:59] dog to lots of different dogs but not [55:01] necess [55:01] having the dog interact with a bunch of [55:03] people or in Iraq with a bunch of dogs I [55:05] want them to see them but realize that [55:07] they're not a big deal [55:08] they don't have to go say hi to every [55:10] single person or every single dog this [55:12] is why a lot of times when somebody is [55:15] working or training a service dog the [55:16] vest says do not pet this dog is working [55:19] because when you're training a service [55:21] dog that dog needs to be focused on the [55:23] handler that dog cannot be looking for [55:25] rewards from every single person that [55:27] walks by [55:28] so it's exposure and then when I am [55:30] introducing my dog to a human or another [55:33] dog I want to make sure the human knows [55:35] how to properly communicate with a dog [55:38] I'm gonna get one of my more dog savvy [55:40] friends I'm not going to have my dog [55:42] socialize with one of my friends who are [55:44] awkward and they never been around a dog [55:46] and they don't know how to act around a [55:48] dog because that's not going to help the [55:49] development I'm gonna have one of my [55:51] friends who's not gonna reward my dog [55:52] for jumping up on them who is going to [55:54] understand not to put too much pressure [55:57] maybe on the dog of the young puppy or [55:59] knows how to play with the dog etc we [56:01] want to have the dog have a positive [56:03] experience every single new experience [56:05] should be positive so if you have [56:06] friends that are willing to do that [56:08] that's a great way to socialize your dog [56:09] with other people and then with other [56:11] dogs I like to find dogs that are not [56:14] going to try to be dominant over the [56:15] puppy I never want an adult dog to make [56:18] a young puppy submissive contrary to [56:21] popular belief it's not about having a [56:23] submissive dog but rather having a [56:24] confident dog so I never let an older [56:27] dog make a young puppy become submissive [56:29] I don't want that to be the default [56:31] behavior if my dog doesn't know what to [56:33] do - just lay over on its side and [56:34] become submissive that's not a good [56:36] behavior - try to teach your dog so I'm [56:38] going to have a dog that will allow the [56:40] puppy to play with them and they're [56:42] going to be a great experience for the [56:45] dog and it's not going to teach the [56:46] puppy to become submissive so finding [56:49] the right dogs of course I don't want my [56:51] puppy to interact with the dog that's [56:53] going to be aggressive or a dog that [56:54] might bite or snap at the puppy because [56:56] then that could be a very terrible [56:58] experience that could go on with the [57:00] puppy for life and now you have a dog [57:02] that grows up and is fearful of other [57:04] dogs cautious around other dogs or [57:06] whatever so you really want to control [57:08] all the social interactions and then the [57:12] next part is how would you go about [57:13] introducing a puppy to existing [57:15] animals specifically cats that is a [57:19] interesting question because there are [57:21] so many different variables it depends [57:24] on how the cat is some cats are great [57:27] with dogs and the puppy can play with [57:29] the cat and they become best friends [57:30] some cats are going to hate that a dog [57:33] is entering the house and the dog or the [57:36] cat might avoid the dog or whatever so [57:39] it's going to depend on a lot in this [57:41] situation is how the cat reacts to the [57:43] dog if the cat wants to meet the dog and [57:46] it's a friendly nice cat then I'm gonna [57:48] let them interact as long as the cat [57:49] doesn't become aggressive towards the [57:51] puppy that's a great time to introduce [57:54] them again knowing how the cat is going [57:56] to be I don't want the cat to become [57:59] aggressive towards the puppy because [58:00] again that's going to be another bad [58:01] experience if you're worried about that [58:04] then I would just use the whole concept [58:06] of positive association dog sees the cat [58:09] I get the dog's attention I reward the [58:11] dog or the puppy the puppy sees the cat [58:14] I get the puppy's attention I reward the [58:16] puppy so then I'm showing the puppy that [58:17] oh look at the cat there it is if you [58:20] look at me I'm gonna give you a reward [58:21] now I've created a positive association [58:24] to the cat and hopefully everything is [58:26] great and smooth if I start to see signs [58:29] of aggression towards the cat then I [58:31] correct that I don't tolerate aggression [58:34] towards a cat in the house because [58:35] especially if the dog gets older a dog [58:38] can potentially kill a cat and I've seen [58:41] it before it's not fun so if I do start [58:44] to see any sort of aggression coming [58:46] from a dog or a puppy that I'm raising [58:48] towards a cat then I correct it I use a [58:50] physical correction because again this [58:52] is for the safety of the cat I do not [58:55] want the dog to think it's okay to be [58:56] aggressive towards a cat so that's going [58:58] to be the steps that I'm gonna take when [58:59] it comes to introducing a puppy to a cat [59:01] it's gonna depend on the cat if the cat [59:03] is interested in the dog if the cat is [59:05] friendly I'll let them interact and [59:07] hopefully they become best friends if [59:09] the cats aggressive towards a dog or if [59:11] the dog becomes aggressive towards the [59:13] cat then I'm gonna correct the dog or if [59:15] the cat is aggressive towards a dog then [59:17] I'm gonna keep the dog away from the cat [59:18] okay I'm still trying to get my dog to [59:20] let me pet her head how should I proceed [59:22] from here how should I convert value to [59:25] be in pet and [59:26] / enjoy it okay if you have a dog that [59:28] is a little cautious with being pet then [59:31] I'm going to use the same concept I [59:34] would for any other behavior that I want [59:37] the dog to repeat I'm gonna treat it as [59:40] a behavior that I'm rewarding no [59:42] different from a sit or no different [59:43] from a down so I'm gonna get the dog to [59:46] first look at me and I'm gonna reward [59:47] that without touching the dog's head [59:49] then I'm gonna slowly start bringing my [59:51] hand closer to the dog as long as the [59:53] dog maintains focus on me I'm gonna [59:54] reward and I'm gonna keep doing that I'm [59:56] gonna get my hand closer and closer and [59:57] closer and closer up until the point [59:59] where I can actually touch the dog then [60:01] the dogs looking at me I give the dog a [60:03] little pet yes reward the dogs looking [60:05] at me I pet them a little bit yes reward [60:07] the dogs looking at me I pet them a [60:09] little bit more [60:10] yes reward then I'm treating or I'm [60:12] showing the dog that this is something I [60:14] want you to do its pleasant and you're [60:16] going to get a reward for it this could [60:17] take a little bit of time depending on [60:19] if the dog may have had a bad experience [60:21] in the past so you're going to have to [60:23] be patient with it but using positive [60:25] association is going to be the best way [60:27] in my opinion to get your dog [60:29] comfortable being pet and you're taking [60:31] the time to do it correctly and still [60:33] getting that engagement from your dog [60:34] having them look up at you and like I [60:36] said slowly getting to the point where [60:39] you're able to pet them and then reward [60:40] them for that don't expect a long pet in [60:42] the very beginning make it short and [60:44] sweet build your dog up through success [60:46] the more success they have the more [60:48] confidence they have and the easier the [60:50] exercise will become I have a nine week [60:52] old Dutch Shepherd and it's very [60:54] determined to nip fingers toes ankles [60:56] pants legs etc the cuteness wore off [60:59] pretty quickly [60:59] I've tried yet being like a hurt puppy [61:02] which worked for a little while saying [61:03] no has no effect rewarding him when he's [61:06] laying nicely doesn't seem to register [61:08] with him that nipping isn't allowed it's [61:10] pretty frustrating hope you can offer a [61:12] good approach thank you okay again when [61:14] we're looking at a dog doing a behavior [61:16] we have to think about what is [61:17] motivating them to do that behavior [61:20] there's a few techniques few known [61:22] common techniques to stop puppy biting [61:25] I'm actually gonna put a video up just [61:27] on this and I'm gonna demonstrate with [61:29] the puppy but the first one is to [61:31] redirect the dog to something that they [61:33] are allowed to bite now puppy biting [61:36] from my experience they grow out of it [61:38] it's the same as a child stuff [61:40] their thumb most kids will grow out of [61:42] it every now and then you might have one [61:44] that continues to do it but eventually [61:45] everybody grows out of it it's the same [61:48] with our dogs puppy biting is a part of [61:50] their development they're exploring the [61:52] world and that's how they do it they do [61:53] it with their mouths and with their [61:55] teeth so we can redirect them to a [61:57] different toy now look at the activity [62:00] and why the dog is doing it if the dog [62:01] is biting you because it's fun and [62:03] that's part of the reason why puppies [62:05] bite especially Dutch shepherds and [62:08] Malin waz they want to bite everything [62:10] and this is why a lot of protection dog [62:12] trainers that's their go-to breed for [62:15] protection training because it's easy to [62:18] build upon that but if the dog continues [62:20] to do it we redirect it it's not [62:22] removing the value of the dog biting [62:25] your leg or your arms it's just giving [62:27] your puppy a different option and [62:29] eventually they're gonna grow out of it [62:31] it's not like I said it's not stopping [62:33] it because let's say your arm for [62:35] example is a toy - your dog your dog [62:37] sees your arm as a toy yeah this toy is [62:39] fun to bite and then you give it [62:41] something else that you would rather the [62:43] puppy bite puppy's gonna go oh this is a [62:45] fun toy and if that toy goes away your [62:47] puppy's gonna go oh there's the other [62:49] toy and go back to biting your arm again [62:51] it doesn't stop the behavior of biting [62:53] your arm or your pants or anything it [62:55] just gives the puppy a different option [62:57] and you wait till they grow out of it [62:59] this is an excellent option if you don't [63:01] mind constantly redirecting your dog to [63:04] a new toy I never corrected my dogs for [63:07] biting when they're puppies and they [63:09] always grow out of it however there are [63:11] three other techniques if you do want to [63:13] remove it entirely one is neutralizing [63:16] it I've talked about this before [63:18] neutralizing is simply making it no [63:20] longer a fun experience so if my puppy [63:23] goes to bite my hand I grab their lower [63:25] jaw so I grab the soft tissue underneath [63:27] the chin and the soft tissue inside they [63:31] go to bite and I grab it just like that [63:34] and I hold it until the puppy pulls away [63:37] I'm not squeezing I'm not pinching hard [63:39] I'm not trying to make it hurt I'm just [63:41] holding the dog so I hold the puppy and [63:43] the puppy's like this isn't fun I need [63:45] to get away and they pull away that's [63:47] going to usually get most dogs or most [63:50] puppies to stop biting [63:51] we are neutralizing the experience we [63:53] are saying [63:54] it's no longer fun it's not painful but [63:56] it's not fun another option this is not [63:58] my preferred go-to technique but a lot [64:01] of people use it the puppy will go to [64:02] bite and they will push the puppy's lip [64:04] on their own teeth I don't like to do [64:06] this because I don't want to cut the [64:07] inside of my puppy's mouth I don't want [64:09] them to feel pain with this because [64:11] they're just exploring their world and I [64:13] want every experience to be positive I [64:15] want every experience to be fun so I [64:18] don't like using this option but what it [64:20] does is it takes the experience and it [64:22] turns it from being a fun experience [64:24] into a negative experience so then they [64:27] stop doing it this would be the same as [64:29] if a puppy bit of cactus ouch the cactus [64:31] hurt I'm not gonna bite the cactus [64:33] anymore puppy goes to bite your hand [64:35] ouch that hurt I'm not gonna bite your [64:37] hand again and then the last option is [64:39] you have a leash you have a collar on [64:41] the puppy puppy goes to bite you go know [64:43] and you pop the leash the moment the [64:45] puppy stops biting you go yay good puppy [64:48] so then you're showing the puppy I don't [64:49] want you to bite my hand if you bite my [64:51] hand there's gonna be a consequence when [64:52] you stop I'm gonna quickly reward you [64:54] for it so it would look exactly like [64:56] this no correction yeah a good puppy [65:00] that quick it's that fast so those are [65:02] gonna be the main ways to dealing with [65:04] puppy biting and if you need to correct [65:07] it then those options I like the [65:10] grabbing option it's the nicest it [65:12] neutralizes it it doesn't cause any pain [65:14] for the puppy if I want to stop it and [65:16] that's not working my next option is [65:18] popping the leash but my go-to my [65:22] preferred every single time is to let [65:24] the puppy grow out of it I enjoy it when [65:26] I have a puppy when I'm raising a puppy [65:28] everybody knows because my arm has [65:31] scratches all over it because I let them [65:33] play I have fun with it it doesn't [65:35] bother me and if you don't mind [65:37] redirecting it to another toy that's [65:39] also an excellent option and a great way [65:42] to help your dog through those [65:44] developing stages okay three year old [65:46] terrier mix just recently started [65:47] obsessively digging to chase moles I'm [65:49] never able to catch her in the act [65:51] therefore I am NOT able to redirect I [65:53] have tried setting her up to fail so I [65:55] can redirect and reward but she is smart [65:56] enough to not do it in front of me [65:58] suggestions when it comes to digging [66:00] you're exactly right you either have to [66:02] set the dog up to fail so you can [66:06] from the moment they make the wrong [66:07] choice and you can show what it is that [66:09] you want them to do if you're unable to [66:11] catch them in the act then you do have a [66:14] couple other options some people will [66:16] try to show their dog an area in the [66:18] yard that they are allowed to dig so [66:20] then they have a location as an outlet [66:22] some people will say you need to [66:23] exercise your dog more if your dogs not [66:26] getting enough physical and mental [66:28] stimulation throughout the day then [66:29] they're gonna find other means to be [66:31] able to satisfy those needs and often [66:33] digging can be one of those options but [66:35] let's say your dog is getting plenty of [66:37] physical exercise they are mentally [66:39] stimulated you're doing all the things [66:40] you're supposed to be doing and yet your [66:42] dog is still digging in the yard well [66:44] digging can be in fun activity this is [66:46] known as a self rewarding or self [66:49] reinforcing behavior if that's the case [66:51] you have to catch the dog in the act you [66:53] have to redirect them to what it is that [66:55] you would prefer them to do or you can [66:57] also create a deterrent what some people [67:00] will do is they will they have different [67:02] sprays and things like that that you can [67:03] buy that you could spray in the yard [67:05] that is supposed to create some sort of [67:08] like a citrus or something that the dog [67:10] doesn't like and so they stop digging [67:11] that creates a deterrent so the dog [67:13] hopefully won't dig even when you're not [67:15] there because it's no longer fun because [67:17] of the spray another option is like I [67:20] said you have to catch them in the act [67:21] if you can't catch him in the act or if [67:23] you're saying that's because when you're [67:24] out in the yard your dog's not gonna do [67:26] it then what some people will do and I'm [67:28] not telling anybody to do this but this [67:29] is what some trainers what some people [67:31] will choose to do and you can get [67:33] results from it so it depends on you [67:35] know how far you want to go in order to [67:37] fix this behavior but using a remote [67:39] training collar some people will get a [67:41] remote training collar they will place [67:43] it on the dog they will set a camera up [67:44] often they'll FaceTime so using their [67:47] spouses phone or something like that [67:49] that way you could be inside you can [67:51] watch your dog the moment the dog starts [67:53] to dig you give the dog a correction the [67:56] dog comes running inside you go what [67:57] happened to the dirt bite you did that [68:00] bad dirt bite you and then hopefully the [68:02] dog stops digging because you created a [68:04] negative association with digging so [68:07] those are going to be your main options [68:09] you create or you do more exercise with [68:11] your dog so hopefully you're giving them [68:13] that needed stimulation so they don't [68:14] dig you create a deterrent by using one [68:17] of those products that they sell that [68:18] you can spray [68:19] in the yard you give your dog a [68:21] different location in the yard where [68:23] they're allowed to dig I don't recommend [68:24] that option but anyways it's something [68:27] that some people do same thing with the [68:29] remote collar or using a leash and a [68:32] long line and catching the dog in the [68:34] act or redirecting them to something [68:35] else you want to do those are going to [68:37] be the ways to fix it there's no magic [68:39] trick to do it you just have to make [68:41] sure you catch the dog in the act and [68:42] you show them exactly what it is that [68:43] you want them to do my 9 month old [68:45] German Shepherd does good on leash walks [68:47] with me but when I try to walk him with [68:48] my kids he pulls and starts barking and [68:50] excitement how do I stop this behavior [68:52] this goes with anything as you start [68:54] adding new distractions you want to do [68:56] it slowly and you don't want to add a [68:58] bunch of distractions all at one time so [69:00] having the entire family that each [69:02] individual becomes a new distraction and [69:04] it's a new experience for the dog so [69:06] could be exciting so what I would do in [69:08] that situation is I would have everybody [69:10] in the family work with the dog in a [69:12] neutral environment so inside the house [69:14] in the living room in the backyard [69:15] wherever it is you train your dog and [69:17] I'm having each family member work with [69:19] the dog and then I'm gonna have the [69:20] family come together and work with the [69:22] dog so now the dog being with the entire [69:24] family and working with the entire [69:25] family as a normal experience then we're [69:28] gonna take it outside and we're gonna go [69:30] on the walk so if you take those steps [69:32] and you have everybody work with the dog [69:34] then it doesn't become this really crazy [69:36] really exciting new experience and [69:38] you're gonna have control or better [69:39] control the situation then if you just [69:42] try to have the dog jump right into this [69:44] new situation without getting the dog [69:46] exposed to each individual experience in [69:50] a more neutral environment so doing it [69:52] again inside the house where it's more [69:54] neutral one person at a time then bring [69:56] everybody together then even have one [69:59] person at a time go on the walk so maybe [70:01] you and one other person than you and [70:03] the next one if you have a bunch of kids [70:05] one kid at a time and then your spouse [70:06] and then bring the kids and then so it's [70:09] a process it could take a little bit of [70:11] time but it's worth doing and it creates [70:13] a great learning experience for the dog [70:14] and usually the family enjoys it as well [70:17] so that would be how I would deal with [70:18] that situation how do I train my dog for [70:21] public access when it comes to training [70:23] a service dog anytime I'm training a [70:25] service dog first I always start with [70:28] basic obedience this is why it took so [70:30] long for me to release episode [70:32] two of the service dog training in my [70:35] service dog series because the first one [70:37] was basically all obedience and I've [70:40] been working obedience so I really like [70:41] to get the dog to understand obedience [70:43] first I want the dog to like training I [70:45] want to make training as fun as possible [70:47] the same thing I do with any other dog [70:49] because I want them to enjoy work and [70:51] the more they enjoy it the better they [70:53] become at it and the faster they learn [70:54] then once I have all those communication [70:56] channels down my dog knows how to work [70:58] with me we've built a great relationship [70:59] that I'm gonna start teaching the dog [71:01] those specific tasks that they're gonna [71:03] have to perform to be a service dog then [71:05] I'm gonna start taking the dog out into [71:07] public when I take a service dog in [71:08] training into public I have a vest on [71:10] the dog that says service dog in [71:12] training now a service dog in training [71:14] does not have the same public access [71:16] that an actual service dog does but most [71:19] places will allow you to train that dog [71:21] to be a service dog because they [71:23] understand in order to train a dog to be [71:24] a service dog you have to take that dog [71:26] out into public and get it used to being [71:28] exposed to all these different [71:29] environments now there are places that [71:32] you can take the dog regardless of them [71:34] training or being a service dog [71:36] is places like Lowe's Home Depot Pet [71:39] Smart Petco all those places allow any [71:41] sort of dog to come into it as long as [71:43] the dog is not being aggressive [71:44] attacking other you know dogs or people [71:47] or you know going to the bathroom inside [71:49] as long as it's a decently behaved dog [71:51] you can take your dog to any one of [71:53] those environments now I take my dogs [71:55] that I'm training to be service dogs I'd [71:56] like to take them to the mall because [71:58] there's a lot of traffic in the mall and [71:59] I want my dog to get used to or the dog [72:01] that I'm training rather to be a service [72:03] dog I want them to get used to seeing [72:04] different people seeing different [72:06] environments and again the training vest [72:08] says in training so if somebody comes up [72:10] to me and they say is that a service dog [72:12] I say no it's not a service dog but I'm [72:14] training it to be a service dog and it's [72:16] very clear that I'm training the dog to [72:18] be a service dog I'm not trying to take [72:20] advantage of the system anytime I take a [72:22] service dog out then I'm training I have [72:24] my training vest on I'm working with the [72:26] dog and you can tell the only thing that [72:28] I'm focused on is that dog in that [72:30] learning experience I'm not just taking [72:32] my dog to the store or doing something [72:35] like that and trying to take advantage [72:36] of the system because too many people [72:38] are doing that and they should not be [72:39] doing it because it's gonna cause [72:40] problems to those that actually have to [72:43] take their dogs out [72:44] public so I'm gonna do that and then if [72:46] the business does tell you to leave if [72:49] you're training the service dog you have [72:51] to leave and I've had that happen a [72:53] couple times I'm training the dog in the [72:54] location they come up to me they say [72:56] it's a service dog I say no it's not [72:57] it's in training and I'm training and [72:59] they go sorry you can't be here and I [73:01] say no problem and I leave because they [73:03] have the right to kick me out if I'm [73:05] trying to train a dog in their business [73:07] location that is not a service dog but [73:09] like I said most places allow me to [73:11] train the service dog in the location [73:13] and I've never really had any issues so [73:15] that's the way that I would do it and [73:17] then once the dog is trained to be a [73:19] service dog then they have full public [73:21] access you don't have to have any sort [73:23] of certification for a dog to be a [73:25] service dog the a da has a page on [73:27] frequently asked questions and one of [73:29] those is how do I make my dog a service [73:31] dog get a note from your doctor that [73:32] will say the quality of your life will [73:34] improve by having a service dog that dog [73:36] is trained to perform specific tasks [73:38] that help you with that disability then [73:41] it's a service dog you know make sure [73:43] it's well trained make sure it's [73:44] obedient make sure it listens you know [73:46] don't have that service dog out in [73:48] public that pulls on the leash you know [73:49] that clearly hasn't had the training [73:51] that it needs in order to be a service [73:52] dog and that's gonna be the best way to [73:54] do it how long should I wait in between [73:56] bringing the puppy home and service [73:58] training what's the indicator that the [74:00] dog is ready to begin service training [74:02] once I bring a puppy home it doesn't [74:04] matter if this dog is for basic [74:05] obedience if it's gonna be for a pet if [74:07] it's gonna be a service dog if it's [74:08] gonna be a protection trained sport [74:10] competition it doesn't matter right away [74:13] we start training the imprinting stages [74:15] for our dog is between the first 16 [74:17] weeks of their life so what they learned [74:19] during that time sticks with them for [74:21] life it is the most important time so [74:24] every single experience during this time [74:26] should be pleasant it should be fun the [74:29] training should be fun you should get [74:31] the dog to really enjoy it I know I've [74:32] talked about that throughout this entire [74:34] video but really getting the dog to [74:36] understand and love and enjoy the [74:38] training is one of the best things to do [74:40] so if you're if you have a dog and you [74:42] want that dog to be a service dog start [74:43] training it right away start socializing [74:45] it right away start working with it [74:47] right away and develop it to really [74:49] enjoy it and it'll learn very fast and [74:52] you'll have an excellent service dog [74:53] when they get older how do I increase my [74:55] dog's ball Drive one of the best wages [74:57] to [74:58] increase a dog's toy drive is by doing [74:59] an exercise called drive building so [75:02] drive building what you do is you take [75:04] your dog you place your dog on a harness [75:05] or an agitation collar and agitation [75:08] collar is just a really really thick [75:09] collar that they can pull on I prefer [75:11] the harness though you hook them up to a [75:13] back tie and you tease them with their [75:15] toy so if you're using a ball I would do [75:17] a ball on a rope and I would tease the [75:19] dog with the ball when the dog when the [75:21] dog gets really excited really wants it [75:22] I'm gonna reward the dog with the ball [75:24] and then I'm gonna keep it active by [75:26] moving the ball by using the rope that [75:30] it's attached to I'm gonna make it fun [75:31] I'm gonna make it more engages the dog [75:33] let's go I'm gonna tease it a little bit [75:34] more I'm gonna go back and forth the dog [75:36] shows excitement interest then I'm gonna [75:38] reward the dog again and this will [75:40] usually increase the dog's ball drive [75:42] I'll be making a video entirely on this [75:45] in the future so be on the lookout for [75:47] that this is what a lot of scent [75:49] detection dog trainers will do because [75:51] they want to build that toy drive and [75:52] use it during training this is something [75:54] that protection trainers do all the time [75:57] they teach the dog to really enjoy doing [76:00] that bite work to bite the toy and it's [76:03] an excellent way to build toy drive the [76:04] next one is how do I get my dog to bite [76:07] harder when playing tug using Drive [76:09] building what we just talked about put [76:11] your dog on a back tide get them to bite [76:13] the tug so what I'll usually do is I'll [76:15] have the tug maybe even on a rope and [76:17] I'll swing it around swing it to where [76:19] the dog can catch it the dog catches it [76:21] once they catch it yay good puppy then I [76:24] grab the handles and I'll pull a little [76:26] bit and as long as they hold it good dog [76:28] then I'll release I'll go loose and what [76:31] most dogs will do is they'll rebuy they [76:32] get a full bite then I'll pull again a [76:34] good boy or good girl whichever dog I'm [76:36] working with grab it and work with the [76:38] dog and have a lot of fun and if the dog [76:41] does not have tight enough of a grip the [76:43] tug slips out and I tease the dog even [76:45] more I go haha I got the toy you don't [76:46] have it now haha and the dog is like oh [76:48] my gosh I want the toy and then I reward [76:50] the dog again and now they're gonna want [76:51] to hold on to it even harder because [76:53] you're using that frustration and [76:55] they're not gonna want it to slip out [76:56] and this will usually increase the [76:59] strength and what your dog is biting the [77:00] tug toy and again I'm gonna make a video [77:02] on this so you'll be able to see this in [77:04] action in the future do you use comb [77:06] does it serve any other purpose besides [77:08] a food dispenser which toys do you like [77:11] to use [77:11] with your dogs I think Kong's are great [77:13] Kong's are excellent I always use them [77:15] and this is something that I even tell [77:17] people when they're raising a puppy if [77:19] I'm raising a puppy I like to make that [77:22] puppy work for every single meal that it [77:24] eats it increases the value of the food [77:26] it makes the training much easier [77:27] especially in the beginning but not [77:29] everybody has that much time what you [77:31] don't want to do is you don't want to be [77:33] feeding your puppy out of a bowl so if I [77:35] don't have the time to train the puppy [77:37] and have the puppy take the food [77:38] directly from my hand I like to freeze [77:40] the puppy's food inside of the Kong now [77:42] what I use is I use raw dog food and I [77:45] stuff to come with raw dog food I freeze [77:47] it and then I'll feed that to the dog [77:49] and it makes a great meal and it's also [77:51] fun for them and keeps them active and [77:53] it satisfies a lot of those puppy needs [77:55] if you do not feed your dog raw what you [77:57] can do is you can put the kibble in a [77:59] bowl you can put some water in it wait [78:01] till the kibble absorbs all the water [78:02] and then stuff that into the comp and [78:05] freeze that and you can use it the exact [78:07] same way I also use Kong's to reward [78:09] when I'm training my dogs what's fun [78:11] about a Kong is it doesn't bounce in the [78:13] normal way that a ball will it kind of [78:14] flies all over the place which makes it [78:16] way more engaging for the dogs and most [78:19] dogs and I've worked with when I use a [78:20] calm as a reward they love chasing after [78:22] it it's kicking in that toy drive it's [78:25] kicking in that prey Drive and it's [78:26] kicking in that play Drive and they have [78:28] a good time so comms are great for that [78:29] as well I like to use a ball on a rope [78:32] when I'm training my dogs I enjoy [78:33] playing tug with them tennis balls if [78:36] I'm playing fetch I also use tennis [78:38] balls for scent detection now keep in [78:40] mind with all these toys I never let my [78:43] dogs play with the toys I supervise [78:45] first it lowers the value of the toy and [78:48] it's potentially dangerous the dogs can [78:51] eat part of the toy they can eat part of [78:53] the tennis ball it can create a ruptured [78:55] bowel blockage possibly death so I never [78:59] allow dogs to play with toys when [79:01] they're not being supervised there's [79:03] always some sort of supervision and [79:05] they're having to work for the toy again [79:06] to increase that value I enjoy playing [79:09] frisbee with my dog so I like to use [79:11] frisbees as a reward so those are the [79:13] main ones values bites leaves my dogs [79:15] enjoy biting the bites leave as well [79:17] I've done protection training with my [79:19] dog so they enjoy that any sort of [79:21] activity that they're going to enjoy by [79:23] incorporating the toys this is going [79:25] be a fun way to build a relationship and [79:27] bond with them but to answer your [79:28] question those are the toys that I like [79:30] to use Kong's are excellent another way [79:34] to satisfy that need to chew and to give [79:36] them something that is going to be good [79:38] for their health I like to give them raw [79:40] bones I talked about this as well the [79:42] thick raw bones or the bone marrow on [79:44] the inside and the raw meat on the [79:45] outside that makes an excellent reward [79:47] and treat for them as well when your dog [79:48] comes forward off the terminal marker [79:50] and you hold your hand high to get them [79:51] to jump for the reward do you hold the [79:53] treat in the same way in your hand can [79:55] you guide us through that part [79:56] specifically why you have them jumping [79:58] and how to hold the treat without [79:59] getting bit by an amped-up dog I always [80:02] reward them the same way I cup the food [80:04] in my hand which creates that little [80:06] Valley for the dogs to put their muzzle [80:07] in and get the reward when you work with [80:09] a dog long enough they know exactly how [80:11] you reward and they know how to get [80:13] access to that reward that's how my dogs [80:15] are I always reward them that way so [80:17] when I release my dog and I have them [80:19] jump up I have them do that because [80:20] there's more energy it's more fun and [80:23] the dog ends up performing the behaviors [80:25] better because of that release and that [80:27] reward in that that enjoyment that they [80:29] get from it so that's why I have them [80:31] jump it just adds a little bit more [80:33] energy to the training you don't have to [80:35] have your dog jump out of the terminal [80:37] marker like I do it's just something [80:39] that I like doing with my dogs and my [80:40] dogs seem to like it so that's why I [80:42] continue to do it and again I reward the [80:45] I reward my dogs with the food in my [80:48] hand the same way every time so I'm [80:50] never getting bit when my dog is trying [80:52] to get access to the food the only time [80:54] I've ever been accidentally bit by my [80:56] dogs is when I'm playing tug and I move [80:59] my tug too fast or my timing is off and [81:02] the dog gets my hand and any time the [81:04] dog has gotten my hand which has only [81:06] been a few times it's been my fault [81:08] because I moved the tug right when the [81:11] dog was going to bite it so that's [81:12] really the only way that I've been bit [81:14] when I've been playing with my dogs by [81:15] accident never by food because they know [81:17] where it is and how to get access to it [81:20] do you teach the double down if so do [81:22] you use a different command I want my [81:24] dog to down regular sometimes then other [81:26] times I would like them to lay down with [81:27] his head touching the floor okay so this [81:29] is a command I learned when I was going [81:32] through school to be a professional dog [81:33] trainer [81:35] and it was the tommrow school and Tom [81:37] Rose called this command because he [81:40] was a competitive obedience dog trainer [81:42] he competed in shits in now called IPL [81:44] and one of the exercises is tracking and [81:47] the way that he would teach the dogs to [81:49] indicate on the article so this is sport [81:52] talk the dog has when you when you do [81:55] competitive tracking with your dogs you [81:57] can only tell the dog to track unless [81:58] they've changed the rules I haven't [82:00] visited tracking in quite some time but [82:02] you tell the dog the track and your dog [82:03] has to go out in front of you on a long [82:05] line and that dog has to be the track [82:07] and there's articles on the track and [82:09] when the dog gets to the articles they [82:10] have to indicate that they found an [82:12] article and then you go and you pick it [82:14] up and you show the judge and you keep [82:16] going on the exercise you're not allowed [82:17] to tell the dog to sit when you think [82:19] the dog is at the article you can't cue [82:21] the dog into the alert for the article [82:26] so what Tom Rose did was he would teach [82:29] the dog in German to track he would call [82:31] it soup and that's the German command [82:33] for track and then he called Luke which [82:36] is the dog put in their head down on the [82:38] ground as if they're laying down resting [82:40] with their chin on the floor and he [82:42] called that hook and the way he taught [82:44] how to teach it was he would just say [82:45] OOP and then he would place the dog's [82:47] head down as long as the dog maintained [82:49] it he would reward him it's a very easy [82:51] command to teach and I'll actually put a [82:53] video up demonstrating how to teach this [82:56] this is a good command to have because [82:59] it's the only way where you can control [83:00] your dog's head because even then it [83:02] down they can look around so a lot of [83:04] trainers will teach them this command [83:05] and you can call it whatever you would [83:06] like to call it but I've always called [83:09] it oak as well because that's what I was [83:11] taught and this is great if you take [83:14] your dog to the vet and your dog's [83:15] getting vaccinated your dog's head is [83:18] completely controlled the veterinarian [83:20] can do what they need to do and it makes [83:21] the process very smooth so that is a [83:24] decent command to teach it can be [83:26] worthwhile and like I said I'll put a [83:27] video up specifically on how to teach [83:30] that any ideas on how to tire out dogs [83:32] mentally my German Shepherd is a high [83:34] drive dog and in no way I'm wearing him [83:36] out with physical exercise combined [83:38] deemed physical exercise with obedience [83:41] is one of the best ways to stimulate a [83:43] dog mentally and to wear them out I do [83:46] to my dogs all the time I make the [83:47] training fun and I'm incorporating a [83:50] little bit of physical exercise as well [83:51] so when I take my dogs out for example [83:54] to play fetch I won't just throw the [83:56] ball the entire time I'll have them do [83:58] commands so I get the ball I tell the [84:00] dog sit down spin Center free and then I [84:03] throw the ball so every time they're [84:05] doing something in order to get that [84:07] release and that reward you can also do [84:09] scent detection scent detection is a [84:11] great way to mentally stimulate our dogs [84:13] I'm gonna have an entire series on how [84:16] to teach your dogs scent detection so be [84:18] on the lookout for that but that's [84:20] another great way to again a mentally [84:22] stimulate your dog which will help wear [84:23] them out quite a bit and then another [84:25] thing you can do which I will be putting [84:26] a video up on is you can treadmill [84:28] trainer dog I know you said your dog is [84:30] very high energy when you treadmill [84:32] train a dog it actually wears them out [84:34] faster than just go in on a run or going [84:36] on a walk because they have to maintain [84:38] a very consistent speed and they have to [84:40] be very focused on that speed so that's [84:42] another great exercise to do as well [84:44] which I will be putting up a video on [84:46] how to teach your dog to run on a [84:48] treadmill alright everybody I hope this [84:50] video has proven to be helpful

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 453/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] before starting our figure 8 healing we [00:03] want to make sure that our dog first of [00:05] all knows leash pressure they understand [00:07] power steering and you've done the left [00:09] about turn as well as the right about [00:11] term then we're ready to do or then [00:13] we're ready to start our dog on figure 8 [00:15] heeling when I'm doing figure 8 heeling [00:17] first I'm gonna start off with some [00:18] cones cones make it a lot easier because [00:21] it's not somebody standing there when [00:23] you compete and you actually do figure 8 [00:25] heeling your dog is going to have to go [00:27] around people and that's gonna make it [00:29] much more difficult but for this video [00:31] and for these training purposes we're [00:33] gonna be using a cone but as your dog [00:35] gets better and they really get good at [00:36] doing the figure 8 with the cone you're [00:38] gonna want to practice with some people [00:40] as well get your dog used to doing the [00:42] figure 8 with people there so what we [00:45] want to do and this is what a lot of [00:46] people run into first of all we want to [00:49] start to where we're in the center of [00:51] both the cones the cones are gonna be [00:52] eight feet apart then when we step out [00:55] first we want to go to the one on our [00:57] left side when I go to that one when I'm [00:59] first doing this I'm doing it nice and [01:01] slow and I'm doing it with the power [01:02] steering or I'm helping my dog with the [01:05] leash for this the dog has to understand [01:07] that they need to slow down because [01:09] you're gonna have to go farther distance [01:11] they're gonna be going a shorter [01:13] distance because they're on the inside [01:15] at this point so as we go around they [01:17] have to know to slow down their pace [01:19] while you stay at the same pace they [01:21] have to adjust to your speed so we want [01:23] to go around we can help them with the [01:24] power steering that's gonna be one way [01:26] to do it or we can do it by having the [01:28] leash behind our back and we're gonna go [01:30] around that cone guiding the dog and [01:32] really getting them to understand how to [01:34] maintain that position and rewarding [01:36] them along the way if I notice my dog is [01:39] starting to go too far ahead of me what [01:41] I can do is I can add a little bit more [01:42] pressure to the leash and I can spin in [01:45] one position and then go back in to the [01:48] left about turn that's really gonna get [01:50] them to be aware of where you are and to [01:52] understand how to hold that position [01:54] correctly as you're doing the left cone [01:58] then you're gonna come back around and [02:00] now after you finish the left cone [02:03] you're gonna be going around the right [02:06] cone when you come around the right cone [02:08] now your dog is on the outside and [02:10] you're on the inside so in order for [02:12] your dog to maintain [02:13] Hill position they're going to have to [02:16] speed up because now they're traveling a [02:18] farther distance so often what I'll do [02:21] is as I'm guiding the dog I might use my [02:22] terminal marker and I'm gonna have them [02:25] go forward and quickly to get that piece [02:27] of food so they're gonna be going around [02:29] the cone use my terminal marker they're [02:31] gonna jump forward to get the food or [02:33] I'll just speed them up really quick or [02:35] maybe even spin in place and I'm gonna [02:38] do this over and over again but first [02:40] let's go through it let me show you [02:42] exactly how you guys are going to do [02:45] this to really get that figure eight [02:46] heeling and as we come back around we're [02:49] gonna want to stop and halt because you [02:51] have to do a halt next to one of the [02:54] individuals that are standing there for [02:56] your figure eight so you want to start [02:57] working that as well when you're doing [02:59] the figure eight exercise so make sure [03:00] you have a good automatic sit one halted [03:03] before you start to do this exercise [03:04] okay so we're gonna do the figure eight [03:06] with Charlie here you want to get our [03:08] dog in heel position we want to be [03:11] Center with the cones but not in between [03:14] them so right before them and then what [03:17] we're gonna do is we're gonna say heel [03:18] you're gonna want to step into your left [03:20] not your right the reason for this is if [03:23] you step to your right you go around [03:27] this cone it's gonna be a person though [03:29] around this one and then they're gonna [03:33] have you go around this one again and [03:36] then they're gonna have you stop right [03:38] here so break you're gonna make yourself [03:40] walk a much farther distance if you [03:44] choose to go to your right because if [03:46] you go to your left you're gonna go [03:47] around this one around that one and then [03:50] they're gonna hold you there instead of [03:51] doing that extra loop so you want to [03:54] make sure you start off going to your [03:55] right now remember as we talked about [03:58] before when we're going around the cone [04:00] on our left your dog is gonna be doing a [04:03] shorter distance so as they're going [04:06] they have to slow down to wait for you [04:08] if they go the same speed they're gonna [04:11] end up forging so you want to be aware [04:14] of that and then when you're coming [04:15] around this cone [04:16] they're gonna go farther distance so [04:20] they have to speed up so when I'm doing [04:22] this exercise he'll I like using the [04:28] power steering to show my dog to [04:31] maintain that tight position and then [04:33] around this count I will speed them up [04:36] and make it like a little race to get to [04:39] the other side of the comb so again this [04:42] one they slow down and this one I like [04:49] to get them used to going around that [04:50] corner much faster so again we go around [04:56] this comb pick up the speed nice and [04:59] sometimes if I have a dog that has a [05:02] tendency to forage right here what I [05:04] might do is I'll do a reverse spin or [05:06] I'll spiral in I'll show you what I mean [05:08] same with this one I'll come around and [05:10] I'll spin really quick in position and [05:12] then go back into my heel and then when [05:15] I come into the left side I'm gonna spin [05:17] in position right here and go back into [05:21] the walk and that's gonna help teach my [05:23] dog to maintain proper heel position as [05:26] we're doing the figure eight because [05:28] what can happen right here they can [05:31] start to forge if you don't do it [05:33] correctly and you don't do enough of [05:34] reps and here they can start to lag see [05:37] how he's lagging and we don't want that [05:39] we wanted to stay next to us so it's [05:42] gonna take a lot of repetition if you're [05:44] using this reward-based training [05:46] technique I'm using our power steering [05:49] it's really good to understand to go in [05:52] front of you even if I have to cut [05:54] across like that just for training it's [05:57] gonna be okay so we come around [06:02] and pick up speed freak good get them to [06:05] rush forward to get that food get them [06:07] to slow down [06:09] good job buddy we also want to practice [06:13] good our Holtz as we come up to the comb [06:17] yes yes [06:20] he'll good stand on the slowed down [06:24] maintaining that position nicely [06:28] speeding up around that cone heel step [06:32] off and here our dog needs to slow down [06:35] good girl and I'm gonna speed up I might [06:41] even take off I want her to anticipate [06:43] picking up the speed over there good [06:45] girl [06:46] so here slow down nice beautiful turn [06:49] girl so she needs a little help on that [06:54] right about turn all right [07:05] there we go she's already starting to [07:07] fix herself free that's gonna be the [07:10] picture that we want it developed this [07:12] using the exact technique you saw that I [07:15] was implementing on Charlie let me show [07:18] you how we can do this as well using [07:19] pressure based training using that leash [07:21] pressure so for the left we can keep the [07:25] leash behind our back heel so we step [07:28] off we can use it to kind of control [07:31] their position a little bit using them [07:33] each pressure good girl and then when we [07:40] come back around switch it to the right [07:43] side keep them tight pressure find me [07:46] two just to guide them and make it as [07:48] clear as possible some people will even [07:51] do this with two leashes one in the [07:54] front and one in the back you want to [08:01] switch sides get over there real quick [08:03] thank you [08:07] really taking the duck that really [08:10] taking the time to develop the leash [08:13] pressure skill for your dog and [08:14] following the leash will help a great [08:17] deal with a lot of these exercises so [08:18] again heel we step off I keep the leash [08:21] behind my back and I can use a little [08:24] bit of tension if I need to to get her [08:26] to maintain that position same when I [08:28] come around here if I need to I can pull [08:30] a bit just to get her to come forward [08:33] I'm only doing as much as what is [08:35] necessary to get her to do it correctly [08:38] I don't want to be pulling her the whole [08:40] way you see it's loose for the most part [08:41] and then if I need to I can guide her a [08:44] little bit but the leash isn't getting [08:45] really tight it's just there to use as a [08:48] tool to help my dog get the position and [08:51] to really understand it in the most [08:53] clear way possible the more clear you [08:56] are communicating with your dog the [08:57] faster they're gonna learn these more [08:59] complex exercise [09:00] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

Not only will they be comfortable with fireworks, but they will learn to love it! 1) Using counter-conditioning. You need to keep in mind the concept of predictability when working with a dog. If our dogs are afraid of something, often it's because they don't know what it means (like fireworks), it has predicted something bad in the past and the dog has been conditioned to be afraid, or the dog lacks confidence. In either case, we want it to now predict something pleasant, so the dog changes the way they feel about it. The main idea is that it predicts something pleasant. 2) Using the concept of counter conditioning with desensitization. For example; When I'm training a sports protection dog they have to become desensitized to gunshots because one of the exercises requires the dog to bite the decoy (person in bite suit) while the decoy is firing a blank pistol. We do this by first firing the blank pistol at a distance that doesn't trouble the dog. As the dog becomes more comfortable with the sound, we slowly, over time (could be weeks or even months), bring the gunshots closer and closer to the dog, until the dog isn't bothered by it at all."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 456/468,"Here is another example; I had a dog that I was working with a few years back that was terrified in public, and in two weeks we were able to fix the issue. Keep in mind that each dog will take a different amount of time to learn a new behavior or increase in confidence. Here's what I did with that dog to fix the issue using a combination of desensitized and counter conditioning. First I ONLY fed the dog and did obedience outside of the house. The first day I was in my front yard training, as the days progressed, I slowly moved to more locations with slightly more activity. As the dog's confidence continued to go up, we went to even more locations with more activity. By the second week, I was doing obedience with the dog inside of a local home depot and Petsmart. It's important to keep in mind that I did not feed the dog in the house where the dog was comfortable. I wanted the dog to associate the public locations with the pleasant experience of training and food rewards.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 457/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we're gonna be conditioning our [00:01] dogs to love fireworks now it's a very [00:04] simple process there's certain types of [00:06] terminology you may hear in the dog [00:08] training world one is going to be [00:09] counter conditioning and another one is [00:11] going to be desensitized [00:13] but what we really want to focus on is [00:15] the concept of predictability you've [00:17] probably heard me talk about this in a [00:18] lot of my other videos so a lot of this [00:20] stuff is very transferable now when a [00:22] dog is afraid of sometimes there's [00:24] usually a few reasons one either they [00:26] had a bad experience so this could be a [00:28] form of PTSD for our dogs another one is [00:31] it's the fear of the unknown they don't [00:33] know what it is and they can't explain [00:36] it and since I don't know what it is it [00:37] could create fear this is what happens a [00:39] lot with fireworks and the last one is a [00:41] lack of confidence so what we're gonna [00:43] do is we're gonna focus on the one that [00:45] has to do with the lack of knowledge our [00:47] not knowing what it is so what we're [00:49] gonna do is the concept of [00:51] predictability we're going to take the [00:53] sound of fireworks and I have some [00:54] speakers over here when we're getting a [00:57] dog desensitize to something there's one [00:59] of two ways we can do it one we can [01:01] either have distance so if they're [01:02] afraid of something we get the dog far [01:04] enough from whatever it is that they're [01:06] afraid of and we get them closer and [01:08] closer over time by having that whatever [01:11] it is predict something pleasant so for [01:13] example when training protection dogs [01:15] one of the exercises is the decoy the [01:18] man in the bite suit will fire a pistol [01:19] a blank while the dog is biting them we [01:22] don't just have the dog bite the man in [01:24] the suit and have them fire right away [01:25] because then the dog can become afraid [01:27] of that but rather we start the dog far [01:29] away and we fire the blanks and we feed [01:31] the dog with treats and we reward them [01:32] and we play with them we get them [01:34] comfortable to that sound and we move [01:36] them closer and closer to a point where [01:38] it's no longer a big deal that's the [01:39] same thing we're gonna be doing with [01:41] fireworks we're gonna incorporate the [01:42] play and then we're also going to use [01:44] mealtime as an opportunity to make the [01:46] sound of the fireworks predict something [01:48] pleasant occasion so like I said I first [01:50] like to start on something simple a [01:52] small speaker and hasn't get comfortable [01:54] with that I increase the volume and I'll [01:56] use a more powerful speaker such as one [01:58] like this right here and then maybe even [02:00] something more powerful in the future so [02:03] what we're gonna do is I'm gonna take [02:05] my phone and I'm going to connect it to [02:07] the Bluetooth and we're gonna play [02:09] fireworks we're gonna do that while [02:12] we're playing French so let me get the [02:14] toy dogs also feed off of each other so [03:01] if you have a dog that's a little bit [03:03] more confident it's good to use that dog [03:05] to help teach the other dog that it's [03:07] not a big deal so for example dishes [03:09] here he's afraid of fireworks and that's [03:12] one of the reasons why he's here we're [03:13] working on this issue of fireworks but [03:15] the fact that he's around the other dogs [03:17] that aren't afraid of the fireworks he's [03:19] feeding off of that so if you do have [03:21] somebody who has a dog that's not afraid [03:23] of fireworks you can use that as an [03:24] opportunity to help build the other dogs [03:27] competence okay so this is what we're [03:29] gonna do now I would continue to play [03:30] but I don't need you guys listening to [03:32] fireworks [03:32] while playing chuck it for an hour with [03:34] the dogs but this is the concept you're [03:37] gonna play with your dog and you're [03:38] gonna have the sound of the fireworks [03:39] playing in the background now another [03:41] thing you want to do because we're [03:43] getting closer to the fourth of July and [03:44] if you live in a place like la where [03:46] they're already shooting on fireworks [03:48] you can use it as an opportunity to play [03:51] fetch with their dogs so on fireworks [03:52] start going off in the neighborhood here [03:54] I get excited with my dogs I go it's [03:57] playtime and we run outside and start [03:59] playing fetch so now when my dogs hear [04:01] the sound of fireworks they become [04:03] really excited and really happy [04:04] now remember predictability we want the [04:07] sound of the fireworks to predict [04:08] something plus [04:09] so we can use play and we can also use [04:11] mealtime now when I'm working with a dog [04:13] that is fearful of fireworks I like to [04:15] use as many opportunities as possible to [04:17] get that dog desensitized to the [04:19] fireworks [04:20] so with Bishop here he normally eats 30 [04:22] ounces of raw food every day raw dog [04:24] food so what I'm doing is I'm breaking [04:26] it down into 6 meals and I'm feeding him [04:28] roughly 5 ounces throughout the day 6 [04:30] times so this gives me 6 opportunities [04:32] every single day to help him become [04:35] desensitized to the sound of the [04:36] fireworks but to also use the concept of [04:39] counter conditioning where we're taking [04:41] something that he may have been afraid [04:42] of before and we're simply making it [04:44] predict something pleasant so what I do [04:46] is I weigh out the food then I go ahead [04:49] to my phone and I connect it with the [04:52] fireworks so now here's the fireworks [05:03] so now so now he's eating the fireworks [05:07] but he's eating his meal and he's [05:11] enjoying it and you can hear the [05:13] fireworks so now he's going to start [05:14] associating mealtime with the sound of [05:17] the fireworks and again this is a really [05:18] great way to use that concept of [05:21] desensitizing fireworks [05:26] thank you so much for watching guys let [05:28] me know what you think about it in the [05:29] comments below and be sure to like [05:31] subscribe to get that notification [05:33] thanks again

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 460/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] come here puppies we're filming come [00:02] here come here good puppy [00:04] all right guys in today's video we're [00:06] gonna be talking about puppy biting now [00:19] puppy biting is something that most [00:21] puppies will grow out of it's very [00:23] similar to a child sucking their thumb [00:25] most kids will grow out of it and that's [00:28] the same with our puppies but if it is [00:29] something that you want to stop there [00:31] are a few techniques that can get you [00:33] the results that you need [00:34] with my puppies I don't worry about it [00:36] because like I said they do grow out of [00:37] it but sometimes those sharp little [00:39] teeth can hurt quite a bit so the first [00:41] one is redirecting now we have to think [00:43] about when we're redirecting a puppy's [00:45] behavior it's not stopping the behavior [00:48] so if I teach this puppy that when he [00:50] goes to bite me I give him something [00:52] else that's okay to bite it's not [00:54] teaching him not to bite my hand because [00:56] my hand is still fun it's still a toy [00:58] I'm just presenting a new toy I'm giving [01:00] him a different option so then if the [01:02] toy goes away he goes oh here's my other [01:05] toy I'm gonna go bite it so it's not [01:08] fixing the problem but it is giving the [01:10] puppy a different option so that is [01:12] something to keep in mind and it's a [01:13] great option because it does give the [01:15] puppy something to bite it satisfies [01:17] that need and it prevents your hand from [01:18] getting bit and like I said most dogs [01:21] pretty much every dog I've trained will [01:23] grow out of this biting stage but if you [01:25] do want to redirect it it's good to have [01:28] a toy and simply take the toy and make [01:30] the toy more interesting then you're [01:33] handing good you got it and now we're [01:35] taking the behavior and we're [01:36] redirecting it to something else now [01:39] again keep in mind it doesn't teach the [01:40] puppy not to bite your hand cuz let me [01:42] show you I'm gonna take this toy away by [01:44] lifting him up let's gets him to drop it [01:46] so I'm not stealing it you dropped it [01:48] yes you did and then I move that out of [01:50] the way and watch he's probably gonna [01:52] bite my hand oh there he goes [01:53] cuz it's still a toy so you have to keep [01:56] that in mind it's not gonna stop the [01:58] behavior but it will save your hands [02:00] from getting bit up cos there's the toy [02:03] good so again we're able to redirect it [02:06] another option is if you have treats on [02:08] you you can direct your puppy into doing [02:10] some obedience if you like you can have [02:12] your puppy sit [02:13] get it get it off my fingertips or you [02:15] can have your puppy laid down and just [02:19] kind of switch your your puppy's gears [02:21] into thinking something different than [02:22] biting your hand but both of those [02:24] they're not teaching the puppy not to [02:27] bite your hand they're just giving them [02:29] a different option now if you do want to [02:32] stop it there are a couple other [02:33] techniques one of the techniques that I [02:35] like to use is the soft tissue [02:37] underneath their chin and the soft [02:39] tissue inside of their mouth if they go [02:41] to bite your hand are you tired [02:43] we still need a book lovely now I'm not [02:46] gonna do it to them but if you need it [02:47] to you just grab right in this area [02:49] and you would hold it now you don't want [02:51] to squeeze so hard that it hurts the [02:53] puppy all you want to do is make it a [02:55] neutral experience because right now [02:57] biting my hand is fun if I grabbed it [03:00] and I took away the play then it would [03:02] make it a neutral experience so it [03:03] wouldn't be something that would be [03:04] interesting to the dog that is an option [03:07] that I like to do because it doesn't [03:08] hurt the puppy but it will get most [03:10] puppies to stop biting another thing [03:13] that some trainers will do which I'm not [03:14] a big fan of is they'll take the lip and [03:17] they'll push the puppy's lip on their [03:19] own canines I don't like to do that [03:20] because I don't want to hurt the puppy I [03:22] don't want them to cut their mouth [03:23] so that's not an option that I would [03:25] recommend but this one works great where [03:27] you hold it and you want to hold it [03:29] there till the puppy pulls away you [03:31] don't want to let go because if you let [03:34] go it defeats the purpose like I'm [03:35] letting go right now but again I don't [03:37] I'm not trying to stop him from biting [03:39] because I like it it's fun now the last [03:42] option is using a training collar so you [03:45] have a collar on just a normal flat [03:46] nylon collar you have a leash the puppy [03:49] goes to bite you would go no and you pop [03:51] the leash the moment the puppy stops [03:52] biting you go yay good puppy and then [03:55] you reward them for doing the correct [03:56] behavior so you're saying if you bite [03:58] there's going to be a correction and [04:00] then when you stop biting I'm gonna [04:02] praise and reward you so those are going [04:04] to be the main techniques that people [04:06] use when it comes to stopping a puppy [04:08] from play biting but like I said if [04:10] you're okay with it I mean you might [04:12] have some scratches and cuts but they do [04:14] grow out of it and for me it's just [04:17] given the puppy an opportunity to [04:18] explore their world it's what they do [04:20] they don't explore with their hands they [04:22] explore with their mouths so that's how [04:24] they investigate the world they're [04:25] checking things out there putting [04:26] different things in their mouth you're [04:27] like Oh your hand what is that what's [04:29] this over here so I let them explore it [04:31] it's great for them and it's really cool [04:34] for building a puppy's confidence having [04:36] fun and building a nice bond with your [04:38] puppy cuz again they're not biting [04:40] you're like this isn't aggression even [04:41] though you can see he's making little [04:42] snarls with his face he's just plain [04:44] he's having a good time [04:46] and he's becoming my little buddy [04:48] alright I hope you guys enjoyed today's [04:50] video let me know you

In episode one, I will be introducing the first step that I like to teach a dog when training them on scent detection. Anytime I'm teaching a dog a new behavior, I want to first be sure to get the dog to perform the behavior with a physical cue. Before starting this exercise your dog should already be trained on their markers (conditioned reinforcers) and should be trained to be proactive. The links to learn how to teach these to your dog are below.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 464/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey guys nature Elmer here in today's [00:01] video we're gonna be working on [00:02] introducing scent detection for our dogs [00:05] [Music] [00:14] [Music] [00:15] the very first thing that I like to do [00:18] is teach the dog the behavior that I [00:19] would like them to perform so what I'm [00:21] gonna do this is an exercise known as [00:23] fixed shaping so we have something in [00:25] mind we would like our dog to perform [00:26] and then when they do it we're going to [00:28] use our terminal marker and then we're [00:30] going to reward them I'm gonna be [00:31] demonstrating with re here first I'm [00:33] going to be using a climb platform I [00:35] simply want my dog to jump up on the [00:37] platform once she jumps up on the [00:39] platform [00:40] I'm gonna use my terminal marker [00:41] encouraging her to jump off so she can [00:42] get her reward and we're gonna repeat [00:44] the process once she has that down and [00:47] she fully understands that concept then [00:49] I'm gonna introduce the different [00:51] containers that my dog is going to be [00:52] placing her nose into once we start [00:55] adding the odor for our scent detection [00:56] work so right now during this exercise [00:59] we're not going to be using any actual [01:00] odor that will come in in my next video [01:03] so let me show you how I'm gonna do this [01:05] so first she's on the platform I'm gonna [01:06] go free let her jump down and get the [01:08] reward then I'm gonna wait till she [01:10] jumps back on free I'm not asking her to [01:13] do it I'm waiting till she does it on [01:15] her own free good so you can use free [01:21] whatever your terminal marker is to get [01:23] your dog to do this behavior free very [01:25] good you can see she's picking it up [01:27] free very quickly and I'm saying at the [01:30] moment she jumps on the platform free [01:33] now with someone you might have to do [01:35] you might have to walk to the platform [01:37] to encourage your dog free or to kind of [01:40] give them a little bit of a hint kind of [01:41] an idea of what it is you want them to [01:43] do free good and I've done a lot of free [01:48] proactive training with Ari so she knows [01:51] that she's gonna start seeking out [01:53] behaviors that's going to get her [01:54] rewards that's why she's coming into a [01:56] sit front right now but I'm gonna kind [01:58] of help her out free to let her know [02:00] that it's jumping on the platform free [02:02] is what I want if you're using a clicker [02:05] this is when you would click your dog [02:06] would jump up click and then you allow [02:08] them to come down to get the reward your [02:10] dog would jump up click and then reward [02:13] our markers pinpoint a moment in time [02:15] when our dog is right or wrong that's [02:19] why it's called a marker because it is [02:20] marking a moment in time [02:22] so my F REE is my terminal marker this [02:26] is letting her know she did it correctly [02:28] she's going to get a reward and she is [02:30] released from that position free very [02:33] good so now we have her doing that now [02:35] we're gonna jump to the next step this [02:37] is where we're going to add the [02:39] container that will we be placing our [02:41] odors in in the future exercises now [02:44] this exercise normally with most dogs [02:47] that I'm training scent detection I'll [02:49] do just this exercise for a couple free [02:52] for a couple days really getting them to [02:54] understand free the concept of jumping [02:57] up on that platform in order to get free [02:59] that reward okay so I'm gonna get the [03:02] new the item that we want so again this [03:04] would be a new session the idea is you [03:06] come back out you're getting ready to do [03:08] this session again but now the picture [03:10] is a little bit different it's not just [03:12] your climb platform but there is also a [03:14] container so I'm gonna use three [03:16] different containers these are the same [03:18] containers that I use every time I teach [03:20] a dog scent detection I'm gonna be using [03:22] a cinder block wrapped in duct tape and [03:25] that keeps the edges from being sharp [03:27] you never want your dog to have a bad [03:29] experience when you're teaching them a [03:31] new behavior or a new exercise then I'm [03:34] gonna be using an empty bucket and then [03:36] I'm gonna be using an empty box with a [03:38] hole cut in the top so you're gonna see [03:40] how we will be doing this so again new [03:42] day I come out and it's gonna be a [03:44] little bit of a different picture so let [03:46] me show you so now this would be as if [03:48] we're doing another session it's a new [03:50] day and the only thing that's different [03:54] is now the cinder block is on the [03:56] platform I'm gonna wait till she jumps [03:59] on but this time I'm not gonna reward [04:00] her for jumping on the platform I'm [04:03] gonna wait until she decides to [04:05] investigate the new object I have not [04:08] done scent detection with her so [04:10] hopefully this doesn't take her too long [04:12] but we'll see so I'm gonna release her [04:15] from her downst a break and then I'm [04:18] gonna wait she sticks her nose inside of [04:21] the cinder block [04:26] free good so you see how she stuck her [04:29] nose in it to naturally investigate it I [04:32] might have dropped the piece and I'm [04:37] just gonna wait I like my dogs to be a [04:40] little bit more proactive when it comes [04:42] to doing this exercise free good good [04:46] girl again there's no odor I'm just [04:49] waiting for the behavior free good girl [04:52] you have to make sure you say the marker [04:55] and that's that free could at the exact [04:58] moment your dog does the right behavior [05:02] free so you see she's trying to do other [05:05] behaviors to get the reward but free the [05:08] only one that's gonna work right now is [05:09] putting her nose inside of the [05:11] cinderblock wait good girl very good she [05:16] likes to lay down as well free good girl [05:19] good job try not to drop food like me [05:22] come on free very good free excellent [05:28] job re free good girl [05:34] free very good free nice so I would [05:40] break free so now I would allow her to [05:44] do this with the center block for [05:46] another day maybe two but it depends on [05:49] the dog each dog is going to learn at a [05:52] different pace so base it on how quickly [05:54] your dog is figuring out the exercise [05:56] and what it is that you expect from them [05:58] so now that she's doing it nicely with [06:01] the cinder block now I'm gonna add a new [06:03] item so this time it's going to be a [06:05] bucket so this might be day three now a [06:08] day three there's a new container same [06:10] position where I had the cinder block [06:12] but it's a different container and the [06:14] same idea we're gonna wait to try to see [06:16] if our dog is naturally going to do the [06:18] behavior we're trying to get them to [06:20] perform which is going to be to [06:21] investigate the bucket later this is [06:23] going going to transition into we're [06:26] gonna have owners in it and you'll see [06:27] how we're gonna do that in the future [06:29] videos so again this would be another [06:31] day or another training session I bring [06:33] her out and I walk over to the platform [06:34] brick brick all I set it early [06:39] free good girl so you see she's figuring [06:42] out that free it's again looking into [06:44] the container free good job re free very [06:50] good free excellent free so that time I [06:57] wanted her to stay in a little bit [06:58] longer so I can ask for duration free [07:01] good girl [07:03] free I wouldn't ask for too much [07:06] duration in the beginning free because [07:09] success I've said this in many of my [07:10] videos builds on success the more [07:12] success free they have the more willing [07:15] the more they're going to be willing to [07:17] try harder if they don't get the free if [07:19] they don't get the reward right away so [07:20] I'm gonna make her work a little harder [07:21] again free good girl [07:27] free very nice you see how she's placing [07:29] her head in a little deeper Rick good [07:31] girl so now I'm gonna get the final [07:34] container and like I said it's just a [07:35] box has a lid on and there's a hole cut [07:38] in the very top enough for my dog to [07:40] stick her muzzle in so let me go ahead [07:42] and grab that and I'll show you the last [07:43] portion so now this would be the next [07:46] day or maybe just later on in the day [07:49] and a new session this does go pretty [07:50] fast for some dogs so like I said with [07:52] REI I've done a lot of proactive dog [07:54] training I talked about this in one of [07:56] my episodes I recommend checking it out [07:58] and so now I'm gonna do the same thing [08:01] I'm gonna walk over I'm gonna wait till [08:02] she does the correct behavior and then [08:04] I'm gonna simply mark and reward I want [08:06] her to place her nose inside of the box [08:08] break free and she's figured out the [08:13] game already pretty quickly free good [08:15] girl [08:17] free very nice free excellent job re [08:25] free good girl [08:27] free free good job re [08:34] free [08:37] free yeah baby alright so that would be [08:42] a good session this is going to be the [08:44] start make sure your dog knows the [08:46] markers you want to have the terminal [08:47] marker that's what I use the entire time [08:49] because I'm allowing her to she's done [08:51] you could technically use yes because [08:53] we're not using a verbal command [08:55] remember when we use a verbal command [08:57] that's when we reinforce the stay so [08:59] when you use a continuation marker down [09:01] if I told her down and I said yes then [09:04] she's in a down stay if I used fre e [09:07] free then she would be released re I [09:10] said free then she'd be released and [09:13] she'd be able to get the reward so we [09:15] want to have those and then also make [09:17] sure you do some of that proactive dog [09:19] training the video where I talk about do [09:22] we always have to reward our dog with [09:23] treats is where I talk about an exercise [09:26] known as free shaping free shaping is [09:28] incredibly important and it's going to [09:29] help you quite a bit when you start [09:31] doing fixed shaping so that's what we're [09:33] using right now to get our dog to do [09:34] this behavior so in the next video [09:36] you're gonna see we're gonna start [09:37] adding odors we're gonna start doing a [09:38] lot of cool stuff so this is an easy [09:41] great way to start this exercise I hope [09:43] you guys enjoyed today's video some [09:46] people were asking about my shirt there [09:48] is a link in the description so if you'd [09:49] like to order one for yourself that's [09:51]

Any suggestions on how to fix that? 15:12 - If I tell my dog a command and he doesn't comply, I correct him, then he will comply. Should I then reward the dog or just go on to the next command? 16:13 - How do you train a dog to have a more reliable recall even when she's busy doing something else? 17:48 - How much and how often do you feed your dogs daily? 19:14 - My 14 Week old puppy has started barking at people when they come in our yard. Is it best to wait until he is not barking, then mark and reward or try and have him close to me and feed him and distract him before people walk in? 24:19 - We are learning to do the run walk run method of running. I do 1 min run and 30-sec walk. My problem is when we do an out and back run, on the way out they drag behind me, then on the way back, they will run beside me. Why? All I can figure is that they are thinking woohoo we are going back home and I want to get there fast. How can I get them to run beside me the whole time? 26:05 - I’m going to get a Great Pyrenees puppy this fall and I was doing research into the breed and it says that they’re neither food nor toy motivated. When I talked to the breeder she said that motivation is the hardest thing about training them. I’ve watched all your videos on motivation but was wondering if you have any specific tips on training dogs that are harder to motivate and get bored easily. Thanks a lot! 29:04 - I have an 8-year-old staffi who has separation anxiety."

Do you use your markers during non-specific training periods? 40:27 - My dog has a lazy sit. 41:09 - Some advice on collecting your puppy and transporting them home would be great? 41:54 - In your video, you use a hard bone for puppies. 43:06 - I have a short question, and I remember you saying you feed your dogs a raw diet. 44:00 - I’m just curious if you can elaborate a little bit on why we are using Free instead of yes during retrieval training? 45:35 - I made the mistake of teaching my dogs to stay quiet and not bark. Now I want her to bark but she hardly does. 47:02 - What's the difference between place and climb? 48:09 - Most trainers that I know use Command and Cue interchangeably. What you are calling the ‘Cue’ starts as a lure or something and turns into a hand signal?"

when he is [00:31] in our yard off leash she will often not [00:32] come when I call him he will just sit [00:34] down and look at me I've been working [00:36] the recall command sit and down and he [00:37] seems to perform them fine when I use [00:39] treats okay so when we are giving our [00:42] dog commands we have to keep in mind [00:43] that we should be teaching our dogs [00:45] formal commands and informal commands if [00:47] we're using a formal command a formal [00:49] command would be something like sit down [00:50] come heel those are very formal and [00:52] every time we give our dog those [00:54] commands we expect them to perform the [00:56] behavior an informal command is [00:58] something more like this and let's go [00:59] guys come on puppies that's very [01:02] informal that's trying to get our dogs [01:04] to come to us without giving them a [01:06] formal command if you are going to use a [01:08] formal command whether it's in training [01:09] or out of training you have to make sure [01:11] that you can reinforce the behavior [01:13] every single time you give your dog that [01:15] command so if it was my puppy that I'm [01:17] training and I'm starting to realize if [01:19] I call him when he's in the yard not [01:20] during a training routine my puppy is [01:22] not listening well then I'm not going to [01:23] continue to try to call him because then [01:25] my puppy's gonna learn every time I'm [01:27] into the yard and he calls my name I [01:29] don't have to listen to him so what I [01:31] would do is I maybe play with the puppy [01:33] get the puppy to come to me while [01:34] engaging with them having a good time [01:36] then I'm gonna hook a long line to my [01:37] puppy and I'm gonna let my puppy go back [01:39] to exploring the yard once my puppy is [01:42] not paying attention and they're kind of [01:43] in a different zone then I'm going to [01:45] call my puppy to me and I'm gonna [01:47] reinforce the behavior by using the long [01:49] line this is going to give me an [01:50] opportunity to show my puppy it doesn't [01:52] matter what's going on it doesn't matter [01:54] what you're doing if I give you a come [01:56] one called command you need to come the [01:57] moment that I call you look at it this [01:59] way [02:00] anyway time we want our puppy or our [02:01] dogs to perform a behavior in a certain [02:03] environment we have to rehearse that [02:05] with our dog or our puppy we can't [02:07] expect them to do it perfectly without [02:09] practicing it if you think about theater [02:11] people who perform on stage [02:13] the first time you go to watch them [02:14] perform that's not their first time [02:16] performing that routine or that play or [02:19] that stand-up comedy show whatever it is [02:21] they've rehearsed it over and over and [02:23] over and over again to make sure that [02:25] they're able to do it perfectly when the [02:27] day comes and they're onstage look at [02:29] that the same way as when you're [02:31] training your puppy or your dog you have [02:33] to rehearse every situation if there's a [02:35] certain situation you would like your [02:36] puppy or your dog to act a very specific [02:38] way then you need to rehearse it over [02:40] and over again so when the real [02:42] situation takes place your puppy or your [02:44] dog knows exactly what to do another [02:46] part of that question was the training [02:48] treats in the very beginning when we're [02:49] training a dog we're using continual [02:51] reinforcement we are rewarding every [02:53] single behavior every time our dog does [02:54] a behavior we mark we reward I start to [02:57] space out the rewards once my dog is [02:59] starting to perform the behaviors on the [03:01] verbal command alone so I say down my [03:03] dog blaze down without having to point [03:05] to the ground I say sit and my dog sits [03:06] without having to lift up on the food I [03:08] say come my dog comes to me without [03:09] having to cue my dog with that physical [03:11] cue once I get my dog to perform all the [03:14] behaviors on the verbal command alone [03:15] then I start spacing out the rewards so [03:18] in the very beginning that's it yes [03:19] reward down yes reward come yes reward [03:21] heel yes reward then it's gonna turn [03:23] into sit yes reward down good nice job [03:26] come very good excellent heel good girl [03:29] or good boy down yes reward then [03:32] eventually it's going to turn into sit [03:34] down good nice job come excellent [03:38] heel down sit yes reward so I'm starting [03:43] to space out the rewards in the [03:44] beginning we're going to be giving our [03:46] dogs verbal feedback but we're not gonna [03:48] reward on every single one then [03:49] eventually it can turn into sit down [03:51] come heel spin roll over plate it yes [03:54] reward remember our dogs are always [03:56] doing things based on motivations are [03:57] either motivated to access something [03:59] pleasant or they're motivated to prevent [04:00] something unpleasant we determine what [04:02] motivating factors are going to [04:04] influence our dog's behavior so your dog [04:06] has to believe that there's a [04:07] possibility that they're going to [04:09] receive a reward or they have to believe [04:10] there's a possibility that if they don't [04:12] do the behavior they may receive a [04:14] correction as long as your dog or your [04:16] puppy believes that then they will [04:18] perform the behaviors that you're asking [04:19] them to perform this comes with training [04:21] and a lot of repetition so that's how [04:23] we're gonna start spacing out the [04:24] rewards definitely check out my video [04:26] that I have on the [04:27] subject I explained it a little bit [04:29] better there so let's move on to the [04:30] next question I just brought my four [04:32] month old puppy in for his booster shots [04:33] and check up at the veterinarian and she [04:35] told me that my puppy was very difficult [04:36] to restrain and that he not did not like [04:38] being held down for blood work etc she [04:41] said that he might need some training [04:42] which surprised me since I've been [04:43] working with him every day should one [04:45] expect the puppy that old not to [04:47] complain when being restrained this is [04:48] going to depend a lot on the individual [04:50] puppy some dogs are gonna be more [04:52] willing or some puppies are gonna be [04:54] more willing to just sit down and relax [04:55] it depends on the breed and it depends [04:58] on the individual so for example my dog [05:00] ari when she was a young puppy she did [05:02] not like being held she did not like [05:03] being restrained she would squirm she [05:06] would wiggle and she's a great dog she [05:08] grew up into an excellent dog when I'm [05:10] doing obedience with the puppy I've [05:11] talked about this in a lot of my other [05:12] videos I make it fun I try to make it [05:15] engaging [05:15] I want the puppy to enjoy it as much as [05:17] possible I'm getting them to perform the [05:19] behaviors in their mind they're doing [05:21] the position to jump up and access a [05:23] reward or to play with the toy so it [05:25] becomes something that they enjoy quite [05:26] a bit now you're not going to have [05:29] reliability or full reliability when [05:31] training a puppy especially in the early [05:33] stages if you're not using any form of [05:35] positive punishment you will never have [05:37] 100% reliability within your obedience [05:40] and I don't recommend correcting puppies [05:43] for obedience training we have to keep [05:45] in mind we have obedience issues and we [05:47] have behavioral issues an obedience [05:48] issue is the dog doesn't sit when I ask [05:51] them to sit the dog doesn't down when I [05:52] ask them to down the dog doesn't come to [05:53] me when I give the dog to come when [05:55] called command [05:56] these are obedience issues but then we [05:58] have behavioral issues a behavioral [06:00] issue is the dog digs the dog chews up [06:02] furniture the dog is drinking out of the [06:04] toilet bowl the dog is chasing squirrels [06:05] rabbits and cars these are all [06:07] behavioral issues these are things that [06:09] we do not want the dog to perform at all [06:11] an obedience issue is only bad because [06:13] the dog is not listening to us [06:15] the act of not sitting when the dog is [06:17] laying down is not a bad behavior it's [06:20] only bad because we want him to sit when [06:22] he's laying down and he's choosing not [06:23] to listen so this is the difference [06:25] between obedience and behavioral issues [06:27] when I'm working with a puppy I will [06:29] correct them when they're a puppy using [06:31] a physical correction to stop behavioral [06:34] issues no you may not chase cars give [06:37] the dog a correction or give the puppy a [06:38] correction [06:40] is important because it's for the safety [06:42] of the puppy I don't want the puppy [06:44] running into the street and getting hit [06:46] by a car if somebody accidentally leaves [06:48] the front door open [06:49] so I'm gonna make sure the puppy knows [06:50] that going towards the street is not [06:52] okay [06:53] chasing cars is not okay and I will give [06:55] them a physical correction to stop that [06:57] behavior now we never want to use a [07:00] physical correction to stop a behavior [07:02] that is based on fear if you have a dog [07:04] or puppy that is doing a behavior based [07:06] on fear the best choice is to use [07:08] counter conditioning as well as [07:10] desensitizing the dog to whatever it is [07:12] that they are afraid of if you try to [07:14] use a physical correction to stop a [07:16] behavior that is based on fear you will [07:18] only make that fear worse for example [07:21] let's say you have your dog in a [07:23] down-stay and your dog is terrified of [07:25] fireworks and your dog breaks the down [07:28] stay because somebody starts shooting [07:29] off fireworks you're not gonna want to [07:32] correct your dog for breaking that down [07:33] state because in the dog's mind he's not [07:36] or she's not breaking the down state but [07:38] rather escaping the fireworks and if you [07:40] correct them for breaking the down state [07:42] because they're afraid of the fireworks [07:43] and they're trying to get away the dog [07:45] is going to associate the correction [07:46] with the fireworks and the fear for the [07:49] fireworks is going to become much [07:51] greater because the dogs trying to [07:52] escape it they're afraid correction ah [07:55] fireworks are bad this is terrible and [07:58] now they're even more afraid so make [08:00] sure if you are going to use a [08:01] correction to stop a behavioral issue [08:03] that a puppy is performing it cannot be [08:05] a behavior that is based on fear this is [08:08] incredibly important but again if it's [08:10] something like chasing cars you do want [08:12] to correct that because you don't want [08:13] your puppy to run into the street if [08:15] your puppy is constantly getting into [08:17] the trash can I correct that as well I [08:19] don't want the puppy to get something [08:20] out of the trashcan that is dangerous [08:22] that the puppy ends up eating and it [08:24] causes a ruptured bowel or a blockage or [08:26] something like that that could be very [08:27] very dangerous to the puppy so this is [08:29] okay to correct a dog during that [08:31] portion in the dog's life if it's for [08:33] behavioral issues that are potentially [08:35] life-threatening obedience I'm not gonna [08:37] correct them when they're a puppy so [08:39] they're not going to have the perfect [08:40] sit stay they're not going to have the [08:42] best down stay they're not going to be [08:43] perfect at their obedience because [08:45] there's no consequence if they don't do [08:48] it my puppy is definitely food driven [08:50] when it comes to training however he [08:51] does like to play tug with me [08:53] how do I translate tug as a reward this [08:57] is a great question I like to use toys [08:59] when I train any dog but I want to make [09:02] sure that I can get the dog to first do [09:04] the behavior it's very difficult to [09:06] teach a dog new behaviors using a toy we [09:08] first teach the behavior is using either [09:10] luring or leash pressure and it should [09:12] actually be called leash cue because [09:14] we're using the leash to cute the dog [09:15] into a specific behavior we would like [09:17] them to perform once I have a dog that [09:19] I'm working with performing all the [09:21] behaviors on the verbal command alone [09:22] then I will start to reinforce the [09:25] behaviors using a toy if you're going to [09:27] use a toy you have to make sure anytime [09:29] you Mark a behavior and you're going to [09:30] reward with the toy you need to use your [09:32] terminal marker so if I told my dog to [09:34] lay down I want to reward my dog with a [09:36] ball on the rope when I use the terminal [09:39] marker my dog can jump up and we can [09:41] play with the ball on the rope and we [09:42] can have a good time I wouldn't want to [09:44] use my continuation marker and then try [09:46] to reward the dog with a toy because [09:48] they're supposed to stay in that [09:49] position and it's gonna be very [09:50] difficult to maintain the down stay at [09:52] the same time playing with the toy so [09:54] once you have your dog doing all the [09:56] commands on the verbal alone so you can [09:58] say sit boom your dog sits down boom [09:59] your dog lays down then you can go ahead [10:01] and you can start instead of pointing [10:04] out a treat you could pull out a toy you [10:06] can play tug and then you can tell your [10:08] dog to out and go right back into the [10:10] training so you want to make sure that [10:11] your dog understands how to play with [10:13] the toy and you also want to make sure [10:14] that you can get your dog to release the [10:16] toy when you tell them to drop it or out [10:19] I use the word out so I tell my dog out [10:21] and then we go right back into training [10:23] so you have to have that control in [10:24] order to use the toy during your [10:27] obedience routine how do you teach a [10:28] puppy not to jump on the couch it's [10:30] supposed to be a safe place for my older [10:32] dog but now the puppy jumps there too if [10:34] I want to prevent a puppy from going on [10:36] a certain specific piece of furniture [10:37] I'm gonna treat it and I'm gonna train [10:39] the exercise the exact same way I teach [10:41] a stay so I'm gonna make sure the puppy [10:43] understands leash pressure I want to [10:45] make sure the puppy knows their markers [10:47] so continuation marker terminal marker [10:49] and condition correction so that would [10:51] be our no or our sound that predicts [10:54] either negative reinforcement or [10:56] positive punishment when they're a puppy [10:58] my know always predicts negative [11:00] reinforcement which is leash pressure [11:02] I'm showing the dog what they need to do [11:04] I'm showing the puppy what they need to [11:05] do when I [11:06] say no so if I'm training a dog to do a [11:08] climb stay the moment the dog steps off [11:11] the climb when their paw touches the [11:12] ground I say one no pinpointing the [11:14] incorrect behavior I compliment the [11:18] leash I guide them back on the platform [11:19] good dog [11:21] if my dog goes to jump on the couch I [11:23] don't want my dog to jump on the couch [11:25] I'm gonna say one no the moment my dog [11:27] jumps on the couch I'm gonna walk over [11:29] grab the leash and I'm gonna use the [11:31] leash pressure today to take the dog off [11:33] of the couch and I'm going to do that [11:34] every single time my dog jumps on the [11:37] couch or my puppy that I'm training the [11:38] puppy jumps up no I walk over I use [11:41] leash so you're going to have to have a [11:42] leash on your dog or you can have a tab [11:44] a tab is just a much shorter leash that [11:47] you can have on your dog when they're in [11:48] the house so you can still use that [11:50] leash pressure without worrying about [11:52] the leash getting caught on the [11:53] furniture so the puppy jumps up again [11:55] you say one no you casually walk over [11:58] you pull the puppy off of the couch once [12:00] the puppies off the couch good puppy you [12:03] don't want to reward your puppy when you [12:05] pull them off the couch if you do then [12:07] your puppy might intentionally jump on [12:09] the couch so you pull them off the couch [12:11] and you give them a treat oh I jump on [12:13] the couch they pull me off the couch I [12:14] get a treat I jump on the couch they [12:16] pull me off the couch I get a treat so [12:18] if I'm having to reinforce a stay or I'm [12:20] trying to prevent a dog from jumping up [12:22] on a specific piece of furniture or [12:23] jumping up on people this works for that [12:26] as well when they jump up no I use the [12:28] leash pressure I place them where I want [12:30] them to be then I say good dog or good [12:32] puppy nice job I don't I do not give [12:35] them an actual reward once I take them [12:38] off of the couch because again they will [12:40] seek out that behavior to get the reward [12:42] my dog is so nosy when people come over [12:44] if it's someone he doesn't recognize he [12:46] will start to bark and want to jump at [12:48] them any suggestions on how to fix that [12:50] first I want to show the dog what they [12:52] need to do when somebody rings a [12:53] doorbell or somebody knocks on the door [12:55] I have to go through the training first [12:56] so I'm gonna have a friend or somebody [12:58] else in the house [12:59] knock on the door once they knock on the [13:01] door I'm gonna cue the dog onto their [13:04] climb command I like to direct my dog to [13:06] a climb command when somebody rings the [13:08] doorbell or somebody knocks on the door [13:10] it's very simple to teach and it's an [13:12] easy way to reinforce a commanded [13:14] behavior when somebody comes over to the [13:16] house so again somebody knocks I cue the [13:19] dog onto the [13:20] somebody rings the doorbell iq the dog [13:22] onto the climb somebody rings the [13:23] doorbell IQ the dog onto the climb I do [13:25] this over and over again until somebody [13:27] rings the doorbell [13:28] look my dog went over to their climb bed [13:30] somebody knocks on the door [13:32] look my dog went over to the climb bed [13:34] I'm going to rehearse what I would like [13:35] my dog to perform in that specific [13:37] situation then if you have a dog that's [13:41] nosy and is trying to see who's at the [13:43] door simply placed the climb in a [13:45] position where the dog cannot see who is [13:48] ever at the door if you're unable to do [13:50] that then what I would do is I would [13:52] correct my dog for barking or lunging at [13:55] the person who's coming over I would say [13:57] that's not an OK behavior if you do it [13:59] there will be a consequence I don't want [14:01] my dog to lunge at somebody because if [14:04] they keep doing that and the human [14:06] response the way most humans would [14:07] they'd be like oh my gosh this dogs [14:09] jumping at me and the dog sees that oh [14:11] look what I did eventually that can turn [14:14] into your dog biting somebody when they [14:16] come over and that is something you most [14:18] definitely do not want so what I would [14:20] do is I would have a leash on the dog I [14:22] would have a training collar on the dog [14:23] I would wait till the dog barked or [14:25] lunge I would say no and then I would [14:27] give the dog a leash pop so what a leash [14:30] pop is it's basically taking a leash and [14:32] then we're doing a snapping motion that [14:35] activates the dogs training collar and [14:37] it gives them a correction and if the [14:39] dog continues to do the behavior then [14:41] that means your correction is not high [14:42] enough and you have to correct a little [14:43] higher again this is important we don't [14:45] want to correct our dogs nobody gets a [14:48] dog because we want to correct them but [14:50] we also don't want our dog to bite the [14:52] neighbor's kid when they come over so we [14:54] have to correct that bait behavior out [14:55] of the dog's repertoire so again I went [14:58] through the dog barks or lunges the [14:59] moment they do it [15:00] no I pop the leash given the dog [15:02] correction the moment they stop doing [15:04] that behavior I go yeah good dog [15:05] excellent job and I do it enough times [15:08] to where the dog no longer thinks of [15:09] doing that bad behavior if I tell my dog [15:12] a command and he doesn't comply I [15:14] correct him then he will comply should I [15:17] then reward the dog or just go on to the [15:18] next command when I first start [15:20] correcting a dog this is the process [15:22] let's say I tell my dog to sit and my [15:25] dog chooses not to sit I say one note to [15:28] pinpoint the mistake I pop the leash [15:30] upwards giving the dog correction then i [15:32] recommand the [15:33] sit and then I help the dog perform the [15:35] sit by using the leash pressure once a [15:38] dog sits I reward them for that behavior [15:40] that's going to be in the early stages [15:42] but once I know my dog really really [15:44] understands the training we've been [15:46] doing it for a long time and there's [15:48] really not many mistakes taking place [15:49] anymore and my dog chooses not to do it [15:52] I'll give them a correction I'll make [15:53] sure they do the behavior and then I can [15:55] move on to the next one and the dogs not [15:57] going to get a reward so in the [15:58] beginning yes I will reward them but [16:01] after they've been training with me for [16:03] a while it's let's say six months into [16:05] training then they're not going to get a [16:07] reward after they received the [16:09] correction I'll go on to the next [16:10] command or the next exercise how do you [16:13] train a dog to have a more reliable [16:14] recall even when the dog is busy doing [16:17] something else if I want my dog to have [16:18] a very reliable recall I want to make [16:20] sure every time I call them no matter [16:22] what's going on no matter what [16:23] distractions or situation we're in i [16:25] reinforce the command if I need to use a [16:28] leash then I use the leash so I take my [16:30] dog to the park I call my dog to me I [16:32] use the leash I take my dog outside of a [16:35] dog park where there are a lot of [16:37] distractions I call my dog to me I use [16:39] the leash to reinforce it I take my dog [16:41] anywhere you name it we take the dog to [16:43] multiple different locations we [16:44] reinforce the command and we do it over [16:46] and over again to the point where our [16:48] dog doesn't even think about not [16:49] listening to us we say the command boom [16:51] the dog comes running over I talked [16:53] about this in one of my other videos [16:55] from my experience it takes [16:57] approximately six to nine months for a [16:59] dog to truly develop a very strong habit [17:03] and what I mean by that is they don't [17:05] even think about it they just do the [17:07] behavior for example if I'm working a [17:09] dog outside and my dog Ari is inside if [17:12] she hears me giving that dog commands [17:14] she will perform those behaviors inside [17:17] even when I'm not next to her so I tell [17:19] the dog outside to down my dog downs [17:21] inside the house I tells the dog outside [17:23] to sit my dog ari will sit inside the [17:25] house she'll still do the commands even [17:27] though I'm not directly telling her to [17:29] do it because I trained her so much that [17:31] when she hears a command she just does [17:33] it but again from my experience it takes [17:35] about six to nine months of consistent [17:38] training training them every day making [17:40] sure that every time you give them [17:41] command you follow through and that's [17:43] going to be the most important part [17:45] don't give your dog command if you [17:46] not ready to reinforce it how much and [17:48] how often do you feed your dogs daily [17:50] and for puppies how much should we feed [17:52] them my two dogs ari and Charlie I feed [17:54] them twice a day I feed them roughly 10 [17:57] to 12 ounces of raw food in the morning [17:59] and 10 to 12 ounces of raw food in the [18:01] II mean they're not that big for their [18:03] breed so Ari is a melon Juan she's a [18:06] very small Malinois Charlie is a lab and [18:09] he's a very small lab it's going to [18:11] depend on your dog it's going to depend [18:12] on your dog's activity level and when [18:14] I'm training or I'm raising a puppy I'm [18:16] not worried about how much they're [18:17] eating if I'm training them and they [18:19] keep taking the food I keep feeding them [18:21] a puppy usually is growing so fast that [18:24] you're not worried about them getting [18:25] fat when I was training Harley Harley [18:28] was eating roughly 6 cups a day that's [18:31] because she's growing now when she [18:34] becomes an adult when she's over a year [18:36] her metabolisms going to slow down and [18:38] the food is going to have to be reduced [18:40] she's not going to continue eating six [18:42] cups a day if you want to make sure [18:44] you're feeding your dog the right amount [18:45] of food weigh it then if your dog starts [18:48] to gain too much weight just reduce how [18:51] much you're feeding them if they start [18:52] to lose too much weight give them some [18:54] more food but if you want to know more [18:57] about nutrition canine nutrition I would [18:59] definitely recommend checking out the [19:01] documentary pet fooled and then check [19:03] out dr.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 3/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone today we are going to be [00:01] introducing the odor that we're going to [00:03] be using to teach in our dog scent [00:05] detection we're gonna be starting with [00:06] an exercise known as the field search [00:09] [Music] [00:19] the way we're gonna do this is I have a [00:21] bunch of tennis balls inside of these [00:23] plastic containers now the plastic [00:25] containers have the odor that I'm going [00:27] to be using to teach re scent detection [00:29] none of the odor is directly on the [00:32] tennis ball what I mean by that is I [00:34] didn't take the tennis ball and place [00:36] the odor on the tennis ball the odor is [00:38] on the lid and with the tennis balls [00:40] inside of the container it's going to [00:42] capture that scent we don't want to have [00:44] it directly on but what we're doing the [00:46] concept is this is a primary reinforcer [00:48] with the scent so she's going to start [00:51] associating the scent with the actual [00:54] reward and we're gonna be able to use [00:55] that to transfer over into our actual [00:57] scent detection routines that we're [00:59] going to be doing so I'm gonna show you [01:01] how we're gonna do this the first time [01:02] we do this step one is we bring the dog [01:04] out and we play fetch just like normal [01:06] but the only difference is before we [01:09] throw the ball we're going to say our [01:11] search command so I'm gonna be using the [01:12] word search so I'm gonna have the ball [01:14] in the chuckit I'm gonna say search then [01:16] I'm gonna throw the ball she's gonna go [01:18] grab it and bring it back so this is [01:20] step one every time I throw a tennis [01:22] ball once my dog brings it back I take [01:25] that tennis ball and I put it off to the [01:26] side I do not continue to use it because [01:28] when we throw it it's going to have a [01:30] bunch of new odors that are going to be [01:32] added to it so I want it to be as clean [01:34] as possible with the odor that we're [01:36] trying to teach our dog so step one all [01:38] we're going to do is we're going to play [01:40] fetch we're gonna tell our dog the [01:42] search command and then we are going to [01:43] throw the ball so it should look [01:45] something like this [01:46] search then I throw so she's gonna go [01:50] and get the ball grabbed it no problem [01:53] and she's going to bring it back I'm [01:54] going to take the ball from her and then [01:56] I'm gonna use a brand new ball with the [01:58] odor now we take the next ball and we do [02:01] the same thing make sure you save the [02:03] command before you throw the ball such [02:09] usually I'll do this for a couple days [02:13] really getting my dog used to and being [02:17] able to associate the odor with the [02:20] primary fine later when you start [02:22] teaching your dog scent detection when [02:24] we started doing the searches the [02:26] primary find is not going to be there [02:28] we're going to be using a condition [02:30] reward so this would be the same as our [02:32] markers the dog is going to get to the [02:34] odor there's not going to be a reward [02:36] there we're gonna use our terminal [02:37] marker and then they're gonna come to us [02:39] to get the reward [02:40] this is associating the smell with the [02:43] actual primary reinforcer which in this [02:45] case we're using the tennis ball again [02:47] we say the command then we throw the [02:49] ball such you see that she's now [02:54] starting to respond off of the actual [02:56] command search so I'm getting her used [02:58] to here in the word search and again [03:01] she's smelling the odor that we're gonna [03:03] be teaching her every time she goes to [03:05] retrieve the ball the second step in [03:07] this training is now instead of letting [03:10] our dog go and run and get the ball [03:11] right away [03:12] we are going to hold our dog back we're [03:14] gonna allow that frustration to build up [03:16] a little bit I'm going to throw the ball [03:19] once it stops moving I'm going to then [03:22] say search and then I'm going to release [03:23] my dog and what she's going to do is [03:25] she's naturally going to run to where [03:27] she last saw the ball and then she will [03:30] instinctively use her nose to find the [03:33] tennis ball let me show you how to do [03:34] that [03:41] such and then I release so again she's [03:46] gonna go to where she naturally saw it [03:48] last and she will start using her nose [03:50] so she's searching for it and the wind [03:57] is blowing this way so she is in the [04:00] actual scent cone so she grabbed us so [04:02] that's a scent cone that's created from [04:04] the actual odor that she ran into and [04:07] that guided her to the tennis ball all [04:10] right we're gonna do this again [04:11] remember we have to make sure that the [04:13] ball stops moving before we release our [04:16] dog [04:19] so I say the search command and she [04:23] takes off so that one she was able to [04:26] see it and she ran directly to it I'm [04:29] gonna try to throw it a little bit [04:30] farther on the next one we're gonna do [04:32] one more of this step and then we're [04:35] gonna move on to the next step so I'm [04:37] gonna bring re back to me re hold the [04:40] collar [04:43] search and then release all right so you [04:48] can see she's running to where she last [04:50] visually saw it okay she picked it up [04:51] pretty quickly this time and ran [04:53] directly to it so now we're gonna be [04:56] moving to step three and what we're [04:58] doing is we are taking the ball with the [05:00] Oder we're throwing it out into the [05:01] field we're waiting until it stops [05:03] moving we spin our dog and then we give [05:05] them the search command so we're gonna [05:07] do this again with re taking a brand new [05:09] ball with the odor [05:16] and we send them off so you're gonna see [05:19] she's gonna be searching for the odor [05:23] and you have to make sure when you're [05:26] doing scent detection that you have a [05:28] dog that has a lot of perseverance [05:30] meaning they're willing to continue to [05:32] work in order to find the odor a lot of [05:37] dogs so she found the scent cone boom [05:40] right to the tennis ball but some dogs [05:43] will give up so when a police department [05:45] or military working dogs working dog [05:48] trainers are searching for a dog to do [05:51] bomb detection with or drug detection [05:54] with they want to find a dog that has a [05:55] very high level of perseverance a dog [05:57] that's not going to give up very easily [05:59] so if you have a dog that does tend to [06:02] give up easily this is going to be a [06:03] little bit more difficult for you the [06:05] more perseverance your dog has the more [06:07] they're going to be willing to work in [06:09] order to get that reward so we're going [06:11] to do this one more time with Ari [06:13] alright so this is the last one of this [06:15] she's starting to get a little bit tired [06:17] so I really wouldn't be able to do much [06:19] more anyways in this one we're gonna [06:20] give her a break and then we're gonna do [06:22] the very last step step four of our [06:25] field search training [06:28] search and then off she goes again she's [06:32] going to use her nose once she can no [06:34] longer see it that one she went right to [06:37] it so she was able to use her eyes but [06:40] the other one she was using her nose [06:41] very last step step four this is where [06:44] we're going to place tennis balls in the [06:46] field we're gonna bring our dog out and [06:48] then we're going to give our dog the [06:50] search command so we're not going to be [06:52] throwing the tennis balls this time [06:53] we're simply going to send our dog out [06:55] into the field in order to find the [06:57] tennis balls that we have placed there [06:58] without our dog scene and it's really [07:01] cool because you're gonna see your dog [07:02] go out and they're going to [07:03] instinctively use their nose and once [07:05] they find the item we praise and reward [07:07] them this is again going to help our [07:09] dogs start associating the scent with [07:12] the reward so let's go ahead and jump in [07:14] and do step four all right we're ready [07:16] to do our very last step I've placed [07:18] multiple tennis balls out into the field [07:21] I'm going to take my dog re and I'm [07:23] going to give her the search command [07:25] allow her to run out and hopefully be [07:28] able to find the tennis ball there's [07:30] about four maybe five tennis balls that [07:33] I've placed out there with the odor we [07:35] want our dogs to be successful so if I [07:38] send her out and she doesn't go or she [07:40] comes back then I'm going to walk out [07:43] into the field with her just to help her [07:45] out a little bit I'm not exactly sure [07:47] how she how well she's going to do on [07:49] this but like I said if your dog doesn't [07:51] go out or if your dog goes out and comes [07:53] back just walk out into the field with [07:55] them and they will be sure to follow you [07:57] and start searching for the reward so it [08:00] should look something like this I'm [08:02] going to give her the command re search [08:05] and then I'm gonna walk out there with [08:07] her so she went into the center position [08:10] and so she's not just going out so I'm [08:13] gonna walk with her and you may have to [08:17] do this the first time such I gave her [08:21] the command again so now she's going out [08:23] a little bit more on her own and as you [08:30] can see she's using her nose she's using [08:32] a combination of smelling the ground and [08:35] smelling the air boom she found one good [08:37] girl very nice so I'm gonna give her the [08:40] command again re [08:41] search and she needs a little help so [08:45] I'm gonna walk with her search you can [08:49] repeat the command if you like good [08:58] search [09:25] right there was excellent you can see as [09:28] she was walking she caught the odor and [09:31] immediately went to the source and [09:34] that's what we want to see that's [09:35] showing us that our dog is starting to [09:38] use their nose in order to find the [09:40] primary reinforcer with the odor that [09:42] were teaching our dog now she's a little [09:44] bit more tired than the ideal training [09:47] situation for this exercise so when you [09:50] do this exercise this should be fresh [09:52] you come out you have everything set up [09:54] your dog is fresh your dogs not tired [09:57] like Arya's because we've done all the [09:58] other exercises this is for [10:00] instructional purposes only do each step [10:04] within one or two days don't rush it [10:06] take your time with this if you have a [10:09] big yard at your house you can also do [10:11] this training at night where you throw [10:13] the ball into a dark field and your dog [10:15] will have to use their scent in order to [10:17] find the primary reinforcer so I'm gonna [10:19] give her the command to try and find [10:21] another one I want to give her one more [10:22] win and that's gonna be an excellent [10:23] session for today are you such and I'm [10:27] gonna walk with her just to help her out [10:28] a little bit she's tired good girl [10:38] now the wind died down so we're not [10:41] getting as much of a scent cone there we [10:47] go and she got another one [10:48] good girl Larry and I'm gonna let her [10:52] play with that one we might hang out for [10:54] a little bit out here she likes it but [10:56] that's a great training session make [10:57] sure when you're doing this your dog [10:59] enjoys the toy that you're using you say [11:02] the command before you throw the ball in [11:04] step one you say the command after the [11:06] ball stops moving in step two you say [11:09] the command after you spin your dog in [11:11] step three step four you have the items [11:14] placed in the field you bring your dog [11:15] out and you give them that search [11:16] command if they need a little bit of [11:18] help [11:18] no problem walk with them the same way I [11:20] did the more you do it the more your dog [11:23] is going to understand the concept of [11:24] this training exercise and when you get [11:26] it to a point where you bring your dog [11:27] onto the fielding tum search and they [11:29] run out and they find that toy then you [11:31] know you're ready to move on [11:32] to the next step I hope you

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 6/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back guys in today's episode we [00:01] are going to be doing the third step to [00:03] scent detection I'm going to be adding [00:16] the odor today I have it placed in a [00:17] small container in this container there [00:20] is a cotton ball with a drop of the odor [00:22] we're going to be teaching our dogs and [00:23] I'm going to place it inside of the one [00:27] cinderblock and then I'm going to add a [00:31] primary reinforcer the actual treat I [00:36] have my dog on another climb platform [00:39] I'm going to give her the command and [00:42] then I'm going to allow her to go to the [00:44] other platform and retrieve her reward [00:46] she's going to associate the reward with [00:49] the scent creating that positive [00:51] Association and then we're going to add [00:53] another cinderblock so it should look [00:55] something like this such good girl very [01:01] nice and then I'm gonna bring her back [01:04] to the other client pet platform this is [01:09] good it's taken her a second so she's [01:10] becoming more used to the scent I climb [01:15] now when your dog goes and retrieves the [01:19] reward out of the cinderblock or [01:21] whatever container you decide to use you [01:23] can mark it if you like but it's not [01:26] necessary on the step because once she's [01:28] doing the behavior that we want she's [01:30] getting the primary reinforcer so she's [01:32] making the connection but if you want [01:36] you very easily could do this such free [01:41] so I marked the behavior and now she's [01:44] able to get the reward once she eats the [01:46] reward then she's done doing the [01:47] behavior re [01:48] climb care baby good girl [01:52] alright so we're gonna do one more [01:57] search [01:59] good girl and now I'm gonna grab another [02:02] cinderblock now the next step is we are [02:05] going to add another cinderblock we're [02:07] gonna put another container inside of [02:09] the other cinderblock but this one does [02:11] not have an odor we have to make sure [02:13] that we make the picture look exactly [02:15] the same the only variable that is [02:17] different is the odor or that's what [02:19] it's going to eventually transition to [02:21] right now we're still going to put the [02:23] food in the container that has a primary [02:25] reinforcer or that has the odor rather [02:27] but then later the foods not going to be [02:30] in there we're going to use the terminal [02:31] marker and our dog is going to have to [02:32] come to us in order to get the reward so [02:38] this is the one with the odor this is [02:40] the one without the odor I'm gonna [02:43] pretend like I'm putting food in both [02:45] containers even though I only put food [02:51] in the one with the actual odor search [02:58] good girl so she went in the one that [03:01] did not have the odor there's no reward [03:03] only the one that has the odor this is [03:06] very important [03:07] hurry very good so we're gonna do it [03:11] again acting like we're putting food in [03:15] both containers such good girl very nice [03:25] again she's getting the reward directly [03:28] where the odor is that we're trying to [03:29] teach her and if she goes in the other [03:32] one there's no reward good girl [03:34] very nice sorry hi I climb alright so [03:42] now we are going to move these [03:58] same thing search good girl Ari very [04:03] nice excellent [04:18] one more time [04:26] such good girl very good excellent [04:33] nice job Ari good girl now we're ready [04:37] for the next step on this step the food [04:39] is not going to be inside of either one [04:42] of them but when she places her head [04:44] inside of the correct cinderblock with [04:47] the odor I'm going to use my terminal [04:49] marker and then reward her so it should [04:51] look something like this I'm still gonna [04:52] act like I'm putting food in search [04:59] three good and I dropped one on the [05:03] ground free free free free free and now [05:19] you can see she's not even going to the [05:21] other one anymore [05:21] oh of course once I say it she's free [05:23] she does but there's no reward on that [05:27] one free good girl [05:29] free good free excellent good job re [05:36] free good now we're gonna move them [05:39] around again [05:48] act like I'm placing food in each one [05:50] and again we're only gonna mark and [05:55] reward when she places her head into the [05:57] correct center block such free free good [06:08] free free free free very good ari come [06:21] here baby [06:22] climb excellent okay now I'm going to do [06:28] the exact same thing that I just did [06:30] with the cinder blocks with the bucket [06:31] the only one I'm not going to do this is [06:33] the boxes because the boxes I have are a [06:35] little too big for her to stick her head [06:37] all the way down and get the reward but [06:39] we'll be able to do it on this as well [06:40] as the bucket so let's go ahead and do [06:42] that so we're going to do the exact same [06:43] thing we just did with the cinder blocks [06:45] but we're going to be doing it now with [06:46] the buckets so I'm going to place the [06:48] reward inside of the bucket with the [06:50] Oder and I'm going to give my dog to [06:52] command [06:52] search good girl very nice she's getting [06:57] the reward while she is picking up the [06:59] odor re alright so we would do that a [07:03] bunch of times now we're going to add [07:04] the other bucket now we're going to be [07:06] adding the second bucket without the [07:09] odor the nice thing about the buckets [07:11] it's a little easier to move around then [07:13] with the cinder blocks and we're going [07:14] to act like we're putting food in both [07:16] containers and then we're going to give [07:21] our dog the command search good girl [07:27] excellent re [07:28] good job come on be very nice and I like [07:34] using the other climb platform because [07:35] it makes it easier to set up what I'm [07:37] doing you don't have to worry about your [07:39] dog watching you it's fine in the [07:40] earlier stages later on when they become [07:42] a little bit more advanced you don't [07:44] want them to watch you and I will show [07:45] you that in my future videos so again [07:47] act like we place the Oder in both act [07:51] like we place the reward in both [08:00] such good girl excellent re very good [08:07] come on climb okay so you're gonna want [08:12] to do that a few times more than a few [08:15] depends on your dog now we're going to [08:18] not have the food inside of the [08:20] container but rather use our terminal [08:22] marker once our dog does the behavior [08:24] that we want with the correct container [08:26] with the odor so I'm still going to act [08:29] like I'm putting food in both and then [08:31] I'm going to tell her to search free [08:36] good girl [08:42] free free very good re free free free [09:00] excellent job okay now I'm gonna bring [09:03] her back over here alright climb and [09:08] that's going to be the third step that I [09:11] like to do when teaching my dog scent [09:13] detection I hope you guys enjoyed [09:15] today's video let

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 9/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everybody welcome back to another [00:01] training video today's episode is going [00:03] to be the next step in my scent [00:05] detection dog training series just like [00:17] everything we do in dog training we [00:19] always want to keep in mind the concept [00:21] of predictability we're going to be [00:23] using that while we're training our dog [00:25] in this step in the scent detection [00:27] process before doing this you want to [00:29] make sure your dog knows the markers if [00:31] you don't know what a marker is check [00:32] out these videos where I explain and [00:34] demonstrate exactly how you could teach [00:36] your dog the concept of marker training [00:38] which is very important when we're doing [00:39] scent detection now we're going to be [00:41] using all three containers today the [00:44] cinder block bucket as well as the boxes [00:46] and we're gonna have them laid out in [00:48] three different formations one a [00:50] straight line the next one a circle and [00:53] the last one they're going to be [00:54] elevated this is going to help our dog [00:56] become generalized to the training [00:58] meaning they're gonna start [00:59] understanding that it's whenever they [01:01] find the odor is when they're going to [01:03] receive the reward [01:04] anytime I'm doing scent detection I do [01:06] continual reinforcement meaning every [01:08] single time my dog gets to the odor my [01:11] dog is going to receive the reward now [01:13] during this step we're not worried about [01:15] our dogs indicating on the odor but [01:17] rather getting to the odor once they get [01:19] to that odor we are going to mark and [01:21] reward we're gonna do this every time [01:22] while changing the odor to different [01:24] locations throughout the training [01:26] process this is going to help build our [01:28] dog's confidence showing them that every [01:30] time you get to a container with an odor [01:32] you're going to receive a reward it's a [01:34] very simple concept next training [01:36] session it's gonna be a little bit more [01:38] in-depth as far as getting our dog to [01:40] realize they need to stop and they need [01:42] to indicate on the odor but in today's [01:44] session all we're going to be doing is [01:46] making sure once our dog gets to the [01:48] container with the odor we are going to [01:49] use their terminal marker and allow them [01:51] to come get the reward with Ari I'm [01:53] gonna be using food as a reward however [01:55] you can also use toys the reason why I'm [01:58] choosing not to use toys during this [02:00] training exercise with Ari is because [02:02] she gets so amped up for a toy that I [02:05] don't want her to become tired too [02:06] quickly which is going to reduce the [02:09] amount of repetitions that I'm able to [02:10] get in this training session all right [02:12] guys so let's go ahead and jump [02:13] right in now when I do this exercise I [02:16] simply give one search command and I'm [02:19] going to point to my dog to show which [02:21] container I want my dog to search into [02:23] so what some trainers will do is they [02:25] will say the search command on every [02:27] single container me and they'll say it [02:28] no point they'll say it and they'll [02:30] point they'll say it and they'll point I [02:32] like to say it one time and then I'll [02:35] point to the first one once my dog [02:37] starts the behavior then I simply just [02:39] continue the physical queue like alright [02:42] come on baby he'd go climb then I simply [02:45] just continue the physical queue up [02:47] until my dog gets to the one with the [02:50] odor the moment my dog gets to the [02:52] container with the odor [02:53] I'm gonna use my terminal marker and [02:54] reward this is a very simple exercise [02:57] when our dog gets to the one with the [02:59] odor you don't have to get really [03:01] excited and try to get the toy out [03:02] within a second that was something that [03:05] would throw off students that I trained [03:07] with in the past they would get to the [03:08] one with the odor and they would try to [03:09] get the toy out or the food out really [03:11] fast now in this example I'm gonna be [03:13] using food the reason for that is my dog [03:16] gets so amped up for a toy that if I was [03:18] to use a toy she's gonna wear herself [03:20] out very quickly and we're not gonna be [03:22] able to do that many reps so I'm gonna [03:23] be rewarding with food so the moment she [03:26] gets to the container that has the odor [03:28] I'm gonna use my terminal marker which [03:30] for me it's fr EE and then she's gonna [03:32] come to me and get the reward I'm not [03:34] gonna go beyond the one that has the [03:37] odor so when our dogs get better and [03:39] they start to really understand the [03:40] concept let's say the odor is in this [03:42] one which it is I would continue to [03:45] point to the next one to make sure my [03:47] dog knows to stay on the one with the [03:49] odor but in this early step or these [03:51] early stages rather I'm not going to do [03:54] that I'm going to wait till my dog gets [03:55] to the one with the odor and then I'm [03:56] gonna mark it a reward so it should look [03:58] a little something like this [03:59] such three good girl [04:07] very nice color then what I like to do [04:09] is I like to move it around so I'm gonna [04:12] take this one I'm gonna put at the very [04:14] last position and now I'm gonna do the [04:17] exact same thing search [04:23] see the girl very nice now I'm gonna [04:27] take it and move it to another position [04:31] make sure you know which one has the [04:33] odor so I have this one marked where I [04:36] can tell I know it has the odor just by [04:38] looking at it even though every single [04:41] one looks the same to my dog so this one [04:44] I have a little piece of tape that goes [04:46] across here that lets me know this is [04:48] the one with the odor so I don't mix it [04:49] up here we go we're gonna do it again [04:51] such great good girl now I'm gonna move [04:56] it again such free good and we'll move [05:08] it again such free very good re you can [05:17] see it's a very simple exercise and you [05:20] want to do this enough to build your [05:21] dog's confidence to where they know when [05:22] they get to the one that has the odor [05:24] that's when they're going to receive the [05:25] reward you want them seeking the [05:28] container with the odor that you're [05:29] trying to teach your dog so again very [05:31] simple exercise make sure you do enough [05:32] of these to build your dog's confidence [05:34] get them to understand it and then you [05:36] can move on to the next step with this [05:38] exercise I'm also going to be doing it [05:40] with the buckets as well as the boxes [05:42] the items that we introduce to our dogs [05:44] in the very first step of this training [05:46] so make sure you go through it with all [05:47] different items that's going to help our [05:49] dogs generalize the training and it's [05:51] going to make it much easier when we [05:52] start doing real-life scenarios so what [05:54] we're gonna do with this we have our dog [05:56] placed on a climb platform and one of [05:58] these containers has the odor so this [06:00] one right here has the odor each [06:02] cinderblock looks the same to our dog so [06:04] each one has a container inside of it [06:06] just like we showed on the other video [06:07] and this is the only one with the odor [06:09] so that's the only thing that separates [06:11] the one container with the odor from the [06:13] containers that do not have the odor [06:15] there's no visual difference so on this [06:18] one I'm going to be guiding my dog not [06:22] giving her an opportunity to run [06:23] wherever she wants I want her to figure [06:24] out the pattern that I'm gonna be [06:26] showing her in order to find the odor so [06:28] I'm gonna give her the one search [06:29] command and I'm going to guide her by [06:31] using the physical cue throughout the [06:33] process [06:33] gonna look something like this such see [06:40] good girl very nice and then I can give [06:44] her her reward now just like the last [06:46] video I'm using food however you can use [06:48] toys if your dog for first toys over [06:51] food do the exact same thing that I'm [06:52] doing right now but instead of bringing [06:54] out food you can use a toy so we're [06:57] gonna move this and I'm gonna do the [06:59] exact same thing that I just did such a [07:05] good girl very nice and we're gonna move [07:09] it again such she skipped that one think [07:23] good girl [07:25] climb try one more time see good girl [07:41] very nice climb let's move the container [07:46] she almost tripped me up a little bit on [07:48] that one [07:50] and now what you can do if you're [07:52] worried about your dog watching you you [07:54] can act like you're putting a reward in [07:56] each container so you can do this I call [07:59] it the little magic trick I act like I'm [08:01] putting food in each container and then [08:08] when I get to the last one I go oh it's [08:11] in one of them Clym making sure I got [08:23] the right one okay sit see good girl all [08:31] very nice all right we'll go to the very [08:35] first one [08:35] sometimes when you're teaching this if [08:38] you don't set the odor in the first [08:41] cinderblock or the first bucket whatever [08:43] it is that you're using your dog may [08:45] skip the first one so it is important to [08:48] set it in the very first position as [08:50] well we really want to rotate it around [08:52] and have the odor be in every single [08:55] different position that you could place [08:56] a cinderblock such C good girl sick wait [09:06] good girl excellent job all right come [09:09] on baby [09:15] search free good girl [09:25] search free very good re climb [09:33] search [09:39] free very nice excellent I hope you guys [09:43] enjoyed today's training session let me [09:45] know what you think about it in the [09:46] comments below also certain things that [09:48] I

Is it just to get the dog accustomed to sticking their noses into different containers? 01:00 - I have a 6-month old Malinois who is very eager to learn. I tried doing the first step by introducing the box, but she was so focused on me she wouldn’t stick her nose into the box. Any suggestions? 01:43 - What if you have a dog that doesn't get excited over fetch. Could you try a different way? Like driving them into a hide with food? 02:27 - Is this the same process you would use to teach search and rescue? 03:51 - How would you deal with a dog that gets so excited to get that tennis ball they would run through a wall to get it?

I noticed you touched the ball with your hands at the end of the video. Will that affect any scent the next time you go to use the balls to practice? I notice when trainers use dowels (each one numbered) it's their own scent they put on the ONE dowl and the rest is handled with tongs. 09:45 - How does this relate to the first scent detection lesson? Should we be using the same command ""search"", to indicate that we want the dog's nose in the box? 10:36 - Any tips on increasing the dog's ball drive? 11:20 - Is it possible to begin formal scent detection training when the dog is around 9months old or should I wait till it is older? 12:02 - Is it better to teach them a bunch of scents upfront like in a kit? Or once you teach them 1, can they more easily learn the next scent? Website: https://www.nateschoemer.com/ Follow me: Instagram: http://instagram.com/NateSchoemer Facebook: http://facebook."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 13/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everybody welcome back to another [00:01] episode on my channel in today's video [00:03] I'm gonna be answering some of the [00:05] common questions that have been asked [00:07] about my scent detection dog training [00:08] series just like all my videos you can [00:11] find your question in the description [00:13] below and jump to that section in the [00:15] video so let's go ahead and dive right [00:17] in I'm a bit unclear on some of the [00:29] steps of this video why are you starting [00:32] with a cinder block and moving on to a [00:33] bucket and then a box is it just to get [00:35] the dog accustomed to sticking their [00:37] nose into different things yes that's [00:39] exactly right when I'm doing scent [00:40] detection training I like to use [00:42] different containers because it helps my [00:44] dog become more generalized to the [00:45] training so it's going to make it easier [00:47] when we transfer the training over to [00:49] real-life scenarios I have a [00:51] six-month-old Malinois who is very eager [00:53] to learn I tried doing the first step by [00:56] introducing the box but she was so [00:57] focused on me she wouldn't stick her [00:59] nose into the box any suggestions when [01:02] you're doing the fix shaping exercise [01:03] the idea is to get your dog to do the [01:05] behavior without helping them with a [01:07] physical cue however this could be a [01:09] difficult step for a lot of dogs when [01:11] we're first teaching it if the dog [01:13] doesn't naturally go place their nose [01:14] into the container if they don't [01:16] investigate it then we can help them out [01:18] I may be pointing to the container or [01:20] you can even place food inside of the [01:22] container to entice your dog to place [01:24] their nose into it and then get the [01:26] primary reinforcer for doing the [01:28] behavior some dogs will do it naturally [01:30] instinctively just like Ahri did in the [01:32] video some dogs might need a little bit [01:34] more guidance and that's completely okay [01:36] to do during the step to get your dog to [01:38] do the behavior what if you have a dog [01:40] that doesn't get excited over fetch [01:41] could you try a different way this is [01:43] going to be for the second step in my [01:45] scent detection dog training series if [01:47] your dog doesn't like toys then you [01:50] could skip this step or if your dog [01:52] prefers a different toy then you can [01:54] play with them with a different toy so [01:56] for example let's say your dog really [01:58] enjoys those doggie stuffed animals that [02:01] people buy from the pet store if your [02:03] dog likes that you can place the scent [02:04] on it and simply play with that with [02:06] your dog during the filled search [02:08] exercise and then when you're ready to [02:10] hide it into the field the dog is going [02:12] to look for that toy [02:13] the toy that they enjoy and when they [02:15] find it they are associating the smell [02:17] with the primary reinforcer or you can [02:20] simply skip this step and go to the [02:22] third step in my scent detection dog [02:24] training series is it the same process [02:26] you would use to teach search and rescue [02:28] center section training tracking for [02:30] competitive obedience search and rescue [02:32] they're all going to have a different [02:34] training process even though the dog is [02:36] using their nose when I've trained [02:38] search and rescue I treat it like hide [02:40] and seek what I do is I will have [02:42] somebody hold my dog and then I will run [02:45] away from my dog teasing my dog with a [02:47] toy and then I will hide behind a tree [02:49] or something pretty close by maybe [02:51] thirty yards or so give or take and then [02:54] once I hide behind the tree then my [02:56] helper will release the dog my dog will [02:58] run to where they saw me last and then [03:00] if they don't find me right away they [03:02] will instinctively use their nose and as [03:05] they become better at it and more [03:06] confident we simply increase the [03:09] distance the dog will always run to [03:11] where they last saw you and then they [03:13] will instinctively use their nose and [03:15] like I said we continue the distance and [03:17] then we continue the time duration from [03:19] when we take off to when the dog is [03:21] released they must have a high level of [03:24] perseverance to continue the search even [03:26] if they don't find the person right away [03:27] and that person Ference will increase as [03:30] long as the dog has done it multiple [03:32] times before with success that's why we [03:35] increase the distance and the time [03:37] overtime as a dog gets better at the [03:40] training exercise I am gonna be putting [03:42] up a series on search and rescue so you [03:45] guys will be able to see that firsthand [03:47] how would you deal with a dog that gets [03:48] so excited to get a tennis ball that [03:50] they will run through a wall to get it [03:52] this is great if I have a dog that is [03:54] really motivated for a toy that's going [03:56] to actually make it easier for me to use [03:58] that tool as a motivating factor to get [04:00] my dog to do the behavior this is what [04:02] competitive dog trainers look for they [04:04] look for the dog that's willing to eat [04:06] your hand off to get the food that will [04:07] do anything to get the toy that you have [04:09] the more the dog wants what you have the [04:12] easier it is to get them to perform the [04:14] behaviors so if I have a dog that has [04:16] really high toy drive then first I still [04:19] want to do my obedience re for example [04:21] has really high toy drive and when I'm [04:23] teaching the behavior is I'm using food [04:25] and then I want to make sure I can have [04:26] control [04:27] the dog when I'm playing fetch or I'm [04:29] using a toy [04:30] during my obedience training that means [04:32] I want to make sure I can teach my dog [04:34] an out command a reliable out command so [04:37] when I'm working with them I can reward [04:38] them with the toy [04:39] once I'm done allowing them to play with [04:41] the toy I could tell them to out put it [04:43] back in my pocket or my vest and go [04:45] right back into training if you don't [04:47] have a good out yet then you wouldn't [04:49] want to use toys in your obedience [04:51] training because you're gonna be [04:52] spending so much time trying to get the [04:54] dog just to release the ball so you can [04:56] go back into training and if that is the [04:58] case then check out my video on how to [05:00] teach a dog out and once you have that [05:02] out then you can start using it in this [05:05] training or in this step in the scent [05:07] detection series and you should be able [05:09] to get some really nice results do you [05:10] use dowels with re to practice scent [05:13] detection I noticed you touched the ball [05:15] with your hand at the end of the video [05:17] will that affect the scent the next time [05:19] you use the balls to practice I notice [05:21] when trainers use dowels each one [05:23] numbered it's their own scent that they [05:25] put on one dowel and the rest is handled [05:27] with tongs what you're describing is [05:29] what they do in a few different [05:30] competitive sports but the one that I'm [05:32] familiar with is the AKC utility routine [05:34] that's the top level that they do in the [05:36] AKC obedience and there's a bunch of [05:38] different exercises within that [05:40] obedience routine one is the scented [05:44] retrieve where they will place a bunch [05:46] of dowels out I believe eight or [05:48] something like that and you'll have one [05:49] in your pocket you'll hand that to the [05:52] evaluator or the judge they will place [05:55] it in the pile of all the other dowels [05:57] you'll be facing the opposite way so you [05:59] or the dog will not see the dowel with [06:02] the odor on it that should have your [06:04] odor on it then you have to turn around [06:05] and send your dog to retrieve that doubt [06:08] and if they retrieve any of the other [06:09] ones then they fail you have a process [06:13] that you have to do in order to get the [06:14] dog to learn this there's different ways [06:17] of teaching this the way that I taught [06:18] this because I did the AKC utility [06:20] routine I didn't do it through the AKC [06:22] it was one of my requirements when going [06:24] through the tommrow school master course [06:26] and I had two dolls one had my odor the [06:29] other one did not the one that did not [06:31] have the odor I had a string attached to [06:34] it and that string was attached to a [06:36] back tied to prevent my dog from being [06:38] able to retrieve it once I had a really [06:40] good [06:40] retrieve command on my dog I would send [06:42] my dog to go retrieve the dowel that had [06:44] my odor and if my dog grabbed the one [06:47] that did not have the odor I would use [06:48] leash pressure to bring my dog back and [06:50] it would slip out of my dog's mouth so [06:52] my dog would be unable to retrieve the [06:55] one that did not have my odor and then [06:57] when my dog picked up the one that had [06:58] my odor I would praise her and then when [07:00] she would finish finish the exercise [07:02] then we would do it again once it got to [07:04] the point where my dog was no longer [07:06] grabbing the dowel that did not have my [07:08] odor then I would add a third doll both [07:11] of those would be back tied to prevent [07:13] her from bringing them to me and the one [07:15] that had my odor on it would not be back [07:17] tied so then if she grabbed the wrong [07:19] one again I would pull her towards me [07:21] and if it was the wrong one nose back [07:23] tight it would slip out of her mouth and [07:25] I would recommand the retrieve so then [07:27] she would go back and when she grabbed [07:29] the one that had my scent on it the [07:31] correct one then she was able to bring [07:32] that to me and again as your dog gets [07:34] better with that you start to increase [07:36] or you start to add more dolls up into [07:39] the point where you have eight or nine [07:41] dolls and only one that has your scent [07:44] is the one that your dog can retrieve [07:46] and I did that I think for about a month [07:50] maybe two weeks to a month something [07:52] like that I don't remember the exact [07:53] amount of time and I had it to the point [07:55] where for two weeks every single time I [07:57] sent her to go retrieve my doll she [08:00] would not grab any of the other one she [08:02] would pick up the one that had my scent [08:04] and once I got to that point then I [08:06] would start doing it without the the [08:08] dolls being back tied there are other [08:10] ways of teaching it but that's the [08:12] technique that I used and it worked [08:13] really well I may make a video on this [08:15] in the future you also asked about my [08:18] hand touching the ball at the end during [08:20] the field search I'm really not worried [08:22] about the cross-contamination because [08:24] when I'm throwing the tennis ball it's [08:26] so far away from me that when my dog is [08:28] finding the primary reinforcer I'm not [08:31] even close to the the item so it's not [08:34] something that really affects the [08:36] training when I first did this I would [08:39] use just normal toys I wouldn't even use [08:40] the tennis balls and I would handle the [08:43] toy and throw it and play with my dog [08:45] and I was just creating that positive [08:47] association with the odor and the [08:50] primary reinforcer which is the toy now [08:53] another question [08:54] people have been asking is whether or [08:56] not they can reuse the tennis balls [08:59] after the training has been completed [09:01] yes you can so I put it back into the [09:03] container and what I like to do is I [09:05] will go to a local coin laundry and I [09:08] will wash the tennis balls at the coin [09:10] laundry those washing machines and [09:13] dryers tend to work a little bit better [09:14] than the ones I have back at the house [09:16] they do a great job they get most of the [09:18] odor out once I have the balls then I [09:20] bring them back I resent the container I [09:23] place the balls back in the container [09:25] and I let them sit in there and then I [09:27] will use those again the next day and we [09:30] can do this however many days we feel [09:31] necessary in order to get our dogs [09:34] understanding that if they find that [09:36] odor they will find the primary [09:38] reinforcer how does this relate to the [09:40] first scent detection lesson should we [09:42] be using the same command search to [09:44] indicate that we want the dog's nose in [09:46] the box so my second step in the scent [09:48] detection training is just to create [09:50] that positive association with the odor [09:52] and the primary reinforcer and it also [09:55] gives us an opportunity to start [09:56] teaching our dog this search command we [09:59] know if our dog enjoys toys that when we [10:02] throw a tennis ball our dog is going to [10:04] go get it so I can now use this as an [10:06] opportunity to start teaching my dog the [10:08] search command so I say search then I [10:10] throw the ball now my dog is starting to [10:12] understand when I say search there's [10:14] something for my dog to find so when we [10:16] go forward to step three and we say [10:18] search our dog will naturally respond to [10:21] it because we've done these two steps [10:22] before so to answer a question it helps [10:25] create that positive Association it [10:27] teaches the dog the command search that [10:29] we use once we start having them search [10:31] in the container such as the cinderblock [10:33] bucket or box any tips on increasing the [10:36] dog's ball drive I talked about this in [10:37] some of my other videos it's an exercise [10:39] that is known as dry building you place [10:42] your dog on a back tie if I'm trying to [10:44] increase my dog's tennis ball Drive or a [10:46] ball drive then I'm going to get a ball [10:48] on a rope and I'm going to tease my dog [10:50] with that while my dogs on a back tie [10:52] once my dog shows enough interest then I [10:54] reward my dog with the toy if my dog [10:56] lets go the toy I pull it away and I [10:58] tease the dog a little bit more teasing [11:00] that what that is going to increase the [11:02] frustration which is going to increase [11:04] the dog's drive but that's the general [11:05] idea we use [11:07] raishin we use a back tie to tease the [11:10] dog and then reward the dog when we see [11:12] enough frustration which will naturally [11:14] increase the dog's drive is it possible [11:16] to begin formal scent detection training [11:18] when the dog is around nine months or [11:20] should we wait till he's older you can [11:21] start scent detection training at a very [11:23] early age one of my good friends he's a [11:25] dog trainer with a police department and [11:27] he does all the scent detection training [11:29] or he's the primary dog trainer with [11:31] their unit and he will start imprinting [11:33] a puppy on scent detection training when [11:36] I went through the Tom Rose school for [11:38] professional dog trainers my dog passed [11:40] all the scent detection requirements [11:42] when she was only 7 months of age so she [11:44] did a building search vehicle search and [11:47] a garage search you can start them at a [11:49] very young age and get really nice [11:51] results and if you imprint them on it [11:53] then they are going to be even better at [11:55] scent detection when they get older is [11:57] it better to teach a bunch of scents up [11:59] front like in a kit or once you teach [12:01] them one can they easily learn the next [12:02] scent yes what a lot of dog trainers do [12:04] is they'll do what's known as a cocktail [12:06] they'll have a bunch of odors together [12:07] and they will teach the dog five odors [12:09] at one time and the dog is able to [12:11] separate those odors when they smell [12:13] they won't smell one odor like we would [12:15] they would actually smell all five [12:17] separate odors so then when you separate [12:20] them and the dog gets two now just one [12:22] odor they would still indicate if you [12:24] did the training correctly what I've [12:25] always done was I will teach the dog one [12:28] odor once we teach them one odor it's [12:30] very easy to teach them new odors for [12:32] example one of the dogs that I trained [12:34] once she learned her first odor I was [12:36] able to teach her four new odors in one [12:39] day because they understand the concept [12:41] and when they get to that new odor they [12:42] go is this something that can give me a [12:44] reward and they indicate and you go yes [12:46] that is something you can get a reward [12:48] for and they go okay great and then they [12:50] start to indicate on that odor now [12:52] you're gonna have to do a few reps to [12:54] really increase that confidence but it [12:56] is very easy to add new odors when you [12:59] have one odor talk to your dog I hope [13:01] everybody enjoyed today's video let me [13:03] know you think about it in the comments [13:04] below please hit that like button that [13:06] subscribe button and that notification

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 16/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] everybody welcome back to another [00:01] episode in my scent detection series in [00:03] today's episode we are going to be [00:05] teaching our dogs how to indicate when [00:08] they find the correct odor this is a [00:20] very simple process the way that I like [00:22] to do it is simply show the dog what I [00:24] want them to do when they find the odor [00:26] again we always want to keep in mind [00:28] that concept of predictability this [00:31] process is very simple what I'm going to [00:33] do is I'm going to go through the normal [00:35] routine that I would when I'm doing [00:36] scent detection but when she gets to the [00:39] odor instead of using the terminal [00:41] marker and rewarding her right away I'm [00:43] going to tell her to do the behavior [00:45] that I would like her to perform when [00:47] she finds the odor that we're trying to [00:49] teach so for me I'm using the word down [00:52] or the command down once she gets to the [00:54] third Center block that has the odor I'm [00:56] going to tell her down then I'm going to [00:58] use the terminal marker this will start [01:00] to teach our dogs that when they get to [01:02] the odor they need to lay down which [01:05] will then predict the release and the [01:07] reward it's very simple it should look [01:09] something like this [01:10] such chunks free very nice good girl re [01:18] and then we take our dog and we bring [01:21] them back to the platform and then we [01:23] rotate so I noticed that she just [01:26] skipped the first cinder block or maybe [01:29] it was a sunken one but I'm gonna move [01:31] it to the very first position if she [01:32] goes right past it then we're gonna have [01:34] to reset switch down free very good so [01:40] she went right to it which was excellent [01:42] come on re-plug move the cinder block [01:47] again sit down very good re climb very [02:06] nice alright we're gonna move it one [02:08] more time I'm gonna keep it close [02:14] same exact thing such down breathe good [02:21] girl [02:24] very nice sorry hi again when you're [02:29] doing this exercise you want to do it [02:31] where you have the line up with the [02:32] cinder blocks then the buckets then the [02:34] boxes you want to do in the circle [02:36] formation as well as the elevated [02:38] platform again helping our dog become [02:40] more generalized I'm going to do one [02:41] more with the line up here I'm gonna [02:44] make her work for this one we're gonna [02:45] put it all the way in the back then I'm [02:50] going to show you guys the next step [03:01] good job okay so you want to do this for [03:09] a good amount of time you want to get [03:10] your dog really understanding that when [03:12] they smell the odor you're then going to [03:14] tell them to down they're gonna lay down [03:16] then they're going to hit the terminal [03:18] marker they're gonna jump up and they're [03:20] gonna come over and they're going to get [03:21] the reward remember the concept of [03:23] pattern recognition predictability [03:25] meaning if they start to notice a [03:28] pattern then by default they'll do the [03:31] behavior without you having to command [03:33] them so right now of course we're [03:34] telling our dog what we want them to do [03:36] we're saying when you get to that odor [03:38] that I want you to lay down I'm gonna [03:41] help you out in the beginning by telling [03:42] you this so instead of confusing our [03:45] dogs it makes it very simple for them to [03:47] start realizing that you want them to do [03:49] that behavior which will become the [03:51] indication for our search or scent [03:54] detection so now the next step after [03:57] you've done it with all the different [03:58] locations the elevated and the circle [04:01] formation then what you want to do is [04:03] you're going to get to the container [04:05] that has the odor you're going to tell [04:08] your dog to do the behavior that you [04:10] want them to do as the indication but [04:12] instead of using the terminal marker and [04:15] rewarding them right away you can use a [04:17] little bit of verbal praise if you want [04:19] so we're gonna work on the duration all [04:21] continue to pretend as if we are [04:23] searching because we want our dogs to [04:26] get to a point where when they get to [04:27] the odor no matter what the human does [04:29] they know that we want them to indicate [04:31] and maintain that position this is very [04:34] important and this is how we're going to [04:35] do it you have to make sure you have a [04:37] good commanded position and your dog [04:39] knows a state all right so I'm going to [04:43] move it forward because it's going to be [04:44] hard to demonstrate this it was on the [04:46] very last position and again so now I'm [04:50] going to look once we get to this one [04:52] I'm gonna give her the command to lay [04:54] down then I'm going to continue to move [04:56] to the other cinderblocks til I get to [04:58] the very end hoping that she maintained [05:00] that she maintains the position then I [05:02] will come back and reward her should [05:05] look something like this good girl [05:17] three very nice and then if you want [05:21] your dog to look at the odor or look [05:25] where they found the odor then what I do [05:27] is I just wait till they look back or [05:29] you can repeat the command to search and [05:31] then the dog will look back to where the [05:33] odor was and you can mark and reward [05:35] some trainers like the dog to continue [05:37] looking at the odor the entire time [05:39] until they're given the release one of [05:42] the best ways to do that is to get a PVC [05:45] tube cut a hole in the back and then [05:48] that way you can actually reward through [05:50] that hole so you can get your dog to [05:51] look at the reward free and then you [05:54] could give it to them when they're able [05:55] to take their head out and they learn to [05:57] keep their face looking at it so that is [05:59] an option if you want your dog to [06:00] maintain focus on the location where [06:03] they find the odor but I really like to [06:05] do this technique I'm going to show you [06:06] again search done so she continued to [06:14] follow that happens bring her dog back [06:18] and try again down [06:25] good search three so you see a right [06:29] there when I said search she looked back [06:32] into the center block showing me that [06:34] that's where it was now you're also [06:36] gonna run into the problem where a dog [06:38] is going to do what's known as a false [06:40] indication she did it a couple times [06:42] right in the front she just laid down [06:43] she goes can I get a reward on this one [06:45] okay how about this one then she gets [06:48] through the one that actually has the [06:50] odor and that's where she gets the [06:50] reward if your dog starts to do a false [06:53] indication don't get worried about it [06:55] don't become stressed out just continue [06:58] to do the pattern don't reward the dog [06:59] when they indicate on the wrong odor or [07:01] when they indicate when there is no odor [07:03] all right we're gonna do it again we're [07:05] gonna move it to another position all [07:11] right here we go such dumb [07:20] so she wouldn't past it so again we're [07:23] going to swing back around which is [07:24] gonna happen [07:41] very nice sorry [07:43] so I had a recommand it one more time to [07:45] help her out again getting her to put [07:47] her nose back into the muzzle and you're [07:49] seeing we're hitting a few speed bumps [07:51] here and this is going to be common [07:52] she's getting frustrated she wants to [07:54] get the reward very quickly she's trying [07:56] to indicate on cinder blocks that don't [07:58] have the odor and she's also skipping [08:00] cinder blocks so what we want to do it [08:03] they start to skip we block them from [08:04] being able to move forward this is why [08:06] I'm using a leash right now I want her [08:08] to make sure she searches every single [08:10] cinder block so we're gonna do another [08:11] one up at the front position we're gonna [08:16] see if she's gonna go past it switch [08:24] down [08:31] very good re [08:33] such very nice good girl [08:44] great give her another reward [08:47] excellent work all right again start by [08:51] once they get to the odor tell them the [08:53] commanded position you would like them [08:55] to perform as their indication use your [08:57] terminal marker and then reward them [08:59] when your dog becomes more confident and [09:01] you've done it in multiple different [09:02] exercises as far as the circle formation [09:05] the elevated formation as well as the [09:07] straight line formation then get it to [09:09] the point where you're saying the [09:11] command once they get to the odor and [09:13] you continue to walk as I demonstrated [09:15] in this video and you want to keep doing [09:16] this up into the point where when your [09:18] dog gets to the correct odor even though [09:20] you don't say anything [09:22] they still indicate and they do the [09:24] behavior correctly let's see if Ari is [09:26] good enough to do that right now [09:36] Search Search 3 nice job [10:12] very good so you can see she's starting [10:16] to understand the concept she's not [10:18] there 100% yet she went by a few times [10:20] she questioned herself and you're gonna [10:22] see that with your own dogs but the more [10:24] you do this exercise the more your dog [10:26] is going to understand it the more [10:27] confident they're going to become and [10:28] the more clear the behavior will be and [10:30] you'll have a dog that knows how to [10:32] indicate on the odor that you're [10:33] teaching them now while doing this [10:34] exercise you can also use toys as your [10:37] primary reinforcer if you prefer to use [10:39] that over the food [10:40] the way that I do that is I like to do a [10:42] little thing called the magic trick I [10:44] showed you guys this before with the [10:45] food but we can also do it with a toy so [10:47] with Ari I'm going to use her tug toy [10:50] and I'm gonna act like I'm hiding it in [10:53] each container so in order to do this [10:56] I'm going to release her from the climb [10:58] break down place her and do it down [11:05] climb now I'm going to allow her to [11:08] watch to see what I'm going to do so I'm [11:10] going to take the toy and I'm going to [11:11] act like I'm placing it into the [11:13] container and then I'm bringing it back [11:14] and putting it in my pocket and then I'm [11:16] acting like I'm placing it back in the [11:19] pocket in the container pocket container [11:24] and then I come back the other way and [11:29] then once I get the last one will depend [11:40] on when you're going to reward them so [11:43] we'll do it where she gets to the [11:45] container I colored it down once I get [11:47] to the end and she maintains that [11:48] position I'll use my terminal marker and [11:50] allow her to come get the toy now also [11:52] when we're doing this we don't have to [11:53] get super excited and try to get the toy [11:55] out in one second all you have to do is [11:57] say your marker within one second of [11:59] them doing the behavior and then take [12:00] your time bringing out the toy so Jim [12:02] look I'll know something like this such [12:14] search free good girl oh this is going [12:31] to be the same way and you can do it no [12:33] matter what step you're in with your [12:35] scent detection training series you can [12:37] use a toy instead of food but just like [12:39] I demonstrated here remember you don't [12:41] have to get the toy out super fast it's [12:43] about saying your marker the moment the [12:45] dog gets to the odor zone let's say [12:48] we're at a more an earlier step in the [12:51] training then it would look something [12:53] like this [12:54] search free good girl see how like calm [13:02] and relaxed that is she knows she's [13:04] getting rewarded for finding the odor oh [13:07] damn very nice oh good girl [13:12] center very nice alright okay so that's [13:20] it very simple but really easy a nice [13:23] way to use toys to reinforce the [13:25] behavior you're trying to teach your dog [13:26] alright

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 19/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] alright everybody in today's video we [00:01] are going to be introducing the free [00:03] search to our dog this is where we give [00:05] our dog the search command and then we [00:06] wait for them to find the odor on their [00:08] own so we're not going to be pointing [00:10] and helping them out we're hoping they [00:12] can do the behavior independently and [00:14] once they get to the odor we're going to [00:15] mark and reward now you can do this as [00:17] we've done every other step in the [00:19] training so when they first get to the [00:20] odor use the terminal marker we're going [00:22] to build up their confidence as they get [00:24] better at that when they get to the odor [00:26] tell them to down or whatever your [00:27] indication is then use your terminal [00:29] marker and reward after that once they [00:31] get to the odor tell them to down and [00:33] make them hold it for a little bit of [00:34] time then use your terminal marker and [00:36] reward and then the last one is where [00:38] they get to the odor and they indicate [00:39] without you telling them to indicate all [00:41] right it should look something like this [00:43] and you can use toys or food during this [00:46] process search that right there is a [00:54] false indication so I'm not going to [00:56] reward our search it's another false [01:01] indication free very nice so that was [01:06] the correct one all right [01:10] remember if they're giving you false [01:12] indications you do not want to reward [01:13] those and again we can do the magic [01:22] trick where we show and we have the item [01:25] we place it in the container touch [01:42] another false on vacation search all [01:51] right search good girl [01:55] search free very good good girl very [02:02] good [02:04] oh nice good job re come why are ya huh [02:12] okay so we're gonna do the magic trick [02:14] we're gonna pretend like we're taking [02:15] her toy and we're going to place it in [02:17] the containers so each time I'm acting [02:22] like I'm putting in the container but I [02:25] also have to act like I'm going behind [02:26] my back on each one so the picture or [02:29] the demonstration is the same and then [02:32] it's gone we're gonna beat [02:46] good girl good search three very good oh [02:54] that's good [02:56] oh very good nice job I climb Oh No oh [03:04] good okay we're gonna move it one more [03:07] time and again you have to do a lot of [03:14] this in order to get your dog to [03:15] understand it's only the container with [03:17] the odor where they're going to receive [03:18] the reward now I haven't done as much [03:21] training as I would like to on this so [03:23] she's not as good as she should be but [03:25] the fact that she's indicating is [03:27] showing that she's starting to [03:29] understand the training concept she's [03:30] just trying to get the reward she hasn't [03:32] fully associated that it's the odor [03:34] that's getting her the reward and not [03:36] just thinking I knows in a container and [03:37] laying down okay [03:39] such [03:50] girl 3 nice job very good that was [03:58] really good good job out better all [04:09] right we're gonna do one more she's [04:11] starting to get tired but you guys were [04:13] able to see on that one she's starting [04:15] to realize indicating on the ones that [04:17] do not have the odor does not give her [04:20] the same outcome as when the container [04:22] does have the odor so she's starting to [04:24] get it you guys are actually seeing it [04:25] in this video which is really cool a lot [04:28] of times people get frustrated or they [04:30] get worried they're like oh no my dog is [04:31] just doing a false indication on every [04:34] single block it's no big deal you just [04:36] don't reward them when they indicate and [04:38] they will stop indicating or they will [04:40] stop lying [04:41] when they're trying to just receive the [04:43] reward for sticking their nose in any [04:46] container and laying down we want it to [04:47] be the one with the odor [04:49] isn't that right Ari all right here we [04:53] go are you ready [05:03] great very nice Ari very good girl hi [05:11] and we're gonna do one more actually my [05:13] life Oh [05:15] go climb alright so this is a tough one [05:21] she went right to the owner and she [05:22] indicated so I'm gonna reward free good [05:25] girl oh good oh very nice note oh that [05:34] was cute all right so we're gonna put it [05:36] in the last spot and I'm gonna put it [05:38] right in front of her the reason why is [05:41] I want her to end on a very high note [05:44] meaning she doesn't right away she does [05:47] it correctly she gets a reward we play [05:49] it for a minute boom trainings done we [05:51] do it again tomorrow [05:53] so here we

gonna be teaching our dogs believe [00:03] it come in now I have Charlie here I [00:05] never taught him to leave it command [00:06] because I don't teach leave it to my [00:08] dogs I simply use the condition [00:10] correction which would be know if [00:12] they're going to do something that I [00:13] don't like however if you want to teach [00:15] your dog a leave it command which means [00:16] don't pick up what you're about to pick [00:18] up then this is going to be an easy way [00:21] to teach that what I like to do when I'm [00:23] teaching this exercise is I like to [00:24] place the dog on a back tie this is [00:26] going to help prevent any sort of human [00:28] error meaning I slip or I'm unable to [00:31] prevent him from getting the reward the [00:33] back tie is my insurance to make sure [00:34] even if I screw up we're not gonna mess [00:37] up the training exercise so I'm gonna [00:39] take a piece of food I'm using hot dogs [00:41] so it's big enough for you guys to see [00:42] and I'm gonna say the command then I'm [00:45] going to toss it we first start by [00:46] saying the command then toss in the food [00:48] so remember it has to be that [00:50] predictable pattern for the dog to learn [00:52] so we go leave it then we toss it so [00:56] he's doing great he's leaving it alone [00:59] and if our dog leaves it alone how he's [01:01] doing right here so he's thinking about [01:03] it good boy yes so once he does it [01:07] correctly I mark with the yes then I [01:09] grabbed the reward and I hand it to my [01:11] dog so now we're gonna try another one [01:13] again saying the command before we toss [01:16] the reward so now he's into it he got a [01:19] little taste of that hot dog which is a [01:21] special treat for him so I say leave it [01:24] and again the back tie is preventing him [01:28] from being able to get the item now if [01:31] he looks up at me yes I can reward him [01:33] with that now he's still trying to go [01:35] after it a little bit but you see he's [01:36] not going too hard after it because he [01:39] knows he has the back tie on so I'm [01:41] going to again pick up the reward and [01:43] hand it to him I like to show them hey [01:45] just cuz I tell you to leave it doesn't [01:47] mean you're not going to ever get the [01:49] reward you're still going to get the [01:50] reward I just want you to wait until [01:52] we're I'm ready to give you the reward [01:54] so again we're gonna do another one we [01:56] say leave it and then we toss and if he [02:01] looks at it yes and looks at me I'm mark [02:03] and reward so now there's another option [02:06] another known technique is where you can [02:09] cover it with your hand to prevent your [02:10] dog from getting the food or you can use [02:12] your foot [02:13] either option works I like to use this [02:16] again because for me and make sure I [02:18] don't make the mistake of not getting my [02:20] foot over the item before the dog gets [02:22] to it or not getting my hand over the [02:24] item before the dog gets to it once we [02:26] know our dog is doing pretty good then [02:29] what we can do is we can take off the [02:30] back tie we keep the leash any time [02:33] remember we're working with leash [02:34] pressure or at least as a cue if the dog [02:37] is doing what you want the leash needs [02:38] to be look nice and loose so Charlie's [02:41] going to be sitting and then I'm gonna [02:42] take the item and let's see how he does [02:44] leave it then I throw so he's going [02:47] right towards it and then he stopped [02:48] good boy yes so I say the marker I grab [02:54] it and I bring it to him okay so we're [02:57] gonna do another one and I want it to [03:00] where I don't have to stop him leave it [03:04] yes mark the behavior good boy very nice [03:09] now what if the item is already on the [03:12] ground and the dog is starting to go for [03:15] it in this same situation we can say [03:18] leave it as our dog is going for the [03:21] reward that's on the ground but then [03:23] preventing them before they get to it if [03:25] you do it this way which I do recommend [03:26] training this you have to make sure you [03:29] say leave it before you apply the leash [03:31] pressure if you are saying leave it as [03:34] you apply the leash pressure this will [03:36] not work so again all I'm gonna do is [03:39] I'm gonna take the food I'm going to [03:41] toss it and he already is starting to [03:44] figure it out but let's see if he's [03:46] gonna go for it if I just walk around it [03:49] leave it and then I prevent him from [03:52] grabbing it once he doesn't go for it I [03:55] make sure the leash is nice and loose [03:56] okay here we go [03:58] so I can get another hot dog slice I got [04:01] other treats in here that's not hot dog [04:05] buddy okay so here we go I'm gonna take [04:10] it toss it good boy [04:18] good yes nice job buddy he didn't go for [04:23] it there I'm gonna use some just normal [04:26] freeze-dry treats yes good boy all right [04:39] so we're gonna do another one now I'm [04:41] gonna show you the other technique as [04:42] well if you did want to use the hand or [04:44] the foot option all you do is drop it [04:47] let them see leave it then you would [04:50] cover it [04:50] preventing them from getting to it and [04:52] then once they're doing it nicely [04:54] they're not going for the reward then [04:56] you can say yes and give them the treat [04:58] by picking it up and handing it to them [05:00] I prefer to pick it up and hand it to [05:03] them because I don't like my dogs to [05:05] constantly be sniffing the ground trying [05:08] to get a reward so again this is a very [05:10] easy way to teach the leave it command [05:12] make sure when you first teaching it you [05:14] say leave it before you toss it once [05:17] your dog understands that concept then [05:19] you can have it to where you have [05:20] something on the ground your dog goes [05:23] for it and before they get to it you say [05:25] leave it and then you prevent them from [05:27] getting to it so a good way to do this [05:28] is set your dog up so right now it's [05:31] very clear that we're doing a training [05:33] exercise Charlie knows we're in the [05:35] middle of a training session and he's [05:37] happy about it but you also want to have [05:39] it to where it's in a normal situation [05:41] so I might set a piece of food outside [05:43] without my dog knowing then I go inside [05:47] i hook the leash on I come walking out [05:49] and then my dog sees the food as my dog [05:51] goes for it I say leave it then I use a [05:54] leash pressure to prevent my dog from [05:56] picking up the item once they stop and [05:58] they look at me then I go yes and then I [06:00] grabbed their reward and I hand it to my [06:02] dog so that puts them in situations that [06:04] are not so directly associated with a [06:07] training session it makes it seem more [06:09] organic and natural instead of something [06:12] very training like as this is okay so [06:15] very simple technique I hope you guys [06:18] enjoyed today's video let me know what [06:20] you think about it in the comments below [06:21] and I'll see you guys in the next one [06:23] thanks again [06:24] [Music]

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 26/841,[00:38] so without further ado please welcome [00:40] the one and only oscar mora [00:42] all right thanks for coming down buddy i [00:44] really appreciate it so first what i [00:46] would like to do is introduce you to [00:47] my audience tell them a little bit about [00:50] yourself your dog training experiences [00:52] where you learned how you've gotten to [00:53] where you started out to where you are [00:55] now [00:55] maybe even a little bit of your dog [00:57] training philosophies and principles [00:59] cool uh started dog training uh [01:02] around 11 years ago i got a connie corso [01:06] and i was kind of uh you know there was [01:07] all these stories going around of these [01:09] dogs that attacked these [01:11] two ladies up in san francisco and so [01:14] when i got this course so i had [01:15] never owned a dog before living at my [01:17] parents and [01:18] i was like stressed out because i was [01:20] you know i thought [01:22] this dog was going to be aggressive and [01:23] you know i didn't know anything about [01:24] dogs so [01:26] long story short got the dog i found [01:29] this guy that was doing shuts an [01:31] old old german dude before i got the dog [01:34] i found him [01:35] driving down to the freeway in the 405 [01:37] and i stopped by i was like hey pete [01:39] well [01:40] now that it knows now i was like hey i [01:41] want to learn about dogs and he was like [01:44] uh yeah you can come and hang out and [01:46] you know [01:47] see if uh if you know something you like [01:49] so [01:50] anyways fast forward uh six months later [01:53] i got my dog and i was there for six [01:55] months going every tuesday and thursday [01:57] to his uh trainings or whatever and he [02:00] would yell at me [02:01] uh you know he had a club yeah he had [02:03] like a little little shots in club [02:05] uh with a lot of show shepherds and [02:07] stuff like that [02:08] and uh so anyways uh fast forward i [02:12] i met uh this guy named steve garvin he [02:13] was into mondo ring [02:15] and he was training with a guy named oj [02:17] knighton [02:18] who i had already seen on cesar milan on [02:21] the [02:22] show and i was like oh yeah i know that [02:24] dude and he was like yeah you know [02:25] i give them your name call them and you [02:28] know maybe you can go out there and [02:29] see what they're doing and maybe you [02:31] could be into some of that stuff so [02:33] i called oj i got out there [02:37] and he put me in the suit first time out [02:40] never you know never been in a bite suit [02:42] threw me in the bite suit and uh [02:44] told me to run and sent this this mondeo [02:47] a [02:48] monty ring three dog on me named bogan [02:50] send them on me [02:51] freaking dropped me uh and that was it [02:54] was it a uh doberman it was a malinois [02:57] oh it wasn't yeah i was a malinois [02:59] he was a beast man and uh so anyways [03:02] i was hooked since then from there i [03:03] jumped into you know french ring [03:05] did french ring for a while uh i think [03:08] that's where i [03:09] really uh learned more of my decoying [03:12] abilities you know [03:13] and when you do frenching you gotta [03:14] learn how to move a certain way [03:16] and then i went back and got certified [03:18] in mondial ring [03:19] and then i got certified in uh shuts in [03:22] igp [03:23] uh so yeah that's kind of how the sport [03:25] thing happened [03:26] so your introduction into the dog [03:28] training world was [03:30] competitive protection sports correct [03:32] that is very interesting [03:34] correct i mean outside before that i was [03:36] really [03:37] i wasn't really into dogs i grew up in [03:39] the hood but i never had like my own dog [03:41] before you know before uh before my [03:44] connie corso [03:45] well it's really cool that the [03:46] foundation work that you have [03:48] in dog training is a competition sport [03:51] or protection sports in general [03:53] what people often don't realize is when [03:55] you train to the very top level which [03:57] competition obedience competition [03:59] sports that is the top level when it [04:01] comes to communicating with a dog [04:03] making sure your delivery is clear and [04:04] working together as a team [04:06] something i talk about quite often to [04:08] start there [04:09] it probably made everything else seem [04:12] very easy in a sense so like once you [04:14] started taking on [04:16] your pet clients and things like that [04:17] that obedience had to be [04:19] yeah i mean what uh what happened was [04:21] that i mean [04:22] what the guy the old german dude i [04:23] started with that was all pretty much [04:25] yank and crank [04:26] uh you know escape avoidance yeah escape [04:28] avoiding stuff and uh you know [04:30] however he did try to you know motivate [04:32] the dog a little bit and have [04:33] you know so explain what uh escape [04:35] avoidance [04:36] style training is i mean who don't know [04:39] you know [04:39] compulsion based you correct the dog [04:41] into doing whatever behavior [04:43] you want them to do you know you add [04:44] pressure until the dog does whatever you [04:46] ask and [04:47] you know you reward him when he does it [04:50] with relieving pressure [04:52] uh so he was still rewarding but he was [04:54] teaching the behaviors by using [04:56] compulsion which is [04:57] yeah corrections exactly it was a little [04:59] bit uh you know less of uh [05:02] teaching the dog how to work for him [05:04] more so hey you're gonna do what i tell [05:06] you to do [05:07] um however i i i feel uh very [05:11] i'm blessed to come in to get got into [05:14] dog training at a time where [05:15] you know learberg was putting a lot of [05:18] michael ellis stuff [05:19] out and and all that and i really you [05:21] know and since i got into mondo ring i [05:23] learned about [05:23] michael ellis because that's what he was [05:25] doing at the time [05:27] so i i found that um you know i really [05:29] liked his style with training and really [05:31] motivated me to keep wanting to learn [05:33] more about dog training rather than just [05:35] stick to what i first learned you know [05:38] being open-minded to new techniques and [05:41] new philosophies [05:42] so what is your dog training [05:43] philosophies and principles what [05:45] structure do you follow when it comes to [05:47] training a dog [05:48] regardless of what you're training them [05:49] for i would say the first thing is you [05:51] know [05:52] get a dog motivated figure out the dog [05:54] uh [05:55] what he likes and you know create a good [05:56] relationship that way [05:58] uh once you have a dog that wants to [06:00] interact with you and is motivated [06:02] to want to work for you it's very easy [06:05] sometimes to teach behaviors rather if [06:08] you're trying to get a dog to work for [06:09] you and try to get a [06:11] you know a dog to do things for you when [06:13] he's checking out all the time [06:15] it just doesn't work so for me the first [06:18] thing i want to do is make sure that the [06:20] dog is focused [06:21] and wants to work for me how how you [06:24] accomplish that there's different ways [06:26] i usually do it through food you know i [06:28] cut their food a little bit i bring in [06:30] you know higher value food you know [06:32] maybe like some raw meat mix it with [06:34] their kibble [06:36] and you know get them more into the food [06:37] that way and then [06:39] you know i move forward from there i [06:41] love that you talked about motivation [06:42] first because that's something i often [06:44] say as well [06:45] somebody's like i want my dog to do this [06:46] or i want my dog to do that well what's [06:48] motivating your dog [06:49] everything that our dogs do is based on [06:52] motivation [06:52] either motivated to access something [06:54] pleasant motivated to prevent something [06:56] unpleasant or the behavior itself is [06:58] motivating and i've seen it before where [07:00] there might be a photo or something like [07:02] that you've probably seen this as well [07:03] posted on social media [07:05] and it has a dog jumping up doing [07:07] protection training [07:08] but then it says something exactly [07:10] opposite of what has taken place [07:11] something like oh this is cruel [07:13] making a dog do this what people don't [07:16] understand [07:16] if that is somebody who agreed with what [07:19] was written on that photo for example is [07:21] they don't understand that when it comes [07:23] to training a dog for one of these [07:24] protection sports [07:26] the dogs often are bred specifically to [07:28] do this [07:29] sport that they're going to be trained [07:30] in and they love it right why would you [07:32] want to try to put all this time and [07:34] effort into a dog that doesn't like [07:36] to bite a bite sleeve or doesn't like to [07:38] do these obedience routines [07:40] when they're working with you or like [07:41] when your dogs are working with you i've [07:43] seen them they're so [07:44] happy they're so stoked to be out there [07:46] and training with you [07:47] that having that motivation to do it is [07:49] of course going to be way more fun than [07:51] a dog that [07:52] maybe just wants to sit on the couch all [07:54] day right what do you do with that [07:56] i mean but i think it could go both ways [07:57] too because there are some dogs that [07:59] aren't very fit for the sport [08:01] and people want to make them fit for the [08:03] sport [08:04] and you know and you it could be a [08:06] little unfair for the dog sometimes [08:09] so you know while you want that's why [08:11] you got to make sure that if [08:13] if your goal is to compete in a sport [08:16] then you're going to get the right dog [08:17] for it now [08:18] if you got the a dog already and you [08:20] want to fold them into them you know fit [08:22] them into this mold [08:23] and he doesn't fit you know what why [08:26] don't you just take that dog and put him [08:27] into something else [08:29] if you know unless you're gonna you know [08:31] something that that dog enjoys [08:32] yeah something that he enjoys doing you [08:34] don't have to do shuts and do ring or do [08:36] whatever maybe he likes dog diving maybe [08:38] he loves [08:39] getting to that you know so i think [08:41] that's another thing that people need to [08:43] you know be aware of um i know i've [08:46] talked about this in in other [08:47] you know interviews or whatever when i [08:50] got into the sport [08:51] and i mean i'm very i'm a very [08:52] competitive dude i i like to win [08:55] uh you know and [08:58] i got into dogs you know loving [09:01] the dog and it soon turned into [09:04] i want to compete i want to win i want [09:06] to get these titles [09:08] and what ended up happening is is uh you [09:10] know becomes a little bit of not so much [09:12] for the dog anymore [09:14] more about competition and that's [09:17] it's it kind of it was a downfall for me [09:20] um [09:21] until later on i realized you know what [09:23] like i'm getting into this like for all [09:25] the [09:25] you know the wrong reasons i need to go [09:27] back to where i started like just [09:28] because i enjoyed being around dogs i [09:30] didn't even know about training [09:31] i didn't care about training all i cared [09:33] about was the dogs because i love [09:34] hanging out with dogs [09:36] so um that's why i think it's very [09:38] important to enjoy whatever you're doing [09:40] just like the dog is going to be [09:41] enjoying whatever sport he's going to be [09:42] doing [09:43] for the dog not because of the sport [09:45] that you're going to get into [09:46] and i think we just went a whole nother [09:48] route that's cool [09:50] motivation so that's the first thing [09:52] that you focus on [09:53] is making sure you have something to get [09:54] the dog to want to do what it is that [09:56] you want them to do [09:57] and i'm sure this probably goes when [09:59] you're working with basic obedience or [10:00] you're working with some of your clients [10:02] and things like that [10:03] so if you have a dog and that dog is [10:05] really into treats of course you want to [10:07] use treats to train with them [10:08] or if the dog really enjoys toys then [10:10] maybe after they learn what they're [10:12] supposed to do now do you [10:13] teach any behaviors using toys or do you [10:15] use toys [10:16] often as i do as a reinforcer for [10:19] something the dog already knows [10:20] i like i like using i like playing i [10:22] like teaching a tug game from the [10:24] beginning [10:25] because i feel like you could uh teach a [10:28] lot of impulse control at a [10:29] higher state of you know arousal level [10:33] so [10:33] for me that's one of the main reasons [10:35] why i like using the toy can you teach [10:37] obedience with [10:38] of course you know if the dog loves that [10:40] toy [10:41] you know he's gonna be he's gonna do [10:43] things for that toy [10:44] so i think you could definitely use a [10:46] toy i know ivan [10:48] ivan balawanov uses a lot of tug and [10:50] that's how he teaches all his dogs [10:52] obedience he's one of the best [10:53] uh yeah he's not just shooting dog [10:56] trainer he's just one of the yeah one of [10:57] the best [10:58] dog guys around so um i think you could [11:00] definitely use you won worlds what [11:02] three times i have no clue but uh you [11:04] know definitely you know he's a standout [11:06] when it comes to you know dog sports [11:08] yeah right [11:09] this book is excellent yeah the shit's [11:11] in book yeah so [11:12] um anyways yeah so uh what were we [11:15] talking about [11:16] so next question that i have right when [11:18] it comes to working with our dogs a [11:20] common question that [11:21] my audience asks is when it comes to [11:24] rewards how much do you have to reward [11:27] how often and can you get to a point [11:28] where the dog [11:29] doesn't need any rewards and one of the [11:31] things that i find [11:32] fascinating about competition sports in [11:35] general [11:36] is that we're able to take a dog and [11:37] even though they learn the behaviors [11:39] through the primary reinforcer and of [11:41] course market training and things like [11:42] that [11:43] that you're able to take them out on the [11:44] field for let's look at french ring for [11:46] example [11:47] at the top level it could be 45 minutes [11:50] and the dog is out on the field what [11:52] steps [11:52] do you take to get your dog to the point [11:54] where you can take them out on the field [11:56] do an entire obedience routine not [11:57] reward [11:58] not correct in any way and still get the [12:00] dog to perform throughout the entire [12:02] exercise yeah i think that's a [12:04] very good question uh so i'm gonna go [12:07] back mike i had a connie corso his name [12:09] was ac slater [12:10] and i was doing mondo ring with them and [12:12] when i first started training i didn't [12:14] you know i didn't really know much about [12:15] it but i wanted to [12:16] you know do with food and motivation and [12:18] everything so when it came to training i [12:21] really i was very active [12:24] trying to get them to be you know active [12:26] for me and do [12:27] all this obedience for me so i would [12:29] like make noises [12:31] you know and come here and calling them [12:32] and using food and everything [12:34] and then when i got into competition i [12:37] realized that i didn't have all this [12:38] help [12:40] and he was a complete different dog [12:43] so what did i do wrong i made him [12:46] reactive to me being active right that's [12:49] how that's how he was working for me but [12:52] then when i [12:52] wasn't able to do that he didn't do it [12:54] so [12:55] now what i do is i teach the dog [12:58] i don't even show him that i have the [13:00] food like i prep everything i go out [13:02] i make the dog initiate everything he [13:04] pushes me [13:06] to produce that reward it's not the [13:08] other way around i'm not gonna be [13:09] pushing him you know to do all these [13:12] things for me and then i'm gonna pay him [13:14] nah he's gonna push me enough to the [13:16] point where [13:17] you know you know like you could do it [13:19] by barking so i just stand there he [13:20] looks at me yes i can pay him [13:23] eventually that turns into a bark now [13:25] you have a dog that's very active [13:27] and pushing you now he's going to work [13:29] for you [13:30] so you could bring something out in hope [13:32] so you want to create hope [13:34] in the dog so that you know so [13:37] when you go into competition he's [13:38] running on hope that at some point he's [13:41] going to get rewarded [13:42] and that's that opera conditioning he [13:44] doesn't know when it's coming [13:46] you know you've conditioned him that and [13:48] and i do it with my dog [13:50] that when a first saver comes on right [13:52] before comp like if you [13:53] if you watch me right before i go into [13:54] the competition field i take my first [13:56] saber out i put him on a sit [13:58] i put the first saber on that's been [14:01] charged a ton [14:02] he's been paid for that a ton he knows [14:03] that when that comes on we're training [14:05] we're working [14:07] boom i put it on it's a completely [14:08] different dog you're going to see his [14:11] you know dopamine levels rise up and [14:13] he's he could run on a hole [14:14] he could do a whole routine and how did [14:16] you charge them for something like that [14:18] this might be something that could be [14:19] very beneficial for people that are [14:21] training their own service dogs [14:22] you know where okay i got the vest on [14:24] now it's time to work how do you get [14:26] them charged to the first saver [14:28] which is for people that don't know [14:29] first saver is very similar to [14:31] a choke chain right yeah but it's it's a [14:34] little bit different yeah [14:35] and the dogs are allowed to wear the [14:37] first savers [14:38] and shut down and and shuts and in [14:40] ring you can't but [14:42] just like that you could also do it the [14:43] other way around where you take the [14:44] collar off [14:45] and now the game starts it's like a [14:47] light switch so [14:49] uh for ipo i would uh you know you have [14:52] the you have your [14:53] as a puppy you bring them out you're [14:55] about to get ready to work you put that [14:56] thing on [14:57] mark it pam right away put it on market [15:00] pam eventually you're going to put it on [15:03] you're going to wait for him he's [15:04] expecting the reward he doesn't get it [15:06] he looks at you [15:07] mark it pam and so on and so on you move [15:10] forward and forward until you have a dog [15:11] that's [15:12] he knows that when that thing comes on [15:13] it's it's you know business [15:15] training is business time and we're [15:17] gonna have a good time exactly [15:18] which is very important when it comes to [15:20] working with a dog and that's something [15:21] that i actually really like about the [15:22] evolution of the protection [15:24] dog training world or the sport [15:26] protection training is if you look at [15:28] some of the videos from a long time ago [15:30] the dogs weren't required in a sense to [15:32] be happy or to be motivated or to enjoy [15:35] the training [15:35] and this is how things have evolved over [15:37] time so now correct me if i'm wrong if [15:39] you go [15:40] and compete and should sin and the dog [15:43] does not look happy [15:44] and does not look motivated to be out [15:45] there then you it's basically impossible [15:47] to get a perfect score so put it like if [15:49] you [15:49] your dog could look happy in the whole [15:51] routine but if you're doing say a sit [15:54] out of motion if you tell him to sit [15:55] and his tail or his ears go back you're [15:59] losing a point [15:59] you're losing points so it's then it's [16:03] not even just the [16:04] like the healing it's the whole picture [16:06] they want it to look [16:07] like the dog is very motivated happy and [16:10] excited [16:11] happy and excited to be there if i mean [16:13] if the dog [16:14] and it sucks because some dogs it's not [16:16] that you've you know corrected them and [16:18] all that too much [16:19] some dogs just don't wag their tail the [16:21] same as other dogs [16:23] they're gonna lose points for that um so [16:26] you know it's kind of a [16:27] but yeah i mean they did they the [16:28] picture has to be the dog has to look [16:30] happy and enjoy the work [16:32] that's just you know number one when it [16:33] comes to schutzen and for shits in [16:35] that was created initially years ago i [16:38] don't remember [16:39] what the date was but it was to test the [16:42] integrity of the german shepherd breed [16:44] correct [16:44] i believe it was uh created for like uh [16:47] breeding purposes like if you you know [16:48] if you could do well in this [16:50] you know it's like a breeding test or [16:51] whatever i'm not you know 100 percent on [16:54] on all i haven't done [16:55] my i probably should study a little more [16:57] of where it started and everything well [16:58] to be honest i don't know for sure [17:00] either but i know that [17:01] uh like for example in germany if [17:04] somebody is breeding a german shepherd [17:06] it's almost expected that they have some [17:08] sort of title on the dog to show that [17:11] that particular line lives up to the [17:13] integrity of the breed and it's able to [17:16] do the job so if you're for example [17:18] competing with let's say a lab in [17:19] chitsen they consider that an off-breed [17:21] because it's not [17:22] the breed that was or the the [17:26] routine wasn't designed after a lab you [17:28] know same thing with french ring i'm [17:30] pretty sure french ring almost in a [17:31] sense is a breed standard right [17:33] for the malinois man i have i'm i'm [17:35] guessing that's what it is i think so i [17:37] think [17:37] i mean the thing and and again uh [17:40] you know different disciplines different [17:42] i mean [17:44] uh what's required in french training [17:46] what's required an ipo or two diff [17:48] i mean just oranges and apples you know [17:50] what i mean uh [17:52] so i don't really know what you know why [17:54] they created this [17:55] all i know is that i love i love the [17:58] sport and uh yeah so [18:00] and you compete and you decoy and all [18:02] that as well and decoying is [18:04] really an awesome fun thing to do but [18:06] it's also very intimidating [18:08] it could be intense yeah i mean it [18:10] depends like when i got into it [18:12] um i i was hooked from the beginning you [18:14] know i loved taking bites [18:16] um i especially when i got into french [18:18] ring [18:19] it was like you know because there it's [18:20] the decoy versus the dog and you know [18:23] you know when you got a little bit of an [18:25] ego uh what do you mean [18:27] decoy versus the dog i mean your your [18:30] job as a decoy is to take points away [18:31] from the dog [18:32] and you know when they're competing yeah [18:35] but i mean in training [18:37] i mean like when you're young and you're [18:39] not really looking at like the whole [18:40] training side of it and [18:42] you know what what's required to build [18:43] this dog all i was looking all i was [18:45] watching was videos on you know youtube [18:47] at the time and all they showed yeah all [18:49] these shows competitions so [18:51] i would go back and i would try to mimic [18:53] all these moves that these guys are [18:54] doing [18:55] um you know and that's that's why i [18:57] really liked it you know when you're [18:58] able to you have a dog coming at you [19:00] full speed and you can make a miss [19:02] and then he's coming back and you make a [19:03] miss again like i mean that that is a [19:05] good feeling yeah that is a good feeling [19:07] you know [19:07] so um i wasn't able to do that very [19:09] often i'm not as good in the suit as you [19:11] are [19:12] but yeah when the dogs would pass me [19:14] such a rush and then when they come back [19:16] to try to get another bite and you're [19:17] able to do a scoop [19:18] and prevent them from biting that's [19:20] another amazing rush but for me [19:22] nine times out of ten the dog would get [19:23] the bite on the entry yeah and then if [19:25] they passed me they would come back and [19:27] get it almost instantly so it would blow [19:29] my mind [19:30] watching some of these top decoys in the [19:32] world yeah and what they're able to do [19:34] and they're taking top level dogs [19:36] yeah yeah like when you like uh [19:39] i forgot what's happened but they're [19:40] like when uh when you're in france like [19:42] my buddy joe he goes [19:43] he went to france to like big he's like [19:45] every dog there [19:46] is like a top dog and these dudes the [19:49] decoys [19:50] they're not like like you know like me [19:52] that was like i was [19:53] you know i was at training every every [19:54] week now these dudes like [19:56] are training every day running it like [19:58] they literally run a lot like they're [20:00] they take it serious like a legit sport [20:03] you know i was doing it like on the you [20:06] know one [20:06] three times yeah three times a week and [20:08] these dudes are doing it [20:10] all the time and they're preparing their [20:12] bodies for this you know what i mean [20:13] and they're also working maybe 20 dogs [20:16] every day [20:17] 20 man i they have like 70 dogs probably [20:20] that they're just like running through [20:22] every [20:22] every single day like in france it's [20:24] like they say it's like huge like [20:25] there's clubs all over the place for [20:27] french rings so [20:28] yeah man they take it very yeah but like [20:30] you see like you know dosta [20:33] harvey muwanga like oh you know what i [20:35] mean like uh [20:37] what's this the other dude uh corvair [20:40] or whatever his name is like um you know [20:42] these dudes are like i remember when i [20:44] certified [20:45] in french ring i hope i'm not butchering [20:48] his name [20:49] this dude was running with us man this [20:51] dude was like a freaking like he could [20:52] run like [20:53] no problem and we were all struggling [20:55] this dude's like nothing [20:56] it's nothing yeah like there's nothing [20:58] i'm just like man this dude actually [20:59] takes it you know [21:00] very very serious it's kind of funny i [21:02] was watching some of the videos of these [21:04] top decoys and french ring from france [21:06] and i'm just blown away [21:08] blown away what they're able to do and [21:09] i'm watching all these videos i remember [21:10] someone says to me they're like so what [21:12] are you watching [21:12] i explain to them what i'm watching and [21:14] i said that's how good i want to be [21:16] and they're like keep working at it [21:17] you'll get there yeah no [21:19] no like well another thing is that these [21:22] dudes start [21:22] super young like you know it's part of [21:24] their you know that's part of what they [21:25] do [21:26] it's like me loving basketball and [21:28] watching michael jordan [21:29] and somebody being like keep keep [21:30] practicing you'll get as good as yeah [21:32] it's not gonna happen [21:33] not gonna happen those top level guys [21:35] the way that they do it they're like [21:36] black belt in the suit [21:38] yeah they're so good it just blows my [21:40] mind at how good they are yeah and [21:42] you're really good too you're way better [21:43] than me [21:44] and they're way better than you yeah [21:45] yeah no these are another level for sure [21:47] it's awesome so let's say i'm a new [21:50] client of yours coming down and i want [21:52] to train my dog to do protection [21:54] so not necessarily sport i just want my [21:56] dog to be a good personal protection dog [21:58] what is the first thing you do when it [22:00] comes to maybe evaluating determining [22:03] the dog's skin yeah i mean [22:04] you got it you got to make sure the dog [22:05] has a stable temperament first [22:08] uh that he's not like you know nervy and [22:10] like you know looking around worried all [22:11] the time [22:12] uh the last thing you want to do is [22:14] teach a dog like that how to bite [22:16] uh the other thing is you're going to [22:18] test the dog's drives see if he has some [22:20] prey [22:20] see if he has a natural aggression uh [22:23] and so on and so on go from there and [22:26] then you have to look at the handler are [22:27] they going to be able to handle a dog [22:30] that you know can be switched on and you [22:32] know have that aggression [22:33] so you got to take all these things in [22:35] consideration and see if it's going to [22:36] be [22:37] a good idea to teach this dog how to [22:39] bite [22:40] um i i usually tell people look you can [22:42] teach them as long as you have good [22:43] control of the dog [22:44] and the dog knows how to bark and you [22:46] know and he could he could look [22:48] intimidating [22:49] most people aren't gonna mess with you [22:50] but you know you always have those [22:52] clients they're like nah i want like to [22:53] go all the way through [22:54] and then it's a long road but you know [22:57] you got to [22:58] you got to assess all the situation [22:59] would you recommend that they do [23:01] sport then um no i [23:04] feel in my opinion that you know sport [23:08] and personal protection though they [23:11] could you know [23:12] some things could kind of mix together [23:14] but it's a complete different picture [23:16] you know like my connie corso in the [23:18] field was in [23:20] complete sport mode when he was behind [23:22] my fence he was always defensive and you [23:24] know [23:24] barking at everything and he was never [23:26] like that at the field so [23:27] it's you know it's a different scenario [23:30] right here we're at a sport [23:31] field and right here you're at home [23:33] taking care of my property [23:35] so you have to show them different [23:36] pictures so you recommend most people [23:38] they do want [23:39] some sort of personal protection dog [23:41] that more often than not it could be [23:42] better just to teach the dog how to in a [23:45] sense [23:46] act aggressive to be a deterrent and not [23:48] even necessarily teach the dog to bite [23:50] depending on the i mean [23:52] the thing is when you teach your dog how [23:53] to bite um [23:55] and he does bite somebody there could be [23:58] you know [23:59] it's a line building yeah it's a it's a [24:00] lie it could be a liability like you [24:01] could get a suit i have [24:03] i have a and even if he doesn't bite [24:05] somebody if he gets out and he barks [24:07] and you know the person falls and bumps [24:09] their head [24:10] that's it and if they you know if they [24:12] see that this dog was training [24:14] protection [24:15] you know you can get you get sued for a [24:17] lot of money so i had a [24:19] i had somebody uh what is it a private [24:22] investigator [24:23] he called me and he's like hey you know [24:25] i'm just reaching out [24:26] i know you trained this dog and i was [24:29] just wondering like what kind of what [24:30] kind of training you did with the news [24:32] acting on cool with me and i'm like [24:33] it's kind of weird that this dude's [24:34] calling me anyways i'm like you know [24:36] what i only had this dog for a couple [24:37] weeks i didn't do anything [24:39] any bite work with him i just did [24:40] obedience come to find out the dog bit [24:42] somebody [24:43] and this private investigator was trying [24:45] to track down everybody who worked with [24:47] this dog [24:48] to see who did protection with his dog [24:50] so they could go after [24:52] them for teaching this dog how to bite [24:55] and uh so i think it's a it's a big [24:57] responsibility [24:58] they're gonna try to go after the [24:59] trainer yeah anybody that like if you [25:01] taught this dog how to bite [25:02] they could come after you basically [25:04] that's interesting even if it's not your [25:06] dog and you're just [25:08] yeah you're the one that taught the dog [25:09] how to bite and this dog [25:11] uh got out and bit a kid so [25:14] i find it interesting that you talked [25:16] about the deterrent though because [25:17] that's something i often tell the people [25:19] who do want protection training [25:21] and they come to me and they're like i [25:22] would like my dog to be a protection [25:23] trained dog i have a family this time [25:25] the other [25:25] and i say off more often than not like [25:27] just teach the dog [25:29] to act aggressive when there is a threat [25:31] and if you're able to do that like you [25:33] just said [25:33] a few minutes ago more often than not [25:35] that's enough to get people to back off [25:37] yeah i mean dogs in general are one of [25:39] the biggest deterrents when it comes to [25:41] robberies and break-ins and things like [25:43] that [25:43] because even somebody trying to rob a [25:45] place they're going to choose a house [25:46] that [25:47] doesn't have a dog and they're going to [25:50] choose a house that is more often than [25:52] not empty people working all day they're [25:54] not home [25:55] so just by having a dog often that's [25:58] enough of a deterrent they bark they [25:59] make noise [26:00] and most people even if they're stealing [26:02] or they're crooks or whatever they don't [26:04] want to hurt a dog [26:05] most people like dogs so just having a [26:08] dog in general [26:08] so let's say you do have somebody comes [26:10] up he says all right great let's teach [26:11] my dog [26:13] a deterrent what process would you do [26:15] for something like that [26:16] give him the mailman treatment man i [26:18] mean literally you're gonna walk up [26:20] create some suspicion in the dog [26:22] the dog barks you go away the dog wins [26:25] little by little he you know he becomes [26:27] this like freaking monster that he you [26:29] know at least he feels like he is [26:31] and you know build him up that way uh [26:34] that's that's basically that's like the [26:36] the short you know the short side right [26:38] and that's [26:38] that's kind of funny that you'd say the [26:40] mailman too because that's something a [26:41] lot of people run into with their dogs [26:42] when they don't want them to bark [26:44] the mailman comes the dog barks the [26:46] mailman goes away [26:47] the dog goes oh look what i just did and [26:50] now it reinforces that behavior [26:52] so that's something that has ac that's [26:54] very common with [26:56] dog owners they don't really fully [26:58] understand the concept of predictability [27:00] or the concept of pattern recognition [27:02] when it comes to our dogs [27:03] so there is a certain pattern that the [27:05] dog is picking up on such as the mailman [27:08] leaving [27:08] they could assume that it's their own [27:10] action that's causing it and it can [27:11] strengthen that [27:13] that behavior right same thing with dogs [27:16] being taught to be aggressive now do you [27:19] get a lot of aggressive dog clients [27:21] i i do uh right now i'm at the point [27:24] where i [27:24] really like working with uh puppies [27:27] puppies [27:29] no i do i do get some with aggression [27:31] most of the time it's just fear [27:32] aggression [27:33] and you know it's just about building [27:35] the dog's confidence [27:36] and you know letting them know that you [27:38] know everything's going to be good [27:40] uh real real real aggression i don't i [27:43] to be honest with you i haven't dealt [27:44] with too much of that [27:45] yeah i don't see it very often either [27:46] that's what people don't realize either [27:48] that [27:48] like a dominant aggressive dog is very [27:50] rare yeah i think i've come across [27:52] two since i've been training dogs since [27:55] 2012 i've come across two dominant [27:57] aggressive dogs pretty much every single [27:59] other dog [28:00] it's fear aggression yeah now when you [28:02] have a client that has a dog that's very [28:03] fearful [28:04] what are some of the things that you do [28:06] in order to build the dog's confidence [28:07] this is a common question that a lot of [28:09] my [28:10] supporters and followers ask about i [28:12] think i mean [28:13] again you got to build some type of [28:15] motivation for the dog [28:17] and get them to want to work for you and [28:19] then put them in [28:20] in a different situation and get them to [28:22] want to work for you there [28:23] little by little build them up there's [28:24] different exercises you could do have [28:26] them climb over stuff just to build up [28:28] his confidence let them know everything [28:29] is all right [28:30] when he is trying to back off into you [28:32] know a spot [28:33] don't go over there and baby the dog and [28:35] let him know that it's okay that [28:36] everything [28:37] no we just you know make them follow [28:39] through with whatever you want them to [28:40] do [28:41] release relief the pressure um you know [28:44] and make them grow that way show them [28:45] different situations that's how i that's [28:46] how i do it i just keep [28:48] i just work them through things and let [28:49] them know everything's gonna be okay [28:51] so it's basically just building success [28:53] upon more success [28:54] so you start with something small [28:56] something simple the dog is successful [28:58] you reward them for that as they become [29:00] more confident then you make it maybe a [29:01] little bit more challenging [29:02] up until the point where they're fully [29:04] confident that's something i talk about [29:06] all the time where i'm like you know [29:07] it's not about having this submissive [29:09] dog [29:09] people want a submissive dog which [29:11] submission is better than fearful [29:13] you know i don't wanna fearful i'd [29:15] rather have submissive over fearful but [29:16] i'd rather have confident over [29:17] submissive exactly fearful [29:19] so once you get a puppy first thing that [29:21] you wanna start doing is [29:22] building the confidence building the [29:23] relationship what is the first thing [29:25] that you start doing with a puppy that [29:27] you're imprinting for [29:28] uh protection sport for a protection [29:31] sport i mean the first thing that i do [29:32] is i teach them you know [29:34] the markers that i'm going to use what [29:35] time do you what age do you start [29:36] training them [29:37] as soon as i get them eight weeks old [29:38] eight weeks about seven or six if you're [29:40] gonna yeah i mean if [29:41] if i usually you know i'm not a breeder [29:44] but [29:44] uh for example my buddy juan i got a dog [29:47] from him [29:48] and he was working him at six weeks old [29:51] by the time i got him the dog was like [29:53] you know he was on and he was a [29:54] completely different dog than like [29:56] somebody that just hands you an eight [29:57] week old puppy [29:58] so yeah you get them earlier you can [30:00] start them at six weeks uh i i start [30:02] them at eight weeks [30:03] uh when as soon as i get them and i [30:05] teach them the markers you know yes [30:07] and get it uh good teaching the place [30:10] like [30:11] little things like that just to come and [30:12] check in right off the bat though i want [30:14] the dog to [30:15] push me to produce a reward and how do [30:18] you get them to do that [30:20] in the beginning i just put him on leash [30:22] why on leash because i don't want him [30:23] roaming around [30:24] all over the place just so i could block [30:25] him just i'm out there [30:27] if he looks up at me or glances up at me [30:30] or anything i just mark it i say the [30:31] word yes [30:32] and i produce a reward once he sees that [30:36] i have something for him [30:37] then you know and i don't just give him [30:39] like one little piece of food [30:40] like i'll give him like one after [30:42] another after another [30:44] he's checked in he's like oh dang that [30:46] was you know that was pretty awesome [30:47] and then i could say get it and i could [30:49] toss another treat then i can go the [30:51] other way he goes he grabs that [30:52] he comes back because he wants more of [30:54] what i have that's how it starts [30:56] so get it for you is a terminal marker [30:58] or what exactly is that it's just like a [31:00] go get this treat [31:01] basically uh and i use it a lot to get [31:04] the dog away from me [31:05] uh more so like if i'm working fronts i [31:08] could go you know [31:10] here he comes good good good [31:14] yes i can pay him here and i say get it [31:16] i get him away from me [31:17] and then he's coming back and i can use [31:18] my queue again to get him to come in [31:20] front [31:20] so good is then you're you you kind of [31:22] do it very similar to a lot of other [31:23] trainers where good is your continuation [31:25] mark duration marker [31:26] duration marker and then your yes as a [31:28] terminal marker and then [31:30] get it as a terminal as well but it's [31:32] setting them away [31:33] exactly that's interesting i i like that [31:35] yeah so you have two versions in a sense [31:37] of a terminal marker yeah [31:38] so the dog knows when you use one that [31:40] means the reward is going to be on you [31:42] correct and when you use the other the [31:43] reward may be on the field [31:45] you do stuff like that for maybe working [31:47] on focus heel or something you have [31:48] maybe a ball out in the field [31:50] you always throw it yeah yeah so like [31:52] with wapo [31:53] instead of saying like get it it's [31:54] always when the toy is already [31:56] out there uh if i say go if i say go [32:00] that means i'm gonna grab my toy and i'm [32:02] gonna toss it [32:04] and so one is already in place one is [32:06] gonna get tossed [32:07] and then the other one is yes is with me [32:09] all the time [32:10] and so if you're gonna be so if i'm [32:12] healing like i always use in protection [32:14] because [32:15] if i call them out of the blind and like [32:17] it shuts in [32:18] call them out i could say yes and i can [32:21] paint with me or i could say get it and [32:23] he can go back and bite [32:25] so you always want to make sure you have [32:27] different options you're not just [32:28] if he always feels like the reward is [32:30] with the helper [32:32] then all that energy is going to go [32:34] there and it's going to be it's going to [32:35] be harder for you to contain [32:37] the dog next to you rather if he knows [32:39] that he can get something there [32:40] or he can get something with you now [32:43] he has different options and he's going [32:45] to be more focused on you because he [32:46] knows he can get something with you as [32:47] well as out there [32:48] and when do you start teaching the puppy [32:51] the bite works side [32:52] or when you start imprinting them on [32:53] that as soon as i get them uh you know [32:55] as soon as i get them i want to and [32:57] again it's all with the with the markers [32:58] so eventually you know you teach contact [33:01] heal that's going to go into your site [33:03] transport or your defensive handler for [33:06] french ring um you know if you're going [33:09] to be teaching the barking [33:10] i teach barking for activation to me [33:13] same thing he's going to be activating [33:14] the helper to produce [33:16] the sleeve or whatever you know so it's [33:19] it's all from the beginning the concepts [33:20] are all the same [33:21] if somebody has an older dog let's say [33:23] somebody has a dog that's a year and a [33:25] half [33:25] and they want to start getting into [33:27] these protection sports is that doable [33:29] at that age [33:30] 100 yeah as long as a dog is of course [33:32] interested in that type of training if [33:34] he has a genetic [33:35] for it yeah so when you are working with [33:37] a dog that's a little bit older do you [33:39] start the process the same way you would [33:40] with a puppy [33:41] uh depends on what they've been doing [33:43] already uh for sure [33:45] i i and it depends on the handle like on [33:47] the handler [33:49] if you feel that they have the capacity [33:51] to you know learn [33:52] that style of training then you could [33:54] break it down and teach them that style [33:56] some people are just not going to get it [33:58] that way and you got to make it as easy [34:00] as possible for them [34:01] so for them i would be like okay we're [34:02] going to place our reward here the dog [34:04] is going to be looking up here [34:06] when you're ready you're going to say [34:07] yes drop the ball and play play play [34:09] play it's it's a different style of [34:11] training but [34:12] it gets results as well so somebody that [34:14] is somewhere else in the united states [34:16] and they're interested in doing [34:16] protection training what would be your [34:18] number one advice to them [34:20] uh number one advice would be find a [34:23] club [34:23] that you know find a club that offers [34:26] that [34:27] or somebody that's knowledgeable uh in [34:29] the subject [34:30] and go from there get get your dog [34:31] evaluated and then go from there how can [34:33] someone find a club [34:35] uh i mean most organizations have a page [34:37] with a bunch of clubs listed [34:39] so now i'm familiar with the four at [34:41] least i feel like they're the four main [34:42] ones in the united states are there more [34:44] than i'm unaware of so i know there's [34:45] mario ring french ring [34:47] psa and then shits in which is now [34:50] called [34:51] igp igp what does that stand for i [34:53] thought it was ipo [34:54] and yeah it was ipo and then it turned [34:56] into igp i haven't everyone still knows [34:58] shit's in yeah so those are the four [35:01] that i know are there any beyond that [35:03] um i mean there's a other little ones [35:06] that you know popped up here and there's [35:07] there's one [35:08] ap pda my buddy ty in [35:11] new new york and new jersey uh he does [35:14] that [35:15] um then there's uh what was the other [35:17] one an adf or something like that [35:20] and it's you know similar stuff people [35:21] that you know try to make up [35:23] you know so there are a few others yeah [35:25] what are the main differences between [35:27] the four main ones [35:28] so if somebody was trying to consider [35:29] one do i do psa do i do french ring do i [35:32] do shits in [35:33] do i do manual ring what are some of the [35:35] differences between those that could [35:37] maybe influence someone to choose one [35:39] over the other [35:40] um i mean so [35:44] schutzen requires uh [35:47] more in my opinion more precision um [35:50] so they're they're you know the rules [35:52] are like they're they're very strict [35:54] uh you know your dog has to look a [35:56] certain way [35:58] um however for me if i feel like it was [36:01] the [36:01] is the easiest sport to train on your [36:04] own like you can do more on your own [36:06] and then you can get with the club or [36:07] with the with the decoy [36:09] and he could get you you know to the to [36:11] get your dog titled you still require a [36:13] team [36:13] but i feel like you can do a lot of it [36:15] on your own uh [36:17] french ring most the obedience you could [36:19] do it all on your own [36:21] but when it comes to protection [36:22] especially you want to get to the higher [36:24] levels you're going to need [36:25] a decoy that knows how to move a certain [36:27] way you could show your dog different [36:28] pictures knows how to teach pivots [36:30] do all that stuff um so i think that it [36:33] requires [36:34] a different you know more a better team [36:37] uh [36:37] when it comes to rings especially a [36:39] decoy uh same thing with a mondo ring [36:42] and they're not as strict in the rules [36:44] and obedience so your obedience doesn't [36:47] have to look as [36:47] flashy and clean as the as schutzen [36:51] yeah however you know it still still has [36:54] its uh [36:55] difficulties especially because you need [36:57] the decoys to help you out [36:58] and decoys uh they could be kind of [37:01] expensive [37:02] so you know if you're attic yeah unless [37:04] unless you're at a [37:05] at a club and you know it's going to be [37:07] kind of it's [37:08] it's going to be pretty expensive to do [37:09] it especially if you're trying to get to [37:11] the top level [37:12] if you're trying to get to the top level [37:13] you need top-level decoys and you're [37:14] trying to yeah you're traveling you're [37:16] going to seminars you're doing all this [37:17] so you're going to spend some money [37:18] and then uh psa psa [37:22] is also becoming a little bit more [37:23] popular i know you haven't [37:25] decoyed in psja i was certified years [37:27] ago but i never [37:28] decoyed a competition or anything like [37:30] that and psa is also another great entry [37:33] i think the obedience in psa they take [37:35] very [37:36] seriously i think the protection [37:39] on psa is easier than french ring [37:42] or even mondo ring but it's a great [37:46] great fun sport i mean i really enjoyed [37:47] it a lot of good people in there as well [37:49] and that's one of the things too when [37:51] you start checking out these different [37:52] sports [37:53] so if i was telling somebody let's say [37:56] you know [37:57] wherever let's say south carolina [38:00] someone in south carolina wanting to [38:01] train their dog i'd say check out all [38:02] the clubs and then [38:04] determine based on the people yeah you [38:06] know what people do you like better what [38:08] training style do you like better [38:10] and what does your dog enjoy most you [38:12] know if your dog really likes biting the [38:14] bite sleeve and loves to track [38:16] shuts it all the way you know if your [38:18] dog really enjoys biting that bite suit [38:20] you know then maybe one of the other [38:21] ones might be a better choice [38:23] i always like to do what the dog really [38:24] enjoys exactly [38:26] and yeah french ring i i do enjoy [38:28] talking about french ring because it is [38:30] so challenging i like that you talked [38:32] about the fact that [38:33] you have to have strong decoys to help [38:36] with it now why is that why is it that [38:39] the [38:39] decoy work is so big when it comes to [38:42] french ring [38:43] and having certain level decoys in order [38:45] to get to the top level is very [38:46] important in comparison to maybe i mean [38:48] in any sport whoever's working your dog [38:51] uh has to you know they got to know what [38:53] they're looking at their timing has to [38:54] be good they got to know when to [38:56] you know correct when to reward when to [38:58] do all that stuff so [38:59] in all sports however when it comes to [39:01] you know frenching [39:02] you know teaching the object guard when [39:05] to you know when to give when to come in [39:07] when to step out when to you know to me [39:09] that requires [39:10] somebody that not only can is athletic [39:14] but has the mind of a trainer and knows [39:16] when to mark knows when to you know when [39:18] to reward and all that so [39:20] and again for all of them but i think [39:22] for french training because of the you [39:23] know the object guard [39:25] the search you know on one of them [39:27] you're teaching the dog to stay on the [39:28] object [39:29] on the other one you're teaching the [39:30] doctor follow the decoy [39:32] and you know and not get meters away [39:33] which is the escort so it's like [39:36] man it's so many different things you [39:37] know the defensive handler he's supposed [39:39] to stay next to you until the [39:40] decoy hits you he can't bite the face [39:43] attack on one of them he recalls on the [39:45] other one he has to stay there [39:47] uh for the gun attack he has to guard [39:49] the guy when the guy tries so there's [39:51] just so many things when it comes to [39:52] protection [39:53] and friendship that to me it's like you [39:56] know it's it's a whole different [39:57] ball game and protection in shutzin is [40:00] literally [40:01] an escape bite a re-attack [40:04] a back transport uh [40:08] another attack and then a long bite you [40:10] know [40:11] it's it's you know it's very minimal [40:14] compared to [40:15] french ring i tried uh with wapo because [40:18] you could go from shutting three [40:19] to a french ring three so i crossed over [40:22] and competed in a french during three [40:23] just to see where we were at [40:24] because i started him in french ring but [40:28] he works at such a you know he gives 120 [40:31] to every for everything that when we [40:34] went to french ring is a 45 minute [40:35] routine he was done [40:37] like there was three exercises left and [40:39] i had to pull him because he couldn't [40:40] breathe anymore he was like yeah he was [40:41] just done and he has a breathing problem [40:44] but he can't really focus uh when he [40:48] can't really focus on breathing [40:50] so he just gassed out that's interesting [40:52] yeah it's a long time 45 minutes [40:54] and then when it's hot oh man that's [40:56] ridiculous and during that 45 minutes [40:58] they're doing the obedience they're [40:59] doing the agility and then they're doing [41:01] the protection as well [41:02] and like you said there's a lot of [41:04] different protection exercises that they [41:06] have to do in the sport [41:07] now with schutzen we have obedience [41:10] agility tracking obedience and [41:14] protection it's all split into three [41:16] so each uh routine is going to come out [41:18] to like you know [41:19] the the obedience routine i believe is [41:21] like eight eight to ten minutes or [41:22] something like that they do [41:23] one at a time yeah one at a time and [41:26] it's also hard because [41:27] literally if you don't pass one you [41:29] don't get your title [41:31] as to where in french ring it's all [41:32] together and you could miss a couple [41:34] exercises [41:35] and you could still pass so you know it [41:38] has its benefits and [41:39] i was thinking agility too because they [41:40] have the a-frame and the jumps [41:42] yeah that's part of obedience yeah so [41:44] retrieves is a big one too so retrieval [41:46] training [41:47] that's could be worthwhile to talk about [41:49] because you can do retrieval training so [41:50] a large portion of my audience [41:52] they are trying to learn how to train [41:53] service dogs as well and so this is [41:55] something that's important to keep in [41:57] mind too [41:57] if you're training a service dog so [41:59] you've trained some service dogs or have [42:00] you uh here and there not not too much [42:02] not too many yeah i mean uh so with [42:05] service dogs though [42:06] a lot of times people think that service [42:07] dog training is very difficult and what [42:09] i tell people it's really not [42:11] it's really not that hard it's more [42:13] about having the right dog of course [42:15] and then having the time and the [42:17] patience because there is no precision [42:19] there is no [42:20] grading it's like can the dog simply do [42:22] the job yeah and one of the jobs that is [42:24] required by a lot of service dogs is [42:25] retrieval training so somebody's in a [42:27] wheelchair [42:28] they drop something the dog has to be [42:30] able to pick it up and hand it to them [42:32] now doing the shits and level [42:35] retrieval training i think is very [42:37] transferable over to service dog [42:39] training would you agree [42:40] um yes and yes [42:44] and yes and no all right so i mean like [42:46] you said [42:47] when it comes to service dogs they don't [42:49] ask for like a certain criteria you just [42:50] got to pick the thing up right and hand [42:52] it to them [42:53] in ipo in shut-in the dog has to go out [42:56] fast [42:57] come back fast be very straight right in [43:00] the center [43:00] he can't chew the dumbbell and he's [43:03] supposed to out it as soon as you tell [43:05] him [43:05] so there's a lot of uh you know links to [43:08] this chain [43:09] that you put together as to where in [43:12] the service dog you know he just needs [43:15] to pick it up however [43:16] here the dog is in drive he's in [43:18] competition [43:19] as to where a service dog he's maybe out [43:22] of you know [43:22] out of drive he's just hanging out and [43:24] you drop something and he has to pick it [43:26] up [43:26] to me that's super impressive if you [43:29] could get a dog to pick something up for [43:30] you [43:31] every single time uh by pointing at it [43:34] or whatever [43:35] so maybe you could educate me on this a [43:36] little bit well i learned retrieval [43:39] training when i went to the tom rose [43:41] school [43:41] and tom rose founded his school [43:44] basically [43:44] on not on but i mean he his intentions [43:47] was to be able to train [43:48] students to go out compete and win yeah [43:50] and he was a competitor in shits in back [43:52] in the 70s and 80s [43:54] and i think even now he wants to compete [43:55] again i'm not 100 sure so don't quote me [43:58] on that [43:58] but i learned his retrieval training [44:00] process [44:01] for schutzen and then i was able to just [44:04] take that and transfer it over [44:05] to service dog training because the way [44:07] i looked at it if you could teach a dog [44:08] to do a competitive retrieve [44:10] where they have to run out like you said [44:12] but now but it's different times [44:14] you know you're talking he's he's [44:16] training dogs for retrieval back then [44:19] to now it's it's just it's different [44:21] times now they want [44:22] you know more speed you know way more [44:25] you know there's just the level that [44:27] they want this the precision that they [44:29] want this retrieve to look like this is [44:30] ridiculous [44:31] i always lose points on it so that's [44:33] what i'm saying [44:34] is is different yeah you know it could [44:36] be the same you could teach the retrieve [44:38] the same way but for what if you and it [44:41] depends on the [44:42] level if you just want to get a title [44:44] yeah i'm sure you could teach them the [44:45] same exact way [44:46] but if you want to compete and be at the [44:49] high level you got to go a different [44:50] route [44:51] how do you get them to go fast what is [44:53] your training process well usually the [44:55] problem's not [44:57] going out is you know because you throw [44:58] it so they're you know [45:00] they're they want to go out and grab [45:02] that thing uh to [45:03] bring it back uh right now like what [45:06] people are doing right now like [45:07] marco so i know marco and sarah and i [45:10] think uh [45:11] you know i read this book called uh [45:14] what's this book [45:15] it's the green schatzen book by peter [45:18] sherk i believe it is [45:19] anyways he teaches to [45:22] he teaches dogs to um to grab two toys [45:27] at the same time right so he'll go like [45:30] he'll have two little two balls and i [45:32] mean two little squishy toys and he'll [45:34] say [45:34] grab this one and then grab this one and [45:35] come and play with me grab this one grab [45:37] this one and come play with me [45:39] and then later on he'll like separate [45:41] them and the dog will go grab this one [45:43] and then this one and come play [45:44] eventually you put one in the front one [45:47] you know one right behind it he goes out [45:50] he grabs it grabs this one comes back [45:51] now you could throw one and the dog is [45:55] not only gonna go out fast but he's [45:57] gonna come back fast because there's not [45:58] only something out there for him but [46:00] there's something over here for him [46:01] at the same time so he teaches the dog [46:03] to go out and come back fast [46:06] that right there is required in in [46:08] shut-in [46:09] and then you could break the other side [46:11] the holding and do all that you could do [46:12] it separate [46:13] but there's literally a mark to let the [46:15] dog know that [46:16] he's not gonna drop the dumbbell he's [46:18] gonna take another toy with the dumbbell [46:20] in his mouth [46:21] so they teach the dog to go out come [46:23] back fast that's how you create speed [46:24] that's interesting that's what this is [46:26] like what i love about dog training what [46:28] i try to teach [46:29] people that i work with is the most [46:31] important thing is understanding the [46:33] signs [46:33] if you can understand the science then [46:35] you can come up with different [46:36] techniques [46:37] that could work so like that is [46:38] fascinating to me because now the dog is [46:40] excited to run out and then the dog is [46:42] excited to come back in the other [46:43] direction [46:44] and i might be butchering a little bit [46:45] but like the concept that's what it is i [46:47] just started with my puppy [46:48] yeah but that's kind of what it is it's [46:51] there's something out there for you and [46:52] there's something over here for you and [46:54] you [46:54] have learned to get these two things [46:57] into your mouth and be possessive [46:59] yeah yeah and uh crap i had something [47:01] else i was about to say [47:03] based on that but it's what it's [47:06] it's the concept that i try to do with [47:08] everything so for example um [47:10] now i haven't competed in akc obedience [47:13] it's one of the requirements when you go [47:14] through the tom rose school where i was [47:16] you know a student and eventually an [47:18] instructor at [47:18] and we have to do all the akc obedience [47:21] routines in order to graduate and they [47:22] get tested there at the school [47:24] so they have to do the the novice [47:27] open and then if you're doing the master [47:29] class or the master program then you [47:31] have to do the utility routine [47:32] which the utility routine is insanely [47:35] difficult it's very challenging [47:36] and one of the requirements is a send [47:39] out to directed jumps [47:40] so you send the dog the dog has to run [47:42] to the end of the training building [47:44] you say sit they have to sit and then [47:46] the evaluator tells you which [47:48] jump for the dog to do and there's two [47:49] jumps and one on each side so you have [47:51] to go jump and the dog jumps it they do [47:52] a sit front and then they flip in the [47:54] heel position [47:55] when i train that routine i never [47:58] would send the dog and then to have the [48:01] dog do the jump [48:02] one right after another because then the [48:03] dog starts anticipating the jump [48:05] and then it slows them down so then they [48:07] don't want to come so another one of my [48:08] buddies for example he's learning how to [48:10] train dogs so i'm [48:11] evaluating or critiquing his training [48:14] videos and so he sent me one on recall [48:16] that he's doing and as the dog is coming [48:18] in the dogs now [48:19] he's not competing so the dog being [48:21] crooked and things like that really [48:22] doesn't matter that much [48:23] but the dog is very far away and then [48:26] he's taking he's using his terminal mark [48:28] and he's throwing the ball [48:29] over the dog's head now what do you [48:31] think that might end up doing for the [48:32] dog's recall [48:33] slowing them down slowing it down [48:35] exactly and why would it slow down [48:36] because you're going against what you're [48:39] you're you're adding you're adding an [48:41] incompatible behavior [48:42] or you know reward placement to what you [48:45] really want you want to come [48:47] fast but you're giving him a reward [48:48] behind he's going to go yo why am i [48:50] going fast to you when i know you're [48:51] going to toss the reward behind me [48:53] exactly and that's exactly what i said [48:54] but now i might do something like that [48:56] if i'm teaching the dog a down on recall [48:59] because then i want the dog to down very [49:01] quickly and think about the reward [49:02] coming [49:03] the opposite direction so then he downs [49:05] but then that could also slow down the [49:06] recall too because now the dog's going [49:08] oh you're gonna tell me to down [49:10] so that's the beauty i think about [49:11] competition is being able to take [49:13] something that you want the dog to do [49:14] and not only have [49:16] them do it but have them do it at a [49:18] level that's beyond everybody else yeah [49:19] yeah i we i just did a a a little live [49:23] instagram thing with my buddy forest [49:25] forest mickey oh yeah [49:27] and he talked about the send away man [49:29] and he broke it down in a way that [49:31] you're like [49:32] whoa that makes sense so anybody [49:35] watching [49:35] make sure you guys check that out for us [49:37] mickey rocks i mean yeah i love his work [49:39] i'm gonna put that on my on my youtube [49:41] actually because it's just on instagram [49:42] right now but i'm gonna put it on my [49:43] youtube man but it was like [49:45] everybody that was watching sending me a [49:47] message just like yo that was awesome [49:48] like the way he broke it down [49:49] he's just such a good teacher that [49:51] you're like it makes sense [49:53] yeah i agree i think he's an exceptional [49:54] teacher michael ellis i know we were [49:56] talking about him earlier as well [49:58] uh who are some of the dog trainers that [49:59] you've looked up to in your career [50:01] um i mean i mean there's there's so many [50:03] of them uh and for different [50:05] for different things but for sure i mean [50:08] michael ellis [50:09] is you know bart bart bellen [50:12] um even though i've never trained with [50:14] him personally but just like the content [50:16] and like the things that i've gotten [50:17] from people that have gone to see him [50:20] um who else when it comes to like uh [50:23] ivan of course yeah i've been you know [50:26] ivan's one of the top trainers [50:28] um there's uh mike [50:31] so when it came to ipo mike lorraine i [50:33] learned some of my you know my bark and [50:35] hole stuff [50:36] uh joseph when it came to like some [50:39] french drink stuff [50:40] he taught me a lot of stuff forest is [50:42] one of my mentors like that's who i [50:45] really you know i could you know rely on [50:47] when i need some [50:49] some help uh so i learned a ton from him [50:52] still learning from him [50:53] so can you talk a little bit about what [50:55] he explained [50:56] yeah so so what's the send out first for [50:58] the audience they know well the send out [51:00] is uh basically [51:01] you there's a send out in in every sport [51:04] that i that i that i've been in uh [51:07] french ring mondo ring [51:09] and ipo and they're different for for [51:11] for ring sports uh you basically [51:13] you're at it at your start line you send [51:15] your dog once he goes past a certain [51:18] point you recall your dog he comes back [51:19] to you so he's just supposed to run [51:21] straight [51:22] uh in ipo he's supposed to run straight [51:24] when he gets to the end of the field the [51:26] judge will tell you to down your dog [51:27] you're supposed to down him and he's [51:28] supposed to down [51:29] uh so that's kind of what it is uh the [51:32] the rook [51:32] you know the rundown of the way he kind [51:34] of explained it was [51:36] they basically they always have a toy [51:38] out there and they teach the dog there's [51:40] going to be something there for you [51:42] forever in a separate [51:46] session you're going to be teaching also [51:48] the doctor down [51:49] to down to down to down and you're going [51:51] to pay him it could be through a game or [51:53] whatever [51:54] anyways at some point you're going to [51:56] shorten up a little bit [51:57] instead of sending him from a long [51:58] distance you can shorten up you're going [51:59] to send them [52:00] the dog's not going to find anything and [52:02] you're going to tell them to down [52:04] and he's going to you know he's you've [52:06] never done this before so he's going to [52:07] be like what so you might have to give [52:08] him a couple more cues down [52:10] down eventually he'll do it yes boom if [52:13] you pay him [52:14] with you so he's like oh shoot that was [52:17] you know pretty awesome [52:18] then you go back you send them put a toy [52:19] out there and again you [52:21] try it you send them no toy you tell [52:23] them to down [52:24] it might take a couple times eventually [52:26] he's gonna figure out [52:27] you know there's nothing here i'm gonna [52:30] down [52:30] boom so then you give that now the dog's [52:33] gonna understand [52:34] when he when he tells me to down is [52:36] because there's not nothing's gonna be [52:38] over here for me [52:39] that's i've already learned that through [52:41] experience to trial and error i'm not [52:42] gonna find anything here [52:44] and the only other option is to down so [52:46] he can reward me down there [52:48] or you can come back and give him room [52:50] service and pay him in a down position [52:52] um but but the way again i don't know [52:55] how to explain things the way [52:56] forrest knows how to explain things so [52:58] but that was kind of like the rundown of [53:00] kind of how it went through [53:01] and eventually you have a dog that goes [53:03] out super fast and when you tell him to [53:05] down [53:05] he turns around and faces you on a down [53:07] position because he knows [53:09] that there's nothing out there [53:11] everything is with you [53:13] that's interesting yeah i like that yeah [53:14] i've always every time i've done the [53:16] send out [53:17] very similar to that i start really [53:19] close to where i want the dog to run [53:21] i first start with food and then i will [53:23] continue to [53:24] increase distance and keep sending the [53:26] dog to the food up into the point where [53:28] they know that there's food out there [53:30] and then i switch it to a toy and then [53:31] just like you said every time i send [53:33] them there's [53:34] always a reward almost every single time [53:37] unless it's [53:38] time to stay down but i like how you [53:40] explain to where [53:41] the down means there's no toy out there [53:43] the toy is back this way [53:45] but you probably you do way more where [53:47] the toys out there [53:48] yeah of course in the beginning you got [53:50] to make sure you create passion [53:51] and you know for running for going [53:53] forward and that's the first thing that [53:55] you want to do some people [53:56] would like to teach with a touch pad and [53:57] some dogs love to run to a touch pad [54:00] however you know if you create you know [54:02] direct like the [54:03] reward is going to be right there make [54:05] sure you go go go [54:06] go go uh you know you definitely get [54:09] more speed out of your [54:10] send away yeah so we're going to be [54:12] doing a protection series which i'm [54:13] really excited about are there some [54:15] things that you might be able to tell [54:16] the audience little teasers of what [54:18] we're going to be doing um [54:19] mainly you know how to create some more [54:20] motivation in the dog when it comes to [54:22] you know biting [54:23] biting the toys and all that uh maybe [54:26] teaching them some impulse control [54:27] how to stop you know riding you know [54:30] mid-air when the dog is trying to bite [54:31] you tell him done he's supposed to stop [54:33] and then he's gonna bite [54:34] how to bark at the toy how to bark when [54:37] to bark when [54:38] not to bark uh all these are little [54:40] things that we i think we're gonna cover [54:42] and uh should be good yeah i'm super [54:43] excited about it so [54:45] we'll put a link in the description so [54:46] people will

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 30/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everybody welcome back to another [00:01] episode today we're going to be working [00:03] with the shaping box now a shaping box [00:06] is a tool that we can use to help fix [00:08] our heel position [00:09] our sit front position and it also helps [00:11] with our stationary exercises such as [00:13] sit down and stand [00:15] and i'm going to show you how i like to [00:16] use a shaping box when working with my [00:17] dog [00:18] so you can see we have ari over here [00:20] she's hanging out [00:22] she did that all on her own now when i'm [00:24] first teaching a shaping box i don't [00:26] just take the dog place them in the box [00:28] and expect them to know what to do [00:30] i re-teach it the same way i would teach [00:32] anything else i first start with the [00:34] physical cue [00:35] and i use continual reinforcement [00:37] meaning i reward [00:38] every single time my dog does it [00:40] correctly if you want to learn how to [00:42] space out rewards i have a video [00:44] on how to do that to get your dog to the [00:45] point where they can do everything [00:47] without needing a constant reward very [00:49] nice ari [00:50] all right so what i'm going to do i'm [00:52] going to give her a reward out here and [00:53] i like to just simply take her [00:55] bring her into heel position and guide [00:57] her into the shaping box [01:00] i like to bring my dog all the way to [01:01] the very end where the front board is [01:04] break break is a release word it's not a [01:07] marker it's just simply releasing her [01:09] so again i bring her around and i'm [01:11] going to walk her into the position [01:14] and then i'm going to give her the [01:15] reward once she's in the correct spot [01:17] you can use a marker if you want but [01:18] remember when our dog does a behavior [01:20] we're trying to capture [01:21] we have one second to either give the [01:23] dog the primary reinforcer food toy or [01:26] affection [01:27] or we have one second to say the [01:29] condition reinforcer [01:30] yes and then follow it up with the [01:33] primary reinforcer [01:35] break so again break is my release word [01:37] releasing her from the position [01:39] and what i like to do when i'm using a [01:40] shaping box i like to teach my dog [01:43] how to get inside the shaping box from [01:45] every single different position [01:47] we start with the easiest first where we [01:49] simply walk our dog [01:51] into the front they feel the front [01:54] that's where they stop [01:56] break we can also have them come from [01:59] the front side of the shaping box so we [02:01] have them walk [02:02] forward and around into the correct [02:05] position [02:06] then they get the reward brick [02:10] i like to do it from every single [02:11] direction every angle so we start here [02:13] and again i'm not using a command all i [02:16] want her to do is know how to get into [02:18] the position [02:19] if her legs out of the position we can [02:21] adjust [02:22] ari is very very food motivated and we [02:25] don't want her paws [02:26] sitting on top of the board like she's [02:28] doing right there so when she does that [02:30] i don't reward her i wait till she's in [02:32] the correct position [02:33] that's when i reward her break once we [02:36] have our dog understanding [02:38] how to get into the shaping box then we [02:42] we want to start having them do all [02:44] their basic commands [02:46] sit down and stand so again all i'm [02:48] going to do is i'm going to lure her [02:50] into the positions so she knows how to [02:53] get into each position [02:55] when she's in the shaping box so all the [02:58] different cues that we used before [03:00] so sit we're lifting up for the down [03:03] we're bringing our hands straight down [03:04] for the stand we're tucking underneath [03:06] towards our chest and we want to get our [03:08] dog to be able to do those positions [03:10] while they're inside that shaping box [03:12] what this does is it helps prevent our [03:14] dog from [03:15] shifting their hips to the side if you [03:17] have a lazy down [03:19] we want that sphinx look where they're [03:20] straight their whole body is straight [03:22] just like she is right there and again [03:25] having the shaping box prevents them [03:27] from making those mistakes and since i'm [03:29] not using a command right now [03:31] it's okay for her to get into the [03:33] position get the reward and jump back up [03:35] no problem so what i'll do is break [03:40] i'll take the shaping box and then i'll [03:44] have my dog go directly in front of me [03:45] now [03:46] and i'm going to do all the positions [03:49] the same way i would [03:51] when i'm teaching them any other [03:54] time in the dog's training so we go [03:56] through those positions then if you want [03:58] you can name the commands [03:59] while your dog's in the shaping box so [04:01] you can say down then you would do the [04:02] cue she should have done it but she did [04:04] not [04:05] if they get up no cue them back into the [04:08] position good note down [04:09] good note down good just get a little [04:12] slap note [04:13] down good girl break [04:16] they're not always perfect she's not [04:18] always perfect but we go through the [04:20] positions while they're inside the [04:21] shaping box [04:22] now i'm going to use this break i'm [04:25] going to use this [04:26] to help reinforce or to help my dog [04:29] get into a straight sit front as well as [04:33] using this for our heel position [04:35] brick i'm going to move this back a [04:38] little bit for the camera [04:41] then i'm going to take ari and i'm going [04:43] to bring her over to you [04:45] come here down place her into a command [04:48] and position [04:49] you could also use the climb command if [04:51] you're still just starting on your stays [04:53] the climb is the easier stay to work [04:56] and in the beginning i'm gonna help her [04:58] with the physical cue because this is a [05:00] new picture for our dog and we don't [05:01] want them to just break like she did [05:03] i could have corrected her but that's [05:05] okay we're gonna bring her back she's [05:07] very motivated [05:08] down and since she broke the position [05:12] i'm going to walk over here [05:14] and then i'm going to say yes and i'm [05:16] going to go back and reward her [05:17] for maintaining the position [05:21] i'm going to do one more of those [05:25] yes so our dog doesn't always anticipate [05:28] coming to us when they're in a stay so [05:31] this helps reinforce that stay [05:33] then i'm gonna come back into the [05:34] position i'm gonna help her out [05:36] come and then i can guide her once she [05:39] gets in that perfect sift front position [05:41] with the shaping box yes [05:44] i can use my continuation marker to mark [05:47] and reward [05:48] and i want her to maintain that eye [05:49] contact yes [05:51] and once i say yes it's okay for her to [05:53] turn away [05:54] to look to see where the treats coming [05:56] and then immediately go back into [05:57] looking at my face [06:00] yes i also like to switch hands if i'm [06:03] doing this [06:04] yes so they don't get focused just on [06:06] one hand [06:10] yes excellent break another really i [06:14] dropped it all right [06:15] come here baby another nice thing about [06:17] these climb or these [06:18] shaping boxes get out the shaving box [06:21] young lady [06:22] all right is we can flip it over [06:26] and use it almost as a climb platform [06:28] and same thing with this even though [06:30] it's a climb [06:31] it's a little different than some of the [06:32] bigger ones we may use [06:34] so we want to teach them that as well [06:36] and i'll use this to help reinforce the [06:38] heel position [06:40] so i can have her in one position tell [06:43] her heel [06:44] and then she has to work around and get [06:46] into that perfect heel position and then [06:48] we can mark and reward break [06:50] we could also do the same thing [06:55] if we have it turned around and we want [06:57] to do the buy [06:58] finish so i never really taught her the [07:00] buy finish [07:02] i just taught her the flip finish but [07:03] what we do is we guide them around our [07:05] body [07:07] into the perfect heel position make sure [07:08] the paws are not sitting on the front of [07:10] the wood [07:11] so she's not getting any treats right [07:12] now not until she's in the right spot so [07:14] i'm waiting for that pause back down [07:16] there we go yes then we reward [07:19] yes reward break [07:23] this is something that can help our dog [07:24] also find the [07:26] sid front position from any other [07:28] position all right break [07:30] down [07:35] so i could be standing right here and i [07:36] can call her into the sit front [07:42] come [07:44] okay yes not perfect but pretty good [07:47] yes break good girl baby come on [07:51] i read this way come here sweetie [07:54] down we're gonna try another one [07:58] and if you had to you could assist by [08:00] guiding her dog by using luring to get [08:02] her in the right position [08:03] come and she did it early that's okay [08:07] free use my terminal marker release and [08:10] reward [08:11] so that's the basics when it comes to [08:12] using a shaping box [08:14] we can use it to help with the heel [08:15] position the sit front position [08:17] finding the correct position and then [08:19] also using it for shaping [08:21] that perfect sit down and stand command [08:24] i hope you guys enjoyed today's video [08:26] thank you so much for watching and as [08:27] always please like subscribe [08:29] hit that notification bell and i'll see

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 34/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode today we are going to be [00:03] teaching our dogs how to bark on command [00:05] i'm here with my great friend sergio [00:07] escobel some of you guys may have seen [00:09] him already he has an excellent channel [00:11] i highly recommend going to it and [00:13] subscribing so you can follow his [00:15] journey with harley and a lot of you [00:17] already know who harley is as the star [00:20] of our service dog series all right so [00:22] the way that this is going to work today [00:23] just like everything else what we first [00:25] want to do is we want to teach the [00:26] behavior we teach the behavior before we [00:29] put it on a physical cue we're going to [00:31] use the concept of frustration [00:33] i'm going to hold hardly i'm going to [00:34] sit down and i'm going to hold her i'm [00:35] going to be acting as a back tie with [00:37] the leash attached to a harness and then [00:40] what sergio is going to do is he's going [00:42] to tease her with the toy until she [00:44] walks the moment she barks yes [00:47] go over and reward her and play with her [00:49] we want her to know it's the act of [00:51] barking that is bringing the toy to her [00:54] now once she's doing that then we're [00:56] going to add the command just like [00:57] everything else the command comes what [01:01] before the physical queue sorry i was [01:03] thinking [01:05] i was thinking about [01:06] like the drill that we're going to be [01:08] doing with her i'm like okay he's right [01:10] now it's before the physical cue so he's [01:13] going to have the ball or the toy behind [01:14] his back and his command for her to bark [01:17] is going to be [01:18] a response it's going to be respond he [01:20] was a drill instructor so he's going to [01:22] say respond and then he's going to pull [01:24] the toy out so it becomes a predictable [01:27] pattern so then harley hears her spawn [01:29] she thinks toy she barks boom we got it [01:32] on a verbal command [01:34] now since we're just starting this with [01:35] her she's not going to be able to do it [01:36] on the verbal command alone but you guys [01:38] will be able to see the process in this [01:40] video any questions before we start yeah [01:42] so i just really want to make sure that [01:44] you know i say the um the markers [01:46] correct all right so [01:48] with the bark and then when the marker [01:50] said you know how's that timing [01:53] okay so the moment she marks is when [01:54] you're going to say the marker we're [01:56] doing it at the beginning and we're just [01:57] using the physical cue there's really no [01:59] command so you can use yes or free the [02:01] terminal marker or the continuation [02:04] and this is also a command that has a [02:06] completion unlike something like a stake [02:08] so if you tell your dog to down and [02:10] she's in a down stake and you use a [02:11] continuation marker she has to maintain [02:13] it because it's an exercise that is easy [02:15] to continue but something like a bark [02:17] once they bark they completed the [02:19] behavior unless you want them to [02:20] continue barking so in that situation [02:22] you can also use yes and free since it's [02:25] a start and complete exercise does that [02:27] make sense it does okay cool all right [02:29] so we're going to jump right in go ahead [02:30] and get some water there you and then [02:32] get your toy [02:34] all right all right and i'm going to [02:36] bring harley over here [02:38] and he's going to start teasing [02:40] oh harley [02:41] come on ready [02:43] now build more distance when you need to [02:45] come here [02:55] [Music] [03:02] now you see he brings the toy over and [03:04] rewards her for barking so the reward is [03:06] the toy [03:07] he's going to do a little play a little [03:09] bit of pulling a little bit of tug [03:11] back and forth petting her praising her [03:13] letting her know that's what she [03:15] [Music] [03:16] if she releases it then he's going to [03:19] tease her even more [03:22] if he can steal it from her he's going [03:23] to make [03:24] oh she got me good race capricorn [03:39] um [03:42] [Music] [03:46] you have to make sure you respond the [03:48] moment your dog barks your dog must know [03:51] it's the barking that is initiating the [03:54] reward and bringing the reward to her [03:56] which starts this entire fun game good [03:58] girl now what we can do if we want to [04:01] build more frustration it's a little bit [04:02] harder with an older dog [04:04] but we can make them drop it by picking [04:06] them up so you're going to grab the toy [04:07] again and you can be playing tough but [04:09] no tension just kind of moving a little [04:11] bit now what i'm going to do is i'm [04:12] going to pick her up slightly from the [04:14] back [04:14] good [04:15] frustrating [04:16] oh you want this huh [04:21] good girl harley [04:22] all right [04:24] by lifting up the back end most dogs [04:26] will release the item in fact this is [04:29] one of the techniques that people use to [04:30] stop dog fights because lifting up the [04:32] back end [04:33] takes their mind from what's going on in [04:35] the front to the back side so i like to [04:37] do this when i'm trying to build a dog's [04:39] frustration in something that we're [04:41] using in order to teach us so now put it [04:44] on your back [04:45] so now we're going to add the command so [04:46] he's going to say the command then he's [04:48] going to bring the toy out and wait for [04:49] her to go [04:51] respawn [04:58] lots of freeze [05:04] very nice and sometimes what i'll do is [05:06] i'll really show the dog that it's the [05:07] barking that's triggering it so i'll [05:09] give you a couple other examples if you [05:11] don't mind i'll do a couple of them yeah [05:12] absolutely [05:13] we're getting tired anyways guys [05:15] so we're gonna do a switch good girl [05:18] very nice [05:20] so i'll tease [05:30] so really showing her every bark is boom [05:32] i'm getting closer i'm getting closer [05:34] very good nice smooth motion moving back [05:37] and forth pet tap on the side i might [05:38] even act like oh but it's a pen [05:42] very good and then do what i did pick up [05:45] her back end until she releases [05:47] but just scoop underneath [05:50] good good good [05:51] all right so now behind my back and then [05:53] i go [05:54] respond [05:58] and i didn't whoa [06:00] you lost this you lost it [06:05] and i'm not even marking it [06:07] so just being moving has actually been [06:09] enough but you can definitely mark good [06:11] girl [06:12] that's a good session [06:14] so as you can see [06:16] it's very tiring for us [06:18] humans

shepherd breed [00:33] malinois australian kettle dog and the [00:36] belgian turviren [00:38] bethany's passion for hiking and dogs [00:40] combined it in 2013 [00:42] when she and her belgian

total of 3 000 miles [00:57] so without further ado please welcome [00:59] the one and only bethany perdom [01:01] hey thanks again for having me out i [01:03] really appreciate it [01:04] so let's go ahead and jump right in we [01:06] filmed a protection series last week [01:07] this has been on really high demand [01:09] a lot of people have been asking me [01:10] about it and you're one of the first [01:12] individuals i thought about you and [01:13] jean-luc because i love the way you guys [01:15] train [01:15] it's very comparable to the way that i [01:17] train and also a lot of my followers [01:19] so last week we filmed a small [01:21] introduction series on [01:22] french ring and i want to talk about it [01:24] a little bit and kind of get everyone [01:26] excited for it [01:27] yeah french ring is not a simple sport [01:30] so trying to just do an intro is really [01:32] difficult to do but i think we did a [01:34] good job at least [01:35] getting things started definitely and in [01:38] the beginning we start with the puppies [01:39] that's one of the biggest thing is [01:41] taking a puppy [01:42] and imprinting them for the sport or [01:45] whatever it is you want to do so if [01:46] somebody [01:47] most people who are competing in any [01:49] sport i would imagine [01:50] protection sport or even akc agility [01:53] they like to start when they're a puppy [01:55] yeah and why is that so important [01:57] it's just like so it's getting the dog [02:00] to like the game [02:01] so just like with little kids you start [02:02] them in t-ball that doesn't mean that [02:03] they're gonna go play major league [02:05] but most major league players started [02:07] playing t-ball [02:08] so it is possible for um like in people [02:12] to start a sport you know around 12 [02:14] years old but you're not going to start [02:15] at age 25 and expect to go to the major [02:18] leagues just because you don't have the [02:19] experience [02:20] and the same thing with puppies you can [02:22] start a dog that's green and [02:24] green means just doesn't have any prior [02:26] training [02:27] but usually they're an older dog like [02:29] six months up [02:30] would be considered a green dog and it [02:33] is possible to start with those [02:35] those kinds of dogs but it's always [02:36] better if you can lay a nice solid [02:38] foundation and teach them from the [02:40] get-go [02:40] it's funny when i first heard someone [02:42] say green dog when i was fresh into dog [02:44] training i had no idea what it was i'm [02:46] like what do you mean what is a green [02:47] dog [02:48] and the funny part was it was when i was [02:49] at the tom rose school i completed the [02:51] professional program [02:52] and i went back and i was filming some [02:54] training videos with tom rose [02:56] and i had the dog that i put through the [02:58] course one of the dogs which was a [03:00] long-haired dutch shepherd and [03:02] this dog was such a goof i mean he's a [03:03] search and rescue dog right now yeah [03:05] but it's kind of funny because when we [03:06] were filming tom rose goes whose green [03:09] dog is this [03:10] i'm like dog after training that's not [03:13] very nice [03:15] well that dog was such a knucklehead i [03:17] love him to death he's a great dog and [03:18] like i said he's doing search and rescue [03:20] now [03:20] but it was the first dog that i ever [03:22] trained so i made so [03:23] many mistakes and every mistake you [03:26] could think about i pretty much made and [03:27] when i was going to the school [03:29] my biggest critique that i had and we [03:31] could touch a little bit on this too [03:32] because it is very important when it [03:34] comes to training a dog and why it was [03:35] such a big mistake for me [03:37] because i was trying to learn a skill [03:38] set i wanted to be very good at training [03:40] dogs [03:41] and i know that takes more than just [03:43] reading about it and studying about it [03:45] you need actual [03:46] application to really get that [03:47] comprehension level [03:49] so i would train from 9am when class [03:51] started uh on a night out and then [03:53] i would train until 10 o'clock at night [03:55] 10 pm and i train the dogs constantly so [03:58] i [03:58] over train the dogs i stressed them out [04:00] i made them not [04:02] enjoy the training and that was my [04:04] biggest critique they're like you're [04:05] overworking [04:06] your dogs what are some of the issues [04:08] that people can have besides some of the [04:10] ones that i had [04:11] if they are over training they're not [04:12] reading the dog correctly [04:14] that's that we just said not reading the [04:16] dog correctly so you have to see [04:18] you always with puppies especially when [04:19] you're first starting out you want to [04:20] leave them wanting more [04:22] that's um so if you if you train until [04:25] they're like okay i'm done i don't want [04:27] to play with you anymore i don't want to [04:28] eat anymore i'm tired they start [04:30] shade seeking if it's hot you're losing [04:34] motivation versus leaving the dog on a [04:36] high note [04:37] leave them wanting more when they're at [04:38] their peak that's when you end it and [04:40] that's the hardest thing almost every [04:42] single dog trainer [04:43] me including us you know one more one [04:45] more just one more [04:46] um and the problem with that is if you [04:48] keep asking for more and the dog doesn't [04:49] have anything else to give [04:51] you might be working on one part of the [04:52] equation but you're ruining everything [04:54] else because the motivation's not there [04:56] the biggest thing with dog training is [04:58] you have to have motivation [04:59] either to avoid something or to get [05:01] something it doesn't matter which kind [05:03] but you have to have that motivation [05:04] that motivation is energy [05:06] if you have a dog that's super tired [05:08] that is [05:09] full that is bored they're not going to [05:12] give you 100 because they don't have [05:13] that to give [05:14] so it's reading the dog and noticing [05:17] okay the dog isn't giving 110 [05:19] let's stop now don't push it until the [05:21] dog is totally flat and done [05:23] yeah and then knowing when that level or [05:25] that barrier was for the dog to know to [05:27] stop a little earlier next time [05:29] so you can stop them when they are at [05:31] that really heightened state [05:32] and then talking about motivation this [05:34] is also something [05:36] me and oscar moore talked about it a [05:38] little bit on our podcast episode but [05:40] sometimes you'll see maybe a photo where [05:42] it shows a dog doing protection training [05:45] and then somebody's saying oh how cruel [05:47] of this to teach a dog to do something [05:49] like this [05:50] well when we're training dogs to do any [05:52] sort of protection [05:53] protection sport or even real protection [05:55] you've worked with a lot of police [05:56] departments as well correct [05:57] these dogs love it i mean it's what they [06:00] are bred to do and that's another thing [06:01] that's so great about french ring is [06:03] that it's a breed standard test for the [06:04] melanoma right yeah [06:06] yeah originally it was in france the the [06:08] problem [06:09] if you have a dog that's been bred to do [06:11] the work it's not [06:12] it's the dogs love it it's definitely [06:15] not cruel [06:16] or anything like that if you have a dog [06:18] that doesn't have the right temperament [06:20] for it they don't want to work [06:21] they don't have the character or [06:25] the confidence to do it then yeah you [06:27] can [06:28] be dragging the dog out of the car onto [06:29] the field because they don't really want [06:31] to be there and in that situation it's [06:32] better to find something that dog does [06:34] like to do doc diving agility [06:36] obedience couch potato and get a dog [06:39] that does want to do the work just [06:41] because the dog isn't good at french [06:43] drink doesn't mean that there aren't [06:44] other dog sports a dog can't excel at [06:46] and if you want a dog 4 french ring get [06:48] a dog that's for [06:49] french ring and that means that the dog [06:51] that you [06:52] picked up off of craigslist or got from [06:55] a rescue at three years old it might be [06:57] a malinois but that doesn't mean that it [06:58] has [06:59] the right genetics and the drives to do [07:01] well in the sport and if you really want [07:02] to do [07:03] the sport that dog might be perfect to [07:05] learn on um [07:06] you know and kind of get yourself [07:08] accustomed to the sport find a club [07:11] but then if you really want to compete [07:12] you might need to get an appropriate dog [07:14] for that [07:15] i think it's good to have a dog to learn [07:17] from initially as well because you're [07:18] going to make a lot of mistakes just [07:20] like i mentioned [07:20] yeah you know less than a few minutes [07:22] ago so a dog that's really motivated to [07:25] do it that's going to make the training [07:26] significantly easier [07:28] going back to when i was a student and i [07:29] was first learning about dog training [07:32] um i thought any dog could be trained to [07:34] do anything i was like a dog's a dog you [07:36] could teach any dog to do it which is [07:38] really not the case and [07:40] i like that you said couch potato too [07:42] because some dogs that's all they want [07:43] to do i mean i have people [07:45] message me all the time they're wanting [07:46] to do certain things with their dogs or [07:48] maybe their dog won't bark or they don't [07:50] get excited for the toy and [07:52] not every dog is built the same some may [07:54] enjoy toys [07:55] some may not some may prefer food some [07:57] may not care about either [07:59] especially if they're feeding them out [08:01] of a bowl now that's something i talk [08:02] about quite often [08:04] where i have somebody and they say their [08:06] dog's not food motivated [08:08] how many food or dogs have you run into [08:11] that are not food motivated at all [08:13] so it's usually the people who are also [08:14] free feeding [08:16] you know and then feeding them wet food [08:18] with their dry food or the dog is eating [08:20] a raw diet and just getting [08:23] more than their fair share and they have [08:25] like the highest value food possible and [08:27] they're getting it for free [08:29] so why would they work for a piece of [08:31] hot dog when they're getting [08:32] you know if the hot dogs are level seven [08:34] in terms of [08:35] hierarchy and rewards why would they [08:37] work for a seven when they're getting 10 [08:38] for free [08:40] there's just no reason to unless you [08:41] have a total chow hound that'll work for [08:42] anything [08:43] and then again that goes back to just [08:45] does the dog have the correct drives or [08:47] not [08:47] um but you can definitely if the dog [08:49] from puppyhood [08:50] is used to just having everything always [08:53] be available to [08:54] food toys then again why would you work [08:57] for it [08:57] there's no reason to so the the more um [09:02] the more the rougher their start is and [09:05] again rough is is um [09:08] when i say rough i'm talking to you know [09:10] working for your food [09:11] working for your toys just earning your [09:14] living [09:15] for a dog that's going to get build a [09:17] more motivated [09:18] dog if everything is free they've got 20 [09:20] toys laying out you know tug toys that [09:22] they can play with whenever they want [09:24] they have food whenever they want again [09:25] they don't have that motivation to work [09:27] for it unless you really have the dog [09:28] that will still work through that [09:30] um but you're essentially you're [09:31] spoiling them and then you're asking [09:32] them to go work [09:33] you know 40 hour week why would they do [09:36] that if they're a trust fund kid they [09:37] don't have that motivation [09:39] they might go volunteer if they really [09:40] like their job but they're not going to [09:41] put in the work as if they need that [09:43] money or if they need that food or the [09:45] toys [09:45] right it's like having a spoiled child [09:47] you can spoil a dog [09:49] just like you can spoil a child and once [09:50] you spoil them then yeah why are they [09:52] going to want to work for something [09:53] they have no motivation if you have [09:54] somebody new you you have your own uh [09:56] french ring club [09:57] we do so when you have somebody new [09:59] let's say somebody comes down they want [10:00] to join your club [10:01] and they have a brand new puppy what are [10:03] some of the first things you like to do [10:04] with a puppy when you're assessing them [10:06] to see if they are going to be a good [10:08] student for protection training or [10:09] french ring [10:10] so the first thing that i do is check [10:12] the dog's socialization i want to see [10:13] their confidence i want to see how they [10:14] react coming to a new field how they are [10:17] around new people how they are with some [10:19] different sounds and then usually i'll [10:20] have the owners just kind of show me [10:22] what they've done with the dog [10:23] if that means luring with food if that [10:24] means nothing if that means just playing [10:26] with the dog [10:26] i just want to see their relationship [10:29] and then [10:30] usually we will check the dog's food [10:31] drive i'll have them do a couple little [10:33] healing exercises just following the [10:35] food [10:36] um might start introducing a clicker [10:38] i'll bring out a toy and see [10:40] how willing they are to bring something [10:41] back if something gets thrown [10:43] or if they take it off and they're super [10:44] independent um [10:46] and then we kind of go from there we [10:48] also usually will check the dog's prey [10:50] drive just with a little third pole [10:52] with a tug on the end and just kind of [10:53] whip it back and forth and see if the [10:55] dog is motivated to chase or not [10:58] some dogs in certain lines are a little [10:59] bit slower to mature like german [11:00] shepherds in general are slower to [11:02] mature than melon was [11:03] there's still some malinois lines that [11:05] like the nvpk the [11:07] real belgian lines are slower to mature [11:09] than the french lines [11:11] so if i know the pedigree i know the [11:12] parents if i know [11:14] some of those things that's easier to to [11:16] kind of help shape the dog because i [11:18] know genetically [11:19] what they're more predisposed to have in [11:21] terms of their development [11:23] some dogs are just like the hardest dog [11:26] to train is a dog that is very [11:28] confident and independent and doesn't [11:30] have a lot of drive [11:31] because they don't need you and they [11:32] don't care so those types of dogs i want [11:35] them [11:36] skinny and hungry i want them [11:39] crated coming out for play going back in [11:41] the crate or a kennel run [11:43] um i want those types of dogs to fall in [11:47] love with their handler i want them to [11:48] look for their handler for everything [11:49] because i know genetically [11:51] they're more predisposed to have a lot [11:53] of independence [11:54] and for french ring because in a ring [11:56] three routine you're looking at about 45 [11:57] minutes [11:58] no rewards no corrections just you and [12:00] the dog you have to have a good [12:02] relationship [12:03] so that's the biggest thing in french [12:04] ring is you have to have [12:07] the dog has to like you at least a [12:09] little bit yeah for sure [12:11] with french ring uh let's actually talk [12:13] a little bit about the sports [12:14] you just mentioned uh french ring three [12:16] that's the top level and it usually [12:18] takes anywhere from what 40 to 50 [12:20] minutes on average somewhere between [12:22] that to complete the entire yeah just [12:23] depends on how [12:24] the judge has everything laid out if [12:25] it's a very fluid trial it's going to be [12:27] a little bit shorter if one exercise is [12:29] starting across the field the next one [12:30] starts the opposite [12:31] there's a lot of walking between [12:32] exercises but most most time on a ring [12:34] three if you've got a full [12:35] day the judge will set it up where it's [12:38] very fluid [12:38] and so it's going to go a little bit [12:39] faster so french ring sport [12:42] is a essentially it's a breed test that [12:45] was originated in france [12:46] you've got agility obedience and [12:49] protection [12:50] unlike schutzender igp or ipo whatever [12:53] they call it now [12:53] it's all fluid so you go from your jumps [12:56] to your obedience to your protection or [12:58] your bite work [12:59] it's not one portion and then the [13:01] afternoon do another portion the next [13:02] day you do another portion [13:04] so for the dogs it tests control a lot [13:06] because as the dogs get better they [13:08] understand [13:09] after my jumps we have an obedience and [13:11] after the obedience we go to bite work [13:12] so you'll see some of the dogs that are [13:15] a little bit more [13:15] full of themselves after the jumps they [13:18] start looking for [13:19] the decoy i've seen a dog do the hurdle [13:21] and then turn that into a search [13:23] because they they've heard the bite work [13:25] going on before they know that if they [13:26] hurry up and get through that stuff they [13:28] get to the good stuff the protection [13:29] work [13:30] so it's it's it's it's a very difficult [13:34] test to test the dog's athleticism with [13:36] the [13:37] agility portion so you've got a hurdle [13:39] how far is that jump [13:41] the long jump so the broad jumps you've [13:42] got the hurdle which the max height is [13:44] 1.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 40/841,3 meters so you have to [13:57] have a very athletic dog to do the work [13:59] and they have to have good technique [14:01] because it's not something that's just [14:02] easy for every dog to fly over [14:04] i'm very confident especially the high [14:06] wall yeah with that one so there's a lot [14:08] of [14:08] um debate on whether or not you should [14:11] have a puppy [14:12] practicing any sort of jumps because [14:14] their hips are still developing yeah [14:16] is that something how would you work [14:18] around that when you're trying to [14:20] train a puppy for a french ring and you [14:22] want to get them to like the jumps [14:24] and have that good positive association [14:26] with it during the imprinting stage but [14:27] still not overdoing it to a point where [14:29] you may [14:30] hurt the hips at least that's something [14:31] that people discuss quite often [14:33] yeah so you you definitely want to [14:34] respect the dog's body number one [14:36] so i think in our our video we talked [14:38] about a lot like not overheating your [14:40] dog watching signs for overheating [14:42] watching you know what your dog's normal [14:44] is in terms of their gait [14:45] um look for any abnormalities make sure [14:47] you're warming up your dog make sure [14:48] you're [14:49] giving them water if they need it and [14:50] make sure that you're cooling them down [14:51] after [14:52] so a lot of people pull their dog out of [14:53] the car from training they go straight [14:55] to the field [14:55] they don't potty their dog they don't [14:57] stretch them they don't do [14:58] any kind of tug warm-ups and you can [15:00] make a lot of problems that way [15:02] um is padding on the field and enqueue [15:04] for french ring it's not it's five [15:05] points it's five points yeah [15:07] it's enqueue and igp i believe right i'm [15:09] not sure about that [15:10] okay but it's non-qualifier disqualified [15:13] it's five points [15:14] but say you're doing a search the dog is [15:17] doing the search they stop and take a [15:18] dump and they forget what they're doing [15:21] you very well could lose that whole [15:22] exercise or if they stop and go to the [15:24] bathroom and then they displace more [15:26] than however many meters [15:27] you can have problems or if you're doing [15:30] your healing and leash gets tight [15:32] again you lose all those points so just [15:34] going to the bathroom [15:35] is the five points but in the big [15:37] picture it can cost you a lot [15:38] way more yeah so make sure that you warm [15:41] up your dog [15:41] cool them down let make sure they go [15:43] potty um [15:44] all of those things before you go on the [15:46] field and that even goes with basic pet [15:48] training too i mean sometimes if you [15:50] have [15:51] a dog that you're training and this goes [15:52] with any dog trainer whether [15:54] they're a professional dog trainer out [15:56] there or a personal dog trainer they're [15:58] just training their own pets [15:59] it's still important to start to [16:01] recognize little things like that [16:02] if so for example one of my puppies that [16:05] i trained [16:06] back in 2012 if i had her in a stay [16:09] whether it was a sit stay or down stay [16:11] she was really good at the stage but [16:12] every now and then she would randomly [16:14] get up [16:15] and at first i didn't know what it was [16:16] because i really wasn't able to read her [16:18] and i found out every time she got up [16:19] and started walking around it was [16:20] because she had to go to the bathroom [16:22] or i've had other dogs where they just [16:24] did not seem with it that day and it's [16:26] because they were [16:26] sick so being of course very aware of [16:29] your dog is important because then you [16:30] don't want to get that [16:31] negative association to training because [16:33] they're feeling bad and this actually [16:35] brings me to [16:36] teething this is another big question [16:38] that's asked quite often is [16:40] should i still play tug with my puppy [16:42] when they're going through teething [16:43] what's the best way to assess it to make [16:45] sure i'm not creating any sort of bad [16:47] associate [16:48] not i'm not creating any bad association [16:50] like what's the best way to approach it [16:51] when you have a puppy that's teething [16:53] and you want to do bites so there's [16:54] there's a lot that's a question it [16:57] depends on who you ask [16:58] for me it also depends on the dog so [17:00] some dogs can bite and their teeth are [17:02] falling off in the sleeve and they leave [17:04] it all bloody because their [17:05] teeth are falling out and they're just [17:06] bleeding everywhere and they don't care [17:08] you get some dogs they bite they top [17:11] they pop a tooth it hurts and now [17:13] they're really munchy and they don't [17:14] have a good bite because [17:16] it hurts and so if you train that dog [17:19] that gets munchie [17:20] through that teething you it's very [17:22] possible every time that you train [17:24] you're teaching the dog to have that [17:25] negative association with the biting or [17:28] you're teaching them to do this a lot [17:29] which you don't want [17:30] so for me it's not worth it i don't i [17:34] find that if the dog [17:35] is a good dog genetically you can stop [17:37] as soon as they start teething [17:39] focus on your obedience which is a good [17:41] time to just focus on obedience that way [17:43] you know the dog bites [17:44] they've already been exposed to the [17:45] stick i usually expose them to the [17:48] gunfire beforehand [17:49] they take that nice break from you know [17:51] four to six months [17:52] while they're finishing all their teeth [17:54] once their teeth are grown in then we'll [17:55] start by work again [17:57] but that's a nice month and a half or [17:59] two months where i can really focus on [18:00] my obedience [18:01] um and that way when they do start [18:04] teething i know that they have their [18:05] full teeth and they're not gonna be [18:06] sliding off the bite just because they [18:08] don't have any teeth to hold on to [18:09] i know that they can give me nice full [18:11] pressure and then i can build that fight [18:12] that way [18:12] so i i don't i i don't think that [18:15] there's any reason [18:16] if you have a dog like a beaceron or a [18:18] german shepherd or something that you [18:20] need [18:20] to kind of build up and you need that [18:22] time frustration frustration frustration [18:24] so bring them out let another dog watch [18:26] you know tease them for a bite have them [18:28] go to the car or [18:30] see them for a bite let them win you [18:31] know they grab it no tension on there [18:33] and let them carry it to the car [18:34] um that way you're not working on the [18:37] tugging you're not working on the [18:38] gripping you're just [18:39] that initial bite and carry that's it [18:41] and if you're doing that there shouldn't [18:42] be any negative associations but [18:44] sometimes like the beaucerons [18:45] some german shepherds they need that [18:48] they need that build up to maintain that [18:50] that motivation kind of that right yeah [18:52] some of the other dogs may not need [18:53] especially if you do a really nice job [18:55] with the imprinting yeah [18:56] because usually the imprinting is [18:57] completed before they even start [18:59] teething right or it's near the end of [19:00] the imprinting stage so [19:02] sometimes yeah it just depends so a lot [19:03] of dogs will work like in french ring we [19:05] use a lot of prey drive [19:06] and the prey drives just their [19:08] compulsion to bite and catch things that [19:09] are moving [19:10] so if the dog has a lot of prey drive [19:12] you really don't need [19:14] to do that during that break if you have [19:15] a dog that has again [19:17] a lot of times beauceron's german [19:18] shepherds they have some prey drive but [19:21] they really do [19:22] well with frustration that frustration [19:25] can again build that drive and that's [19:27] where i would work them during teething [19:28] but just [19:29] frustration frustration frustration [19:31] watching other dogs work [19:33] really building that up and that way [19:34] when they do finish their teething and [19:36] they're ready they're like [19:37] let me have it because they've been [19:38] frustrated the last month so that it [19:40] really helps them kind of bring it if [19:42] they need it [19:43] malin wants if you do too much of that [19:44] you just make them crazy and hectic and [19:45] then good luck controlling them after [19:47] that [19:47] so it just depends on the dog but too [19:50] much frustration [19:52] in a sport like french ring that you [19:53] really need control is not a good thing [19:56] something i thought was really cool too [19:57] when we were filming uh even when you [19:59] just brought out the puppy you're [20:00] working with the puppy [20:01] a lot of the things that you're doing of [20:03] course you don't [20:05] you don't just do them all at once the [20:07] very first time you introduce them and [20:09] then you bring it together that's how [20:10] you start to get that final picture [20:12] but a lot of the stuff you're doing is a [20:13] lot of things of course that i've [20:15] already taught on my youtube channel too [20:16] like the place bowl [20:17] but then seeing it in different [20:18] applications because like let's say for [20:20] example in my video [20:21] i use it more for the heel position [20:23] teaching the dog to flip in the heel [20:25] teaching the dog the rear end awareness [20:27] and doing an exercise that's fun but [20:29] then using that to help with the jumps [20:31] or using it to help with just proper [20:33] position [20:34] it's cool to see how all these different [20:36] tools come together in order to help [20:38] teach a dog [20:39] a specific task that you're working on [20:40] yeah so i mean something as simple as [20:42] like targeting a replaceable [20:44] um you can use it for fronts you can use [20:47] it for healing you can use it for [20:49] a position for your jumps you can use it [20:52] for [20:52] object guard you can use it for like a [20:54] position sit down stand to keep the dog [20:56] from creeping forward [20:58] you could use it for a send away you can [20:59] use it for [21:01] so many for so many different things um [21:04] you could use it for your um [21:05] unseen or i'm sorry your scene retrieve [21:07] to teach the dog to go out in front of [21:09] you to come back [21:10] so it's it's it's a nice foundation [21:12] behavior that i'll use for a lot of [21:14] things [21:14] so all of the things that i do with my [21:17] early puppy in printing [21:18] there are things that i'm going to use [21:19] everywhere so i really want the dog to [21:21] be like a magnet to their place board i [21:23] want them to see it and run to it and [21:24] put their paws on like what are we going [21:25] to do [21:26] because i'm going to use that in a lot [21:27] of different places same thing with [21:29] my front position i'm going to use that [21:30] for my retrieves i'm going to use that [21:32] for my recall i'm going to use that for [21:34] the escort [21:35] i'm going to use it for a lot of [21:36] different places so i want my dog [21:37] comfortable being really close [21:39] you know right in in that front area or [21:41] behind depending on where i want them [21:42] for the escort same thing i'll do the [21:44] healing on my right heel on the left [21:45] just to keep the dog balanced and if i'm [21:47] going to use that for my escort [21:50] so it's a lot of my puppy stuff is going [21:52] to be used in a lot of different places [21:55] so i just want them happily doing that [21:56] and happy to do the work but to go back [21:58] to [21:59] we were talking about jumps earlier um [22:01] about what age [22:02] i start the jumps so i don't start jumps [22:05] into i'll do my foundation stuff [22:07] just with targets going back and forth [22:09] but no no jumping at all until they're [22:11] at least a year [22:12] if i have a dog that's going to be like [22:14] an 80-pound dog i'll wait even longer [22:16] because i want them to finish growing [22:18] um jumps are not hard to teach if the [22:20] dog is athletic [22:21] teaching them not to touch and to go [22:23] over in place and come back is not [22:25] difficult [22:26] um but if you jump too early and you [22:28] make problems [22:29] then it's much more difficult to fix [22:31] later um and it's one of those [22:33] situations where [22:35] there are rules in terms of you know you [22:37] can't touch it either [22:38] the broad jump or the hurdle and so you [22:41] are adding a little bit of stress in [22:42] terms of [22:44] if you make a mistake so some dogs when [22:46] they do the hurdle if they hit it [22:47] they're like oh i hit it i'm sorry [22:49] and if the puppy isn't mentally mature [22:51] enough you can make problems [22:53] if the dog doesn't care they're just a [22:54] brute they're just crashing through it [22:56] and then you can make problems that way [22:58] so i like to wait mentally for the dog [23:00] to be a year and physically i like them [23:02] to be a year [23:02] but before that i can teach them the [23:04] pattern of i stand in the middle [23:06] i have one target on one side one target [23:08] on the other side and i say go target [23:10] the dog goes across and it [23:11] goes there and i tell them stay and they [23:13] take a down position i can say go target [23:15] and they'll go back [23:16] and i can practice that whole the whole [23:18] pattern without there actually being a [23:20] jump [23:20] um i like that too when you're filming [23:23] that i thought that was really cool [23:25] another thing i noticed too is you also [23:26] start retrieval training very early [23:29] but you make it a game yep it's just [23:31] fetch it's i can teach the dog to hold [23:34] but i want them to want to bring it to [23:36] me i want them [23:37] to to feel comfortable as soon as they [23:39] grab it it's not time to go check out [23:40] and see what else is going on [23:42] i want them to come back like you see in [23:44] the video that we do i sit down with [23:45] them i let them jump on me i pet them [23:47] while they're holding it [23:48] then i'll take it and i'll throw it [23:49] again that way they're not trying to [23:51] play keep away and being too possessive [23:52] of it thinking that i'm just going to [23:54] take it from them [23:54] so i let them kind of possess it i'll [23:56] pet them with it i'll do a couple of [23:58] tugs or kind of poke at it just to make [23:59] sure that i've got that firm grip [24:02] my friend sarah parelli um and her [24:05] boyfriend marco [24:06] have a um website called [24:10] i think it's kinemo canomo [24:13] and they have a really good retrieve [24:16] uh series and i've picked some parts of [24:18] their how they do their retrieve for ipo [24:21] because ipo you can't have any kind of [24:23] munching and they have a lot of points [24:24] on those retrieves so i like to pick [24:26] certain things from different trainers [24:28] because i'm always learning [24:29] and i look at sports that are really [24:31] judged highly on those parts that i'm [24:34] picking from so if i want a dog that's [24:37] like an object guard for example in [24:40] french ring is always just a basket [24:42] in another sport called mandia ring it [24:43] can be anything so sometimes it can [24:45] depending on what their theme is [24:47] so for example if it was um [24:50] gosh i've seen strollers being used i've [24:52] used a bicycle i've used a trash [24:54] i've seen a trash can with balloons on [24:56] it so if i was gonna really [24:58] try to train a basket i'm going to look [25:00] at a sport like mondeo that has a lot of [25:02] distractions they have more than one [25:03] decoy it's [25:04] their object guard is harder than french [25:06] ring so when i'm trying to teach my [25:08] object guard i'm going to take parts of [25:09] mondea ring sport if i'm looking to do [25:13] you know retrieving i'm gonna pick parts [25:15] from either akc obedience that has some [25:16] retrieves [25:17] or i'm gonna pick it from ipo or igp [25:19] that has a lot of emphasis on those [25:21] retrieves [25:22] if i'm looking at doing agility or my [25:24] broad jump i'm gonna look at agility [25:26] sports and how those trainers do it so [25:28] i'm always looking at different sports [25:30] different dog sports and picking [25:31] different things to see what i can use [25:34] to help [25:34] my dogs do better in this board if i [25:37] train just for french ring i'm staying [25:39] in my little bubble and i'm not [25:40] expanding and learning as much as i can [25:42] if i look at akc trainers [25:44] if i look at agility trainers if i look [25:46] at igp even if i have no interest in [25:47] playing those sports [25:48] there's always something that you can [25:50] pick and learn to make yourself a better [25:51] trainer [25:52] so i'm always looking at other people [25:55] and trying to [25:56] pick what i can and apply it where i can [25:58] i couldn't agree more i'm constantly [26:00] looking at different sports and seeing [26:01] what they're doing [26:02] i started off doing psa which i had a [26:04] blast doing that and then learning about [26:06] french ring i'm like oh my gosh this is [26:07] amazing [26:08] and then of course igp as well as doing [26:11] akc [26:12] and having all that experience i think [26:14] definitely helps but constantly learning [26:16] something else that you did when you [26:17] were working with the puppy and uh you [26:19] worked with a few puppies when we were [26:21] filming [26:21] but this is something that i'm often [26:23] asked you're probably asked this as well [26:25] people have issues with things such as [26:27] recall or some of the really simple [26:29] commands [26:29] and it's because they're asking their [26:31] dogs or their puppies to do [26:33] certain things without having a way to [26:35] reinforce it [26:36] especially in the early stages so i [26:38] believe you had one puppy that wasn't as [26:40] good as coming [26:41] back to you as the other one yeah and so [26:42] you had a long line on that puppy and [26:44] you were able to use that to help direct [26:46] and guide the dog so the dog was [26:47] successful how important is it to [26:50] recognize something like that when [26:51] you're working with dogs to make sure [26:53] you're constantly setting them up for [26:54] success in the beginning [26:56] of course there's times when we set them [26:57] up for failure as well for [26:59] certain things like i said dogs up for [27:00] failure when i'm potty training them [27:02] so i can have an opportunity like hey [27:04] don't do that inside the house but more [27:06] importantly [27:06] for obedience and recall is a really big [27:09] one whether it's for a sport or [27:11] you know somebody's own personal dog [27:13] they expect the dog to always come to [27:14] them [27:15] and they're like why doesn't my dog come [27:16] to me i have my dog in the yard running [27:18] around playing but the dog doesn't come [27:20] to me [27:20] what are some of your recommendations [27:22] for that especially with the recall [27:24] because that is so important [27:25] so three three kind of rules and [27:27] hopefully i'll remember the third [27:28] because i [27:29] just drew a blank but three three rules [27:31] for training if anybody listened to [27:34] nothing else but took these rules they [27:35] would be [27:36] fine so don't give commands unless [27:38] you're willing and able to follow [27:39] through [27:41] so if the dog is in the backyard barking [27:42] at the squirrel on the fence and you [27:44] know they're not going to come [27:45] don't call them you know they're not [27:46] going to come all it does is teach the [27:48] dog that they don't have to [27:49] and that they can keep blow you off and [27:50] keep doing whatever they're doing so if [27:52] you know that the dog isn't gonna follow [27:54] through [27:54] don't call them and a lot of people have [27:57] such a hard time with that [27:58] letting that dog bark at the fence and [28:00] not going out there and yelling [28:02] at them or saying come 20 time like let [28:04] it go [28:05] the next time you let the dog out you [28:06] put a 20-foot line on them and before [28:08] you call them you walk to the end of it [28:10] and you pick it up [28:11] then you call your dog to come with your [28:12] treats in your pocket or your toy or [28:14] whatever you set yourself up to succeed [28:15] if you know the dog [28:16] isn't gonna do it you forgot to put the [28:18] leash on whatever you go i messed up [28:21] next time i'll be prepared and set [28:23] yourself up to succeed [28:24] by leaving your long leash by the back [28:26] door training call or [28:27] leash whatever you're gonna need make [28:29] sure that it's readily available if you [28:30] have to go find it every time you have [28:32] to let your dog out to go potty you're [28:33] less likely to follow through [28:34] so set yourself up to succeed another [28:36] thing that you talked about so number [28:38] one is don't give commands unless you're [28:39] willing and able to follow through [28:41] i couldn't agree more number two set the [28:44] dog up to succeed [28:45] when you're not paying attention and set [28:46] them up to fail when you are so if you [28:48] know that that dog [28:50] will blow you off with a squirrel again [28:52] set yourself up to succeed [28:53] in terms of when you do let the dog out [28:56] set them up [28:56] with a long line on so that we're able [28:58] to follow through and then [29:00] set them up to i'm sorry set them up to [29:02] fail when [29:03] you've got the line on them you know [29:04] they're going to blow you off so you've [29:05] got your leash on when you're ready to [29:06] go and then set yourself to succeed if [29:08] you know there's a squirrel out there [29:09] don't let the dog out [29:11] you know that they're just gonna blow [29:12] you off they're gonna go out there [29:13] barking same thing if i have a dog [29:14] like a pet dog that's jumping up on the [29:16] counters set the dog up to succeed don't [29:18] leave a sandwich up there unless you're [29:19] well you're ready to go [29:21] and then set the dog up to fail leave a [29:22] sandwich on there when you've got [29:24] whatever you have to correct the dog [29:26] and let the dog fail and learn that [29:27] there's consequences for that but if [29:29] sometimes the dog jumps up and eats a [29:30] sandwich and sometimes they jump up and [29:32] they get a correction [29:34] you're keeping that hope alive so that's [29:35] not good [29:37] so set the dog up to succeed set them up [29:38] to fail [29:40] and then the third one is freedom is [29:41] earned with good behavior so if the dog [29:43] hasn't earned [29:44] off-leash freedom don't give them [29:46] off-leash freedom [29:47] they have to earn it if your dog makes [29:50] very bad choices [29:51] and destroys your house don't leave them [29:52] free in the house they haven't earned [29:53] that freedom yet [29:55] so freedom is earned with good behavior [29:56] don't let that dog have more freedom and [29:58] they're willing to handle [29:59] and with puppies basically that means [30:01] none so my puppies are either [30:03] in a dog run or in an outside run that i [30:06] don't have to worry about them digging [30:07] up stuff [30:08] chewing on stuff they're not supposed to [30:09] they only have their toys they really [30:10] can't get into trouble [30:12] they're on a leash with me they're in an [30:14] exercise pen in the house [30:15] or they're on a leash but they don't [30:17] earn they don't have freedom [30:18] because they haven't earned it yet and [30:20] they're not able to practice bad [30:21] behaviors when you're not watching them [30:23] to bounce off of the very first rule [30:25] that you're talking about what are your [30:26] thoughts on [30:27] informal commands that's something i [30:29] often tell people like if you're not [30:31] ready to reinforce a command [30:33] use informal and for me an example of [30:36] informal is like come on guys [30:37] let's go let's go because that's not [30:39] really a command so if they don't listen [30:40] it's not like okay we're ruining [30:42] our formal commands but it still gives [30:44] us an opportunity to be lazy if we need [30:47] to yeah [30:48] what's your thought on that so like with [30:49] my my old melon all my old competition [30:51] dog grizzby he had [30:53] all of his um friend dream commands were [30:56] in french [30:56] and his informal commands were in [30:58] english so he knows let's go [31:00] come here but whistle is you know get [31:02] your butt over here and go into your [31:03] spot [31:04] opa means you know focused heel right on [31:06] my neck side let's go or with me [31:08] is just in this general vicinity [31:12] so yes it's possible but you're also [31:13] doubling up the amount of work [31:15] that you have to do so like i said go [31:18] lay down [31:19] versus coochie go lay down is you know [31:22] go find a spot and relax [31:24] down is drop wherever you are and those [31:26] elbows better hit the ground so it [31:28] really just depends make sure that you [31:30] are [31:30] are giving those commands and being [31:32] consistent with them [31:34] so if you can't be consistent with your [31:36] regular commands then yeah give yourself [31:38] informal commands that you can [31:40] mess with those but if i have a dog [31:42] that's out in the backyard i wouldn't [31:43] even call it an informal command if i [31:44] know that they're not going to come i go [31:47] you know whatever but i don't really [31:49] count that as an informal command i [31:50] count that as like [31:51] do what you have to do to get the dog [31:53] you know distracted and focused on you [31:55] and then get them inside [31:56] so i mean you can call whatever you want [31:58] but yeah i do have like my french [32:00] commands which are for a french ring [32:01] and that way i know that people are [32:02] gonna go you know sit sit sit to my [32:04] competition dog and mess things up [32:06] um so i like to have kind of my informal [32:09] commands in english and my competition [32:11] commands are in [32:13] french french it just makes it more [32:14] clear for me too because i'm not going [32:15] around the house [32:17] because i actually have to think when [32:19] i'm giving my commands versus a lot of [32:20] people are [32:21] you know down when the dog jumps up on [32:22] them right instead of [32:24] instead of off or no yeah so it's easier [32:27] to have it in a [32:28] separate language just because it makes [32:29] you think about it i'm not fluid in [32:31] german or in french i'm getting there [32:33] but [32:33] so it's a lot easier to use those [32:35] commands because the dog also [32:37] understands that i'm only talking to [32:38] them [32:39] when i'm speaking that language so i can [32:41] be talking to a pet client telling them [32:42] you know put your dog in a down and my [32:44] dog's not like oh were you talking to me [32:45] because he doesn't understand down and [32:47] this is cliche so it allows me [32:49] to to be able to go oh you know [32:53] it allows me to for my it allows my dog [32:55] to understand what i'm talking to them [32:57] because if they speak if they hear [32:58] french i'm only talking to them so it [33:00] makes it more clear [33:01] about the commands oh another thing that [33:03] i noticed that i really like about your [33:05] training style and how you work with [33:06] dogs is [33:07] you have each command sound very very [33:10] distinct [33:11] from one another and that's something [33:12] one of my biggest issues is i do make my [33:14] commands sound different from the way [33:16] that i talk but often my commands do [33:18] sound similar to each command [33:19] like i have the same voice down sit and [33:23] that's something i've been trying to [33:24] work on but yeah with you every command [33:26] is [33:26] so distinct in the way you say it and [33:29] how your rise and inflection of your [33:30] voice changes that it makes it so [33:32] incredibly clear [33:33] and it's one of the videos of yours that [33:35] you posted with uh [33:36] i think hammer you're giving the [33:38] commands and i shared i'm like you guys [33:40] need to check this out notice how she [33:41] says her commands yeah [33:42] very distinct and they're always the [33:44] same like your down always sounds the [33:46] same [33:46] that's something a lot of people [33:48] struggle with especially with verbal [33:50] markers [33:51] yes instead of yes [33:54] that's why clickers are are more clear [33:57] for the dog than a verbal marker [33:59] because unless you're going yes yes yes [34:01] yes [34:02] and you can be consistent with your [34:03] yeses and not yay like you were doing [34:06] it it makes it more clear like the click [34:08] is the same no matter if you hold it [34:09] down [34:10] or you're slower to click when it clicks [34:11] it's the exact same noise for the dogs [34:13] it's very clear [34:14] most people also unless you've got a [34:15] two-year-old aren't going around just [34:16] clicking the click [34:18] so it it makes it more clear like when [34:20] they hear that click that click is for [34:21] them [34:22] so like with grizzly my old competition [34:24] dog his verbal marker was [34:27] and that was what oh nice and that was [34:29] his you know [34:30] that was his click and it was just very [34:32] easy a lot of people use yes [34:34] but just that it makes it very easy [34:37] and it's quiet and i can use it to cue [34:39] some things [34:41] and so i i like something that's very [34:43] distinct sound versus [34:44] yes yes yes unless you can be very [34:47] consistent with your yeses [34:48] probably go yes yeah drag it out or [34:51] they're excited they go [34:52] yes yes yes right yeah so whatever your [34:55] markers are just be clear with them [34:57] um but that's the nice thing about the [34:58] french language also is in [35:00] in english like i have my my current [35:02] competition dog my german shepherd [35:04] um he was a pet dog before so he was [35:08] trained in english [35:08] so instead of trying to train everything [35:10] i said well just try keeping him in [35:11] english because it'll be easier [35:13] but um a lot of the [35:16] american commands or the english [35:17] commands are very similar [35:19] sit stand stay sit stand stay it's very [35:24] universal issues and spin yeah that's it [35:26] yeah stand [35:27] spin yeah so a lot of them they're all [35:29] ones all one syllable all very short [35:31] they all start with the s [35:32] so like for positions in french it's i [35:35] see [35:37] so it's very they also different words [35:39] they're all two syllables it's very easy [35:40] you know [35:41] sit stand down the sit stand stay [35:44] they're all very so what i'm doing it's [35:47] sit [35:47] i put emphasis on the i almost make it [35:49] into two syllables stand [35:51] sit stand so i can use my voice to help [35:54] the dog [35:55] kind of differentiate and then stay so i [35:58] use kind of a lower voice for my stay so [36:00] it makes a little bit more clear for the [36:01] dog what i want [36:02] but it's still french is just much [36:04] easier because they're all two-syllable [36:06] and they all have they the positions [36:08] start with different words are there [36:09] certain commands you are required [36:11] to use in french ring yes so if you look [36:14] at the rulebook there's there's [36:16] commands that you have to use so before [36:17] you start any sport [36:19] and especially if you're going to be in [36:21] a club that's serious about competing [36:22] read the rule book [36:24] because it's something that you can do [36:26] at home that you can understand if you [36:27] have questions you can always bring them [36:29] to the club and ask those questions [36:31] but if you ask questions that are in the [36:32] rule book that are [36:34] right there simply outlined but you just [36:35] have been too lazy to [36:37] go through and read you're wasting the [36:39] club's time if you're too lazy to look [36:41] it up on your own don't waste our time [36:43] you don't want to waste your time doing [36:44] the research don't waste our time asking [36:46] questions [36:46] french ring rules are difficult they are [36:48] difficult but again if at least if you [36:50] read through it [36:51] even if you don't understand everything [36:53] at least you go oh okay i remember that [36:55] because you have that to refer if you go [36:56] this is too hard i don't want to do it i [36:58] don't have the time i don't whatever [36:59] well don't waste our time [37:00] when you don't want to waste your own [37:01] personal time right you can also if you [37:03] have an iphone click on the audio [37:05] and it'll read the rules to you so even [37:09] now whenever i'm going to a competition [37:11] on my way there i'll you know copy i'll [37:13] select the audio or the speak [37:15] and my iphone will read the rules to me [37:17] just so that way i'm always kind of [37:18] getting refreshed on the rules but [37:21] rules can change too i mean yeah they [37:23] can change but [37:24] um in in general i mean since i've been [37:26] doing i don't think there's been [37:27] too many role changes um besides the [37:31] palestinians and some other things but [37:33] it's important though for any sport i [37:34] mean akc i believe they changed [37:36] a few rules since i started um yeah [37:40] and igp has changed theirs too i mean [37:41] they changed the name every other week [37:42] so [37:43] it's just read the rules even if you [37:46] have questions or have the rule book [37:47] printed out and that way when somebody's [37:49] talking you can flip through there and [37:50] read it [37:51] but at least understand kind of the [37:53] general [37:54] uh you know overall of what the rules [37:58] are [37:58] what the commands are because there are [37:59] a list of commands that you're allowed [38:00] to use depending on the language um [38:04] so this actually brings me to a very [38:07] interesting question i think is with the [38:09] stay so [38:10] in french ring they do require you to [38:12] say stay no [38:14] oh i thought they did no stay is [38:15] optional oh okay you have to give a [38:17] placement [38:18] so if you walk up to your start line and [38:19] the dog is already sitting [38:21] you still have to tell them to sit okay [38:23] but the stay is optional [38:24] okay i was i was thinking that the stay [38:26] was something you had to teach them [38:29] like that that word when you teach a dog [38:31] state do you use the stay [38:33] word or do you just require them to [38:35] maintain a position [38:36] if you give them a commanded position [38:38] such as sit or down or place [38:40] so i almost use it as an extra command [38:43] so [38:44] i do teach an implied but then i also [38:46] teach them stay [38:47] um so like for french ring you are [38:50] allowed to [38:52] so you're allowed to say stay right so [38:54] if we're doing the food refusal [38:55] which essentially i walking my dog i [38:57] tell them to down [38:58] you can tell them to stay and then you [39:00] go behind a blind and somebody comes up [39:02] and tries to get your dog to eat the [39:03] food they throw a couple pieces of [39:05] depending on the level buffet it's one [39:06] piece ring one two [39:08] three is all four pieces of food so [39:11] if i want to give myself an extra [39:13] command [39:14] in french for state you can either use [39:16] rest or pabouje [39:18] one is stay and the other ones don't [39:20] move so you can say either one of those [39:21] commands [39:22] okay so i can teach my dog that pabouje [39:24] means leave it [39:25] see i like that because so i'm not i'm [39:28] not breaking the rules but my dog [39:30] knows that papaji means leave it so i [39:32] can tell my dog that hey this is going [39:33] to be the food refusal [39:35] as i walk up i can tell them couches and [39:37] they go okay [39:38] leave it and then without [39:41] giving an extra command i'm commanding [39:43] my dog that this is the food refusal and [39:45] leave it without breaking any of the [39:46] rules [39:47] same thing on my jumps so on the jumps [39:50] um the dog jumps again you don't have to [39:52] say stay [39:53] but if my stay means down i'm able to [39:56] anchor my dog here [39:57] because you're not allowed to stay down [39:59] but you can give an optional stay [40:00] command [40:01] i really like that you say that because [40:03] something that i constantly [40:05] tell people when i'm training them and [40:06] in my stay video i say i don't use the [40:08] word stay [40:10] because i feel it doesn't make much [40:12] sense in a dog's mind if we look at the [40:13] concept of predictability [40:15] and that's how our dogs learn what words [40:17] mean words mean essentially what they [40:19] predict to the dog [40:20] so if you think about every word we use [40:22] sit down come heal spin roll over play [40:24] dead even our markers yes everything [40:25] predicts something [40:27] and then we say stay and it doesn't [40:28] predict anything it doesn't change the [40:30] situation [40:31] and what i've told people is oh i have [40:32] trainer friends for example that will [40:34] teach stay but they teach stay [40:36] as a commanded position such as a sit or [40:39] as you set it down [40:40] or leave it so i i still i do say stay [40:43] um but like if if i put my dog [40:47] and i said say i'm training i say down [40:49] stay and i walk away if the dog got up i [40:50] wouldn't say stay [40:52] i would say down down okay because stay [40:55] there like we'll stay standing [40:56] stay what for me stay essentially is [40:58] just telling that there's gonna be [40:59] duration [41:00] or like just maintain or freeze in that [41:02] position in a sense yeah so if your [41:03] dog's walking and you say stay would [41:05] your dog have to stop moving [41:08] technically so that so then at that [41:11] point you are [41:12] using stay as predicting something it is [41:14] predicting [41:15] something to change the current [41:17] situation the dog is in [41:19] and i think that's important to be able [41:20] to recognize that and i [41:22] i love the fact that you said that you [41:23] use it uh well which one dad [41:25] what is it sorry papaji i would say for [41:28] the uh [41:28] leave it which is it's brilliant i mean [41:31] and that's how [41:32] the top dog trainers do it they find [41:34] ways to use the rules [41:35] correctly if you know the rules exactly [41:37] and then use it to get the best possible [41:39] results and talking about predictability [41:41] i do want to talk a little bit [41:42] more about the come when called again i [41:44] think it's one of the most [41:46] important commands whether it's for [41:47] sport or personal yeah i agree um [41:50] what are some of the things some of the [41:51] things that i've seen personally why [41:53] people cause problems with their come [41:54] when called is because of that concept [41:57] of predictability but in a way that [41:58] doesn't benefit [41:59] the owner so for example they have their [42:02] dog at the dog park i don't recommend [42:04] dog parks but [42:04] you know dogs love dog parks right and [42:07] let's say somebody has their dog at the [42:08] dog park and the reason why let's just [42:10] touch on that real quick the reason why [42:11] i don't like recommending dog parks is [42:12] because i don't know the dogs there [42:14] i don't know if they're sick i don't [42:15] want them to attack a dog that i'm [42:17] taking there and they have a bad [42:18] experience you kind of feel the same way [42:19] yeah [42:20] but let's say someone has their dog yeah [42:22] we'll make that rule number four no dog [42:23] parks [42:25] or let's say the dog's at any park an [42:26] open field and the dog's having a good [42:28] time and they're running around and [42:30] they're playing [42:30] and the owner calls the dog to them the [42:32] dog comes to them they hook the leash on [42:34] them and they leave [42:35] yeah they just punish the dog they [42:36] taught the dog yeah if you come to me [42:38] the fun's over [42:39] and i see that all the time same thing [42:41] when the dog is at the house i talk [42:43] about this with potty training dog goes [42:45] potty for the very first time they take [42:46] the dog inside and put the dog in the [42:47] crate [42:48] well now the dog's not or the dog that's [42:50] barking the squirrel same thing the dog [42:52] does come they just end play time [42:53] because they lock the dog in the house [42:54] and dogs like well i'm definitely not [42:56] gonna come next time yeah [42:58] what are some other things that you may [42:59] have seen with people using [43:01] or improperly communicating with their [43:03] dog like here's another one [43:04] that i've seen before is um someone's [43:07] trying to get something from their dog [43:08] let's say the dog picks up something has [43:10] it in their mouth and they're trying to [43:11] get it back from the dog [43:12] yeah they finally get it back from the [43:14] dog and then they correct the dog [43:16] well what did they just teach the dog [43:17] yeah when you finally let it go you get [43:18] corrected and then they want to hold on [43:20] to it [43:20] even longer what are some things you ran [43:22] into people that you've trained or [43:24] taught how to train [43:25] that is something that may be common [43:27] mistakes and [43:28] just personal training or even french [43:30] ring it's not about you [43:32] it's about the dog a lot of people oh i [43:34] got these treats and they're you know [43:36] little milk bones or something and the [43:37] dog doesn't give two shits about it [43:39] it's not about you it's about the dog [43:40] what does the dog want what does the dog [43:42] like does the dog like the string cheese [43:44] does dog like hot dogs does the dog like [43:46] chicken strips what does the dog like [43:48] i've had clients that have to go to [43:49] mcdonald's and get you know sausage [43:50] mcmuffins before training because their [43:52] dogs have [43:53] no food motivation you know grandma [43:55] keeps feeding them at home and so they [43:56] have to just use super high value [43:58] treats and it is what it is you know you [44:00] have to do what you have to do chicken [44:01] nuggets [44:02] you know flying dutchmen puppy patties [44:05] whatever like [44:05] find something that your dog actually [44:07] likes and use that as motivation [44:09] if your dog likes to run laps around the [44:10] field then use that as a reward the dog [44:12] comes [44:13] great break let them do their laps call [44:14] them back do some healing great break [44:16] they get to go back out and do it what [44:18] does your dog like does your dog like to [44:19] chase stuff does your dog like to eat [44:20] does your dog like to [44:22] play or you know tug fight what does [44:25] your dog like and use that as the reward [44:27] a lot of people like to use petting the [44:29] dogs don't like petting half the time [44:31] um some some do but when they're doing [44:35] bite work they [44:36] don't want to come back for cuddle time [44:37] right they want they want yeah good job [44:39] this is football season they don't want [44:41] to [44:41] just like a football player doesn't want [44:42] to go on the sideline and hug their [44:44] girlfriend and cuddle for five minutes [44:45] right they slap their butts [44:46] yeah you know be bomb chest like it's a [44:48] more worked up situation so you have to [44:50] match the dog's intensity and give them [44:52] what they want in that moment [44:53] so sometimes the dog comes back you know [44:55] yeah i pat them on the side and i'll [44:56] push them away from me they'll come back [44:58] and [44:58] you know do this and really play with [45:00] them because that's what they want [45:01] if the dog wants a toy and i'm like well [45:03] here take some food sometimes i'm [45:05] punishing the dog [45:06] i'm making them take a lower value and [45:07] they really don't want that so think [45:09] about what the dog wants in that [45:11] situation and try to reward with that [45:14] at the same time talking about switching [45:16] from food to toys [45:18] for me a dog is balanced when they can [45:20] switch back and forth [45:22] if a dog refuses to drink water because [45:24] they're so worked up you know that [45:25] they're tired and they're super thirsty [45:27] but there's a decoy in the field so they [45:28] refuse to drink water it's very common [45:30] in the protection sports for me the dog [45:32] is [45:33] imbalanced you need to have more control [45:35] the dog needs to be more in a thinking [45:37] state of mind [45:37] because their brain is off or if you [45:40] offer [45:40] a dog a piece of steak and they're like [45:42] no there's a decoy over there [45:44] your value needs to be transferred more [45:46] to yourself than it is the decoy [45:48] so usually if the dogs can't switch back [45:50] and forth and they normally have really [45:52] high food drive [45:53] i'll work more on obedience than drive [45:56] for the decoy [45:57] to maintain some of that create the [45:58] balance yeah [46:00] and a lot of times i don't even use food [46:01] for later training but [46:03] you'll see um there's a terveiran [46:06] in my old club that used to refuse to [46:08] take water when there was bite work [46:10] going on i mean the dog would be [46:11] dead tired you know eyes red just tongue [46:14] hanging out but that dog would not drink [46:16] water [46:16] if there was bite work then how would [46:19] you get to drink water you had to take [46:20] it off the field [46:21] no the dog just wouldn't drink oh wow [46:23] and so the dog [46:24] i mean you really run the risk of [46:26] overheating the dog and making problems [46:28] because the dog is so [46:30] imbalanced because they want to bite so [46:32] bad that you [46:33] run either having to abandon if the dog [46:35] is you know starting a heat stroke or [46:36] something [46:37] because the dog won't even drink water [46:39] so it's really important that for me [46:41] it's important that you should be able [46:42] to switch between [46:43] doing food stuff to be able to do bite [46:45] work stuff and be able to go from doing [46:47] a bite work exercise so now we're going [46:48] to do the hurdle [46:50] even with the decoy in the field and psa [46:51] is great at that right you're doing [46:53] obedience thing all the decoys are yeah [46:55] you know yelling and and trying to [46:57] encourage the dog to bite [46:58] and the dog has to be clear enough to [46:59] stay focused on the task at hand [47:01] um and in order to do that you have to [47:02] have a very balanced dog you can't have [47:04] a monster for the bite [47:05] and lose all that control so i like [47:08] certain again i like that aspect of that [47:10] sport and campaign [47:11] which is another french sport is also [47:13] very like that where you can switch from [47:15] a jump to a protection and now two more [47:17] obedience [47:18] and then a bite and then a jump and you [47:20] have to have a very balanced dog that [47:22] can go from [47:23] working to off and then working to off [47:25] and police dogs are the same way [47:27] they can't be i want to buy own a bite [47:28] on a bike they have to stay [47:30] calm enough so that way they're not just [47:31] spinning in their car all day and then [47:33] they have no energy when they do come [47:34] out [47:35] to work so for me it's very important [47:37] that you maintain [47:39] that balance um or else you don't have a [47:41] dog that you can go [47:42] the long run with because the dog is [47:44] just so out of whack that they can't [47:46] you know sometimes even just drink water [47:47] and speaking of rewards this is another [47:50] common question that's asked [47:51] you start off with continual [47:52] reinforcement you're rewarding the dog [47:55] what is your best way or how do you like [47:57] to explain to people [47:59] the best process for spacing out those [48:00] rewards i love the analogy that you told [48:02] me years ago and i tell [48:04] everybody this analogy the piece of cake [48:06] no no the one when they start out they [48:07] want to be a vending machine [48:09] but as the dog gets better they have to [48:11] transfer into a slot machine yeah [48:12] or the dog thinks there's the [48:14] possibility they're going to get a [48:15] reward but [48:16] they're not going to get it every time [48:18] but that belief that the reward is [48:19] possible [48:20] is what continues that motivation yeah [48:22] how do you explain to [48:23] your students and because you train [48:25] trainers too what do you do to teach [48:27] them that [48:28] so little kids right they go to [48:31] kindergarten they get participation [48:32] awards everybody gets stickers for [48:34] everything that you do and you get [48:35] smiley you know [48:37] faces on your homework there's a lot of [48:38] positive reinforcement and then when [48:40] you're in college you're just expected [48:41] to do your work [48:42] but you don't skip from kindergarten on [48:44] that continuous reinforcement or a puppy [48:46] where you're [48:47] reinforcing every reward to just stop [48:49] reinforcing right [48:50] there's a gradual you know progression [48:53] in those rewards so how i kind of decide [48:57] does the dog need a reward or not [48:59] as if it's a piece of cake so if it's a [49:01] piece of cake they don't need one [49:02] right if they sit before they jump in [49:04] the crate you don't need to give them [49:06] a treat for that the reward is just [49:07] getting into the crate because then they [49:08] get to go to training [49:09] um or if the dog i've had been having [49:12] problems with the dog in the backyard [49:14] barking the squirrel there's a call my [49:16] dog to come and they come [49:17] that's a big deal i'm going to make sure [49:19] that i pay them for that because that [49:20] was not an easy choice [49:22] if the dog just finished potty and [49:23] they're already coming my direction and [49:24] i call them to come [49:25] i'm not going to give them a treat for [49:26] that that wasn't hard for them [49:28] so i'm only going to reward where [49:32] i know that it was a hard choice for [49:33] them and they made the right choice [49:35] and then i'm going to pay them for that [49:37] do you have a way where you start to [49:38] recognize as well with [49:40] i like that you say it's easy uh or if [49:42] the command is easy for the dog so do [49:43] you mean like [49:45] for example you say down the dog just [49:46] lays down you don't have to assist the [49:48] dog you don't have to help with the [49:49] physical cue [49:50] they just start to do it that's kind of [49:52] the indication that it's becoming easy [49:54] yeah so like all um i'll we'll talk [49:57] about auto sits [49:58] um as an example so an auto sit is when [50:00] the dog automatically sits when you stop [50:02] when you're healing [50:03] so if i'm doing my healing and i'm [50:05] teaching the dog usually i walk when i [50:06] stop i pull up the dog sits i reward [50:08] them [50:09] i'll do that i'll continually do that [50:11] and then i'll start fading my hand [50:12] signal [50:13] and then if the dog sits on their own [50:15] i'll reward them if i have to help them [50:16] and i'll lure them i usually won't [50:18] reward them at that point so now i'm [50:20] switching to [50:21] from rewarding them every single time [50:23] and helping them every single time [50:24] to fading my hand signal and if they [50:27] offer it on their own [50:28] giving them that treat if i have to help [50:30] them i'm not giving it to them [50:31] and that gives them the motivation to do [50:33] it on their own [50:35] [Music] [50:36] i'll do that and then once the dog is [50:38] reliably [50:39] doing it then i'll do like if i got a [50:41] really fast sit i'll reward that [50:43] or the dog's in the perfect position [50:44] i'll reward that something that's a [50:46] little bit better if you don't ask for [50:47] more the dog's not gonna give you more [50:49] so a lot of people get stuck at luring [50:51] every single time [50:52] because they never ask for more [50:56] and if you if you are helping the dog [50:57] every single time you're doing the work [50:59] for [50:59] the dog versus the dog doing this [51:02] behavior and [51:03] trying to get the reward so and that's [51:05] the difference for me between a reward [51:07] and a bribe [51:08] is a bribe the food comes first and [51:10] reward it comes second [51:12] i like that yeah so it's okay to reward [51:14] the dog it's not okay to bribe [51:16] so luring essentially is bribing we're [51:18] taking the food we're using the food to [51:20] get the behavior but it's contingent [51:21] upon the food being in my hand [51:23] so i want to get rid of that as soon as [51:25] possible and get it to where they're [51:27] doing it [51:28] in the anticipation of receiving a [51:30] reward for doing it correctly [51:31] believe it or not we do not have too [51:33] much time left so i do want to hit up [51:35] some of the questions that i've been [51:36] asked on protection [51:38] uh some of them are very i think they'll [51:41] be [51:41] pretty straightforward and easy to [51:42] answer so one was how do i teach my dog [51:45] to attack and [51:46] all these questions that people ask on [51:48] my channel i always respond to them i [51:50] try to give people the best answer that [51:52] i can [51:52] quickly through a comment so what i told [51:55] them it's you know with anything it's [51:57] about teaching the behavior first [51:59] and what we do in the videos or what you [52:01] do i should say in the french ring [52:02] introduction videos that we do [52:04] is you make it a game you make it fun [52:06] you have the puppies playing with [52:08] i think you're using a flirt pole or [52:10] you're using a rag on a [52:12] rope or something like that so what how [52:15] do you introduce it to them so just like [52:17] you said number one is get the behavior [52:18] so if i'm the [52:22] kind of define your behavior too so if [52:23] attack means go forward and bite [52:25] something [52:25] right we'll just do that for the sake of [52:27] today the number one is to get that [52:29] behavior so if i'm sure that i can get [52:30] my dog to do it sometimes i'll hold them [52:32] back by a call or you know a [52:34] thick collar or their harness and i'll [52:36] hold them hold them back hold them back [52:37] and they're pulling pulling pulling i'll [52:38] say [52:38] yeah i'll say attack and when i say [52:40] attack then i'm going to let them go [52:41] they'll go and bite [52:42] we'll play play play i'll do it again [52:44] i'll throw it out i'll hold him back [52:46] ready ready ready [52:46] attack i let him go they go out and bite [52:48] so i'm sure that the dog is going to [52:50] give me that behavior that i'm [52:51] looking for and then you can just switch [52:54] it to other objects [52:55] you know decoys or whatever and with [52:58] attack i think it's important [53:00] some people you know i don't want people [53:01] to just go out there and start trying to [53:03] teach their dog [53:04] attack you know i mean when we do it for [53:07] the sport [53:07] it's prey drive the dogs enjoy it and [53:11] more often than not the dogs see the [53:14] decoy as just [53:15] a sparring partner yeah and somebody [53:17] wearing their toy [53:19] you know and that's why a lot of these [53:20] sport protection dogs [53:22] you can work with them in a bite suit [53:24] and then take the jacket off and go [53:26] pet them and hang out with them but then [53:28] of course there's other times because [53:29] you work uh [53:30] with a lot of police officers as well [53:31] right or i don't know how many you work [53:32] with but i've worked with a couple with [53:34] you guys [53:35] and the training has to be a little bit [53:37] different for that what are some of the [53:38] big differences when it comes to [53:40] a working dog on the street with maybe a [53:42] police officer or military [53:44] uh working dog in comparison to the [53:46] sport [53:47] so again everything depends on the dog [53:49] so some dogs [53:51] take their work very seriously and some [53:53] of them [53:54] it's just a big game um [53:57] if the dog has the right drives it's [53:59] very easy [54:00] to teach them that you don't have to [54:02] have a suit you can just bite whatever [54:05] as long as the dog has the right [54:06] character if the dog is a little bit [54:08] tentative and they're like oh no i can't [54:09] bite you i don't hurt your feelings then [54:11] it really doesn't have the right drives [54:12] to be a police dog anyways [54:14] police dogs need to be able to pass [54:15] everywhere and bite anything um [54:19] so if if you're switching from um [54:22] like ipo that your igp they do this a [54:24] lot where they'll [54:25] agitate the dog with the sleeve they'll [54:27] put it down they'll go to the side [54:29] and they'll kind of agitate the dogs um [54:32] civilly silly i think that's right i [54:35] always call it putting them in defense [54:36] okay they put them on defense whatever [54:38] they get them on just the man not the [54:40] the suit they agitate the dog actually [54:42] the dog when the dog is showing good [54:43] barking good aggression they'll go back [54:44] grab it and then feed the dog or they'll [54:46] put it behind their back so that way the [54:47] dog is looking at them [54:49] when they get the right behavior they'll [54:50] back up and then they'll come back and [54:51] they'll feed the dog [54:53] there's also like hidden sleeves and [54:54] things like that that you can use to [54:56] transfer the dogs [54:58] probably there's there's fake arms [55:00] there's all kinds of stuff now but [55:02] most most of the time and there's some [55:04] people who you know they want to do that [55:06] and they want to do the you know bonsai [55:08] kind of attack training and stuff [55:10] but once you start getting into that [55:12] stuff it really turns [55:14] for me if you don't know what you're [55:15] doing if you don't have a lot of control [55:17] and a really good group that's cheating [55:20] working with you it turns into a huge [55:21] liability [55:23] yep and that's why i want to mention the [55:25] two going back to the command how do i [55:26] teach my dog to attack [55:28] if i'm to one of my friends call me up [55:30] and let's say they live on the other [55:31] side of the world [55:32] and they say hey i want to teach my dog [55:34] an attack well i'm going to teach them [55:35] how to do it in a way where it's prey [55:38] drive for the dog and it's fun for the [55:39] dog because more often than not when [55:41] somebody does have a dog so a lot of [55:43] times when people are thinking [55:44] protection [55:44] dog what are they thinking the dog [55:46] actually protecting them right [55:48] well more often than not if you have a [55:50] malinois or dutch shepherd or german [55:51] shepherd and these working style dogs [55:54] that's a deterrent usually enough and [55:57] then if you want to teach the dog to [55:59] even be more of a deterrent i always [56:00] recommend just teach the dog to bark yep [56:02] and that brings me to my next question [56:04] because i put a video up last week on [56:05] how to teach your dog to bark and i used [56:08] the frustration techniques not the [56:09] knocking on the wall or holding [56:11] something in my hand waiting for the dog [56:12] to bark [56:12] and that's the beauty about the science [56:14] of dog training it's whatever gets a dog [56:15] to do it get the behavior [56:16] right i always enjoy using the [56:18] frustration putting them on the back [56:20] and doing a form of dry building getting [56:22] them to bark and letting them realize [56:23] the bark [56:24] is what brings the reward to them so [56:26] we're teaching them to bark to get the [56:28] reward [56:28] and a question i had was how do i [56:30] constantly or how do i teach my dog to [56:32] continually bark [56:33] on command so that's just duration and [56:35] it's situation based i think too because [56:37] that's another thing with the search and [56:38] escort [56:39] the dog has to come around find the [56:41] decoy and bark correct [56:42] until so they they only have to bark [56:45] once [56:46] oh really they don't have to like an igp [56:48] they they want that consistent you know [56:50] wow wow [56:51] wow in french thing they could walk and [56:53] go whoa and then just lay down there [56:55] quietly [56:55] but they never do that they don't [56:57] because again they're the dog is saying [56:59] you know move [56:59] move move move move um and it's that [57:03] duration [57:03] if the dog came through and barked twice [57:05] and then the decoy ran and the dog bit [57:07] the next time come back well that didn't [57:09] work why and then the dog left [57:11] the decoy left he goes okay keep you [57:13] know move move move that's what the dog [57:15] is kind of yelling at the decoy like [57:17] move i want that bite [57:18] because we've taught them that when they [57:19] come in the duke is not moving you're [57:21] supposed to be barking [57:22] and so then you're just adding that [57:23] duration so like if we're training it [57:25] initially one bark gets a bite and then [57:28] maybe one bar gets a bite and now i'm [57:30] gonna ask for more and i want two barks [57:32] and then you get a bite [57:33] now i'm gonna wait you know and maybe [57:35] they're quiet like what the heck [57:37] okay now you get it and then you just [57:38] build up that's all it is duration [57:40] you're just keeping that hope alive that [57:42] if you bark you can make this guy move [57:44] um and i like doing the barking in that [57:47] frustration because it does have [57:49] some kind of anger behind it almost [57:52] because the dog's like you know [57:53] give me it go move give me you know so [57:55] it's not just you know chasing something [57:58] or you know the boogeyman it's the dog [58:00] is [58:01] being demanding and forward and more [58:03] powerful because they're [58:05] essentially demanding something with [58:07] their bark it's not like [58:09] so it you you get a lot of heart and a [58:11] lot of you know [58:12] a real bark versus like because they're [58:14] like [58:15] give me it move let me have what i want [58:18] um [58:18] so they i mean they almost when you put [58:20] them in the right situation they almost [58:22] will instinctively bark more and that's [58:23] why [58:24] you know during that routine or that [58:27] exercise rather in the sport [58:28] every dog continues to bark until the [58:30] decoy moves i mean i think every single [58:32] french ring competition i've watched the [58:34] dog continues to bark [58:35] so i think that's a great answer for [58:36] that person's question the other [58:38] question that was asked was [58:40] um the out command [58:43] which the out command is going to be [58:46] different [58:46] to each sport and of course with police [58:49] training [58:50] yeah what are what are some of the [58:51] really big differences when it comes to [58:53] teaching [58:54] a police canine a working police k9 and [58:56] out in comparison to [58:58] french ring i think french ring is [58:59] probably the most extreme [59:01] when it comes to outing i mean i igp [59:04] now they require a fast out um [59:07] they time it like french ring yeah i [59:09] think i don't know the exact rules but i [59:11] know that when [59:12] it has to be a pretty quick out um so [59:16] my kind of thing behind it is if you get [59:18] bit by a police dog like the dog [59:19] does not need to let go right i don't [59:21] want the dog outing and then biting [59:23] upper arm or [59:24] the guy yells hey ow and the dog pops [59:26] off right away right you [59:27] the dog needs to hold on there until the [59:29] handler comes off up [59:30] to the dog and then if the dog takes [59:32] five seconds you know [59:34] ow you know that's actually a pretty [59:37] good out for a police dog [59:38] um they tend to not have an out usually [59:40] have to do a tactical out [59:42] uh i think it's called isn't it called [59:44] the blue fog if they send in [59:47] i think i heard it somewhere i could be [59:48] wrong but they send the dog in the dog [59:50] goes in takes down the bad guy [59:52] they all run in and they don't want the [59:54] dog to well you said let go and start [59:56] chewing because i think [59:56] every single bite there has to be a new [59:59] report on it right [60:00] i don't know how that works i'm not sure [60:01] either but they also don't want the dog [60:03] to let go and invite a police officer [60:05] so by having it so the the approach is [60:07] going to be different because i've seen [60:08] a couple of videos that people have [60:10] posted with a police dog [60:11] biting somebody and then not outing [60:13] right away people like they can't even [60:14] train the dog to out [60:16] yeah it's like well it's situational [60:18] it's a much different thing yeah and [60:19] like you said you also don't want the [60:20] dog to think they're supposed to go [60:22] the biggest thing that in that situation [60:24] for me [60:25] is the handlers need to know how to [60:26] handle their dogs so they need to know [60:29] when it's timed out how for their dog do [60:32] they out does the dog actually have a [60:34] verbal out [60:35] that they can use but it takes five [60:36] seconds or two seconds or whatever does [60:38] that dog have that or [60:39] do you know that your dog is not gonna [60:41] out and you need to be prepared and out [60:43] your dog [60:43] you need to be the one that out the dog [60:45] um and there's break sticks that [60:47] like they used to use for dog fighting [60:48] and essentially you stick it in the back [60:50] of their jaw and you turn and [60:51] pops open their mouth so that way that [60:52] you can actually get the dog to out [60:54] or you know you'll grab the collar and [60:56] twist and when they eventually need air [60:57] they let go of the bite there's there's [60:59] different ways that you can get the dog [61:01] to forcefully to out if they don't do it [61:03] um and i [61:04] i don't know in my opinion they need the [61:07] the police [61:08] canine handlers need to be more aware of [61:12] the ways to manually out your dog [61:14] because when they're all [61:15] you know revved up and the bad guy's [61:17] been kicking them they're like yes this [61:19] is my revenge [61:20] when the dye is finally subdued and [61:22] they're taking that back out on the guy [61:23] so the handlers need to know how [61:25] to manually out their dogs if the dog is [61:27] not going to respond to verbal commands [61:29] because there's no reason that the dog [61:31] should be you know out out and it takes [61:33] them 30 seconds like you can you can out [61:35] a dog manually a lot faster than that if [61:36] they know how yes [61:37] um so i think they the handlers all [61:41] should all know how to [61:42] manually out their dog efficiently um [61:45] and i don't know if they [61:46] train that as much as they probably [61:48] should well with the [61:49] french ring the french ring french ring [61:51] you have to have a super clean out that [61:52] would be very quick yes [61:53] i mean you can lose a lot of points yeah [61:54] i mean by the t on out [61:56] or on the tion alt the dog has to be out [61:59] um so a lot of the times in training at [62:02] least what we do is we teach the dog [62:04] out on their name so if i like john [62:06] luke's dog highlander he does a three [62:08] syllable name so that way it's longer [62:10] and then he's got the out so he's got [62:12] highlander out so he's got four seconds [62:14] from when he starts talking to the t the [62:17] dog essentially has to let go [62:19] if i have a dog named cash for example [62:22] cash out [62:22] cash out there's two seconds much faster [62:24] yeah so again if you know the sport you [62:26] know how it's [62:27] how it's uh scored you can kind of even [62:30] name your puppy appropriately i like a [62:31] two syllable i think three is too long [62:34] um for me just be going you know [62:36] highlander opa [62:37] highlander it's a lot i like a two-sible [62:40] you know grisby [62:41] hammer gunner uh sadie i like [62:44] short it gives you you know if it was [62:47] gunner out [62:48] gun or out i've got three three uh [62:51] syllables by the time the dog can [62:52] let go also how you say so i go gunner [62:55] out i can [62:56] use my gun for the gunner to get the dog [62:59] out [62:59] if i'm going you know hammer out he's [63:01] like screw you you know and he keeps [63:03] doing it so that's where you use your [63:04] voice [63:05] to get the dog um and the way that i say [63:07] it too it's very abrupt when he hears [63:09] his name it's gonna [63:10] have behind it to help the dog know that [63:12] it's time to let go [63:13] and i think that's that is what the [63:14] person was asking they want a very [63:16] quick and responsive out so how do you [63:18] start teaching that [63:20] so a lot of times if you have problems [63:22] outing the decoy you have problems [63:23] outing elsewhere [63:26] so i've never seen one person who has [63:28] problems with just the decoy [63:30] but if they say out on a tug the dog [63:31] poop immediately or you say out on a [63:33] ball they [63:34] out immediately most of the time if it's [63:37] if you have four seconds slowed out on a [63:39] decoy you have at least two on a tug [63:42] i can almost guarantee you if you're [63:43] having problems with outing on a decoy [63:44] you have outing problems other places [63:46] so if you do your homework and you clean [63:48] up where you can [63:50] it does two things you're not um [63:52] creating any [63:53] negative associations with the decoy [63:55] because you're cleaning it up elsewhere [63:57] and then that's going to transfer over [63:59] to your decoy work so [64:00] i always tell people clean up your outs [64:02] you know off off the decoy that can be [64:04] with the dog [64:05] yeah i mean that could be with the dog [64:06] on a you know back tie and you're [64:08] playing with a wedge [64:09] you know and really getting the dog it [64:10] moving and getting the dog out [64:12] a lot of times what people do too is [64:14] they only out [64:15] off of things that aren't moving so [64:17] they'll be playing with the dog and then [64:18] they freeze up they tell the dog to out [64:20] and if the dog is biting a suit and it's [64:24] up here [64:24] it's the decoy a lot of times is still [64:26] moving with each punch [64:28] and so that keeps the game alive so if [64:30] you've never taught the dog to out on a [64:32] moving tug [64:33] good luck getting them to out on a [64:34] moving decoy so there's a lot of stuff [64:36] that you can do to clean up your outs [64:38] away from the decoy because if you have [64:40] super [64:41] crisp outs everywhere else you're more [64:42] likely to have a crisp out on the decoy [64:44] yeah that makes sense what if you do [64:46] have a dog that is really struggling [64:48] with an out like even on a [64:49] tug or ball and maybe value transfer is [64:52] not working are there other certain [64:53] techniques [64:54] you might implement to try to get the [64:55] dog to do it better or faster or [64:57] yeah it just depends on the dog so um [65:01] that's that's the kind of the yeah you [65:03] have to training you know yes it's worth [65:05] your while [65:06] we've done our transfers we've done you [65:08] know giving it back we've done all of [65:09] that stuff and the dog goes no i want to [65:11] keep what i have and that's where you go [65:12] yeah you have to out now you have to do [65:14] some pressure [65:14] something like that yeah i talk about [65:16] that a little bit in my out video if the [65:18] value transfer is not working if you [65:19] can't get the dog to [65:21] trade for something then sometimes [65:23] that's when we do have to use a little [65:24] bit of force [65:25] and then of course once a dog knows then [65:27] they do it willingly yeah [65:29] and a lot of times when i do do the [65:31] force again that's why i want to do it [65:32] away from the decoy [65:33] because if i'm doing the force with the [65:34] decoy now i can have a dog that's more [65:37] nervous on the bite or they're changing [65:39] their grip anticipating the outs or [65:40] they're really vocal [65:42] on their out or they're really vocal on [65:44] their bite on the decoy [65:45] anticipating any kind of conflict with [65:46] the out so a lot of times what i'll do [65:49] if i'm having issues [65:50] with an out is i'll do it where i'm just [65:52] walking with the dog in a toy in their [65:53] mouth and i'll tell them to out it [65:55] there's no tension on it there's no [65:56] nothing if they can't [65:58] drop a toy on their out when i'm just [66:00] walking with them again good luck when [66:01] it's alive [66:02] and then as soon as i out get it you [66:03] know and then i'll let them get it again [66:04] and i'll do that [66:05] and then i can start where i'm actually [66:07] playing with the dog and i ask them to [66:08] out [66:09] again and i'll give it right back to [66:11] them and then i'll do that with the [66:12] decoy [66:12] where as soon as they out boom they get [66:14] that bite right back so i am doing [66:16] even though i'm starting to introduce [66:18] pressure and the yeah i have to's [66:19] i'm also going back to using more [66:21] reinforcement [66:23] than i would if i was just doing my [66:25] transfers [66:26] um so if you need to you can go back a [66:29] step that's [66:29] what i talk about yeah and whenever i [66:31] have any kind of a problem i always go [66:33] back [66:33] you always can go back to your [66:34] foundation which is why it's very [66:36] important to have a good foundation [66:38] and that's the biggest problem that i'm [66:40] having with my shepherd is i didn't get [66:41] him till he was two [66:42] and he was a pet dog before so i did do [66:44] his pet dog obedience [66:45] but if he laid down and flopped on a hip [66:47] i didn't care he's just a pet dog [66:49] and now i'm trying to clean up all of [66:51] that stuff for my retrieves before [66:53] for the last you know for his first two [66:55] years he'd brought the ball back and [66:57] dropped at your feet [66:58] well i need him to i need him to hold [67:00] and sit it now and so now i'm trying to [67:02] undo [67:02] two years of problems to try to get a [67:06] good retrieve [67:07] um so and again this is why it's [67:10] easier if you know from puppyhood that [67:12] this is the sport that you're doing [67:13] these are the rules [67:14] it's a lot easier if i would have taught [67:16] him from eight weeks of age or [67:18] however old he was that this is how [67:20] we're gonna do it because this is what [67:22] our goal is it makes it much easier than [67:23] going oh well for two years [67:25] it's okay that you drop it at my feet [67:27] and now i want you to sit straight and [67:28] hold it until i take it from you [67:30] um you know and instead of just healing [67:31] with a loose leash now i want your neck [67:33] by my leg and your shoulders can't go [67:35] go in front and now your head can't go [67:37] behind so now i'm trying to go back [67:39] and fix all of those things and it's a [67:42] much much easier to teach it right from [67:43] the start [67:44] because they haven't developed all the [67:46] bad habits yeah yeah [67:48] and that's that's another thing going [67:49] back to french ring is [67:51] if you are going to be joining a club [67:54] find your club and let them do your my [67:55] work [67:57] i couldn't agree more yep because then [67:58] they're going to know what's the best [67:59] way for that specific sport whether it's [68:01] for entering money or ring psa [68:03] um last protection question and then [68:06] we'll wrap this up [68:07] so another question that was asked is [68:09] how do i teach my dog [68:11] a alert or bark kind of command but [68:14] to look at what i feel is the threat [68:17] i'm trying to phrase it kind of how i [68:19] did in the question so what i would i'll [68:22] explain how i would do it really quickly [68:23] and see if you add to it or what you [68:24] would do [68:25] first i would just do basically the way [68:27] i taught barking in the video with [68:29] harley [68:29] have her on a back tie teaser with a toy [68:31] she barks i reward her [68:33] then i put it on a command usually if [68:35] i'm having somebody [68:37] that i'm teaching their dog this [68:38] deterrent i have them say easy [68:40] or something like that so it's like easy [68:42] boy it's not get them or something like [68:44] that [68:44] so then i have them say easy so if [68:46] you're the handler i would have you say [68:48] easy then i move and [68:49] and kind of agitate the dog they bark i [68:51] reward them then i start doing it where [68:53] i'm hiding around the corner i have them [68:55] say easy [68:56] then i come around the corner with the [68:57] toy dog barks at me i reward them [68:59] then i have them randomly walk around [69:01] the neighborhood i tell them where i'm [69:02] going to be hiding [69:04] once they get to that location i have [69:05] them say easy i pop out of nowhere [69:07] dog barks at me i reward them so then [69:09] the dog starts to believe [69:10] every time my owner says easy there's [69:13] gonna be something [69:14] this toy is gonna pop out and i'm gonna [69:15] be able to get that toy if i bark at [69:17] them [69:18] so i feel like that's a pretty good way [69:20] to do it where it's a deterrent [69:22] but it's not actually teaching the dog [69:24] to bite out of anger or [69:26] aggression or anything like that it's [69:28] just here's a deterrent [69:30] great now it's not really liability or [69:32] you're gonna have any liability [69:34] issues yeah um i mean that's good if you [69:36] have two people [69:37] if you're by yourself another thing that [69:39] you can do is [69:41] um so if you have the dog that's on a [69:43] back tie [69:44] um you could use like a um [69:48] like a horse lunging whip and then put [69:50] your toy on the end of it [69:51] and then you can have that fishing out [69:53] in front of you and then [69:55] tell the dog to bark and you can kind of [69:56] keep that toy alive the dog barks yes [69:58] and you can let him go forward [69:59] and that way you're next the dog the [70:01] dog's focus is forward [70:03] and then you're rewarding it that way so [70:04] that's something you can do by yourself [70:06] and you can even have the dog on a leash [70:08] throw that out in front you know tell [70:10] the dog watch him or bark or can i help [70:12] you whatever your word is [70:13] the dog you know doesn't bark you can [70:16] frustrate the dog by moving it in front [70:17] of you while you're still next to the [70:18] dog [70:19] that way the dog's attention is here the [70:21] dog barks yes you can let him go forward [70:23] and then you can start to ask for more [70:25] and then you can start to put it where [70:26] the dog the ball is already on the field [70:28] you tell your dog to you know whatever [70:31] your command is the dog goes for it [70:33] get it and then you can transfer to [70:35] people and you can just ask hate your [70:37] neighbor hey put a ball behind your [70:39] back you know the same thing then you [70:40] can even show the dog at first and then [70:41] hide it until the dog assumes that [70:44] anybody that you say to watch it is [70:45] gonna have one um [70:47] and i prefer that because it's a [70:48] friendly way to do it it's nice you're [70:50] not putting the dog in defense you're [70:52] not creating stress [70:53] because i have done it before in the [70:55] past and i forget who it was i was [70:57] talking to [70:58] and they said you know it's i don't like [70:59] doing that because it is putting the dog [71:01] i think it was me [71:02] it might have been yeah and that's the [71:05] way i used to do it was i'd come out and [71:06] i'd act like a bad guy [71:08] and i would get the dog to bark at me [71:10] but they're in the beginning some dogs [71:12] are more nervous they're worried they [71:13] might be looking at you cautious they [71:15] give the smallest little bark and i act [71:16] like their bark is shooting me yeah and [71:18] i go back but yeah i was putting them [71:20] into a different mindset then hey this [71:21] is play this is fun [71:23] and i always think it's better to make [71:24] it play and make it fun [71:26] the other thing too is if you have a dog [71:27] that's super confident they're like [71:30] why would i like yeah he's actually [71:31] weird but he's not a threat like [71:33] they just don't care they're like yeah [71:35] he's really weird but i'm so confident [71:36] myself like there's no reason to bark at [71:38] this guy [71:39] and then you have to start doing it at [71:40] night in different situations but then [71:42] again you're teaching the dog that when [71:43] you are scared [71:45] that you handle being scared with that [71:46] aggression and now you're [71:48] asking the dog to determine who's a [71:49] threat who's not a threat and dogs have [71:51] the brain capacity of a three-year-old [71:53] like i wouldn't trust my three or [71:54] my two-year-old to to choose who's good [71:56] and who's bad like [71:58] i don't trust the dog to make those [71:59] decisions um if something were to [72:01] actually happen that's where genetically [72:03] like either the dog's gonna do it or not [72:05] um but and in my kind of um [72:09] my comparison to this is if somebody [72:10] pulls a gun right you're not going to [72:12] ask [72:12] you know oh is that loaded before you do [72:14] what they say right if somebody pulls a [72:15] gun in you [72:16] and you're like whoa you know you're [72:17] going to back away from me you're going [72:18] to do whatever they say the same as a [72:20] dog that's barking [72:21] they're not like are you barking for [72:22] your toy right they're like oh okay [72:24] there's a big shepherd that's end of his [72:25] leash barking at me [72:26] like i'm probably gonna go find somebody [72:29] else or go to the next house [72:31] you really don't need bullets inside if [72:33] you have a dog that will actually bite [72:35] or if you have a gun that's loaded [72:37] you don't like kids play through your [72:38] gun you have to know where it is all the [72:39] time you have to lock it away when you [72:41] can't watch it [72:42] there's a lot more responsibility that [72:43] comes with that loaded gun or that dog [72:45] that is trained in defense [72:47] or will actually bite some people do [72:50] need [72:50] a loaded gun or a dog that's actually [72:52] going to bite but you can't take it [72:53] everywhere [72:54] as if it is the dog that's just a [72:56] deterrent [72:58] so that's where you have to kind of [72:59] decide do i really need a dog that's [73:00] going to bite and am i prepared [73:02] to build a kennel run put a lock on it [73:04] make sure that i know where that dog is [73:06] all the time that he's always under [73:07] control [73:07] and nobody else can play with it do i [73:09] have a boarding kennel that can handle [73:10] the dog [73:11] if something were to happen to me are [73:12] you prepared for all of those things [73:14] because if something were to happen to [73:16] you you get a car crash on your way home [73:17] you know heaven forbid [73:18] who's gonna take care of that dog right [73:20] so you have to have things in place [73:22] you know your trainer or whoever to make [73:24] sure that that dog is always taken care [73:26] of if for some reason you die [73:27] where's this dog going because if it's [73:29] just a deterrent it's not a big deal [73:31] if it's a dog that will actually bite [73:32] you have to be very careful there's a [73:34] lot more that goes into that [73:35] and that's a great way to close this [73:36] podcast this is something i like to say [73:38] in every protection video [73:40] if someone's going to do protection [73:41] training contact a local professional or [73:44] sign up at a protection club that trains [73:47] for a specific sport [73:48] so you're working with a bunch of [73:49] experts that can help you guys [73:51] to make sure you don't make any of the [73:53] mistakes that could cause problems down [73:55] the road [73:55] yeah do you have any saved rounds um [74:01] no

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 44/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everybody welcome back in today's [00:02] episode [00:03] i'm here at phd canines with a [00:05] professional dog trainer bethany [00:07] and we're going to be doing some puppy [00:08] fundamental training for the sport of [00:10] friendship [00:11] she's going to break down exactly what [00:13] we're going to be doing in this video [00:14] and then we're going to jump [00:16] hi my name is bethany today we're going [00:18] to do some puppy foundation [00:20] training for french ring sport i'm going [00:22] to go over my equipment first and then [00:23] i'll bring out my puppy [00:25] so i have a rubber black [00:28] feed tub you can get them from tractor [00:30] supply or most local feed stores [00:32] i use this for puppy object guard [00:35] training and i also flip it over for [00:37] touch pads for my jumps and to teach [00:40] targeting [00:41] so i've got that ready i've got a muzzle [00:44] for [00:44] the um heal with muzzle i take off the [00:47] straps and that way it's easier for the [00:48] dog to stick their head in for the treat [00:50] so i've got that [00:52] i've got my flexi lead or my retractable [00:54] line i use this for recalls [00:56] if i want my dog to have a little bit of [00:57] freedom but still be able to stop them [01:00] and then i've got my short one meter [01:02] leash that i'm going to need for my [01:04] heel on leash for french ring and then [01:06] i've just got a regular [01:08] longer leash so i can step on it if my [01:09] puppy decides that they find something [01:11] more fun than me [01:13] then i also have my whistle that i'll be [01:14] using for my retrieves this is optional [01:16] you can use a verbal recall [01:18] but i find it's more clear to use a [01:19] whistle in french ring [01:21] i've got my socks for my retrieve they [01:24] need to be about the size of a fist and [01:26] equal and then i've got some [01:29] small high value soft food this is [01:32] actually a raw diet [01:34] or freeze-dried raw that way if my puppy [01:36] eats a whole lot of treats they're not [01:37] going to get an upset stomach [01:39] so now that i have all of this i'll get [01:40] my puppy and we're ready to go all right [01:42] so this is my puppy [01:44] he is a around four-month-old belgian [01:46] traverin [01:47] which is the long-haired brown variety [01:49] of the belgian shepherd [01:51] we imported both of his parents from [01:52] france and he was actually born and [01:54] raised here [01:56] so i'm going to go over just some of the [01:57] basic stuff that i do with puppies [02:00] the first thing that i do is reward [02:01] attention so [02:03] yes [02:06] with puppies i don't use a clicker too [02:08] often just because i like to have my [02:09] hands [02:10] free so the first portion of this video [02:13] i'm going to be adding commentary if [02:15] you'd like to see bethany training [02:17] without the additional commentary then [02:19] jump to this portion [02:20] of the video if you notice in the very [02:23] beginning i love the fact that she [02:24] starts with engagement training it's [02:26] something that i often talk about [02:28] when i'm working with a dog at the very [02:30] beginning i want to get my dog or the [02:31] dog [02:32] i'm training to become conditioned to [02:34] the conditioned reinforcers this is [02:36] going to be our markers or our clickers [02:38] once they're conditioned to that sound [02:40] we can use it in the training to help us [02:42] with our timing [02:43] however in the beginning of every [02:45] session i like to start just how bethany [02:48] is right here [02:49] doing engagement training i like to do [02:51] anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds [02:53] to really get the puppy or the dog into [02:55] the right mindset so they're going to [02:57] learn [02:58] more effectively within that training [03:02] session [03:04] yes [03:11] yes that was an excellent example of [03:14] bethany waiting for the puppy to [03:16] re-engage with her [03:17] she wasn't asking for the puppy to do it [03:19] she was waiting till the puppy did the [03:20] correct behavior [03:21] then she marked and gave the puppy a [03:23] reward this is going to show the puppy [03:25] that other things in the environment [03:27] simply are not as interesting or as fun [03:30] as it is when the puppy is staying [03:31] engaged with bethany [03:35] yes [03:38] yes once i have attention i'm gonna go [03:40] into some healing i'm gonna do it on the [03:42] right and the left just that way if i [03:43] need to use it for the escort later i [03:45] can also [03:50] notice during this portion of the [03:51] training bethany is not giving the puppy [03:53] a bunch of commands [03:54] she wants to make sure she can get the [03:56] puppy to do the behavior the exact way [03:58] she would like the puppy to [04:00] while doing luring or even guiding the [04:03] puppy [04:04] with the leash in her body language but [04:06] this helps show the puppy what we want [04:08] without overstimulating the puppy by [04:10] giving a bunch of commands before they [04:12] even know what's expected of them [04:14] so she does an excellent job luring the [04:16] puppy into the different positions she [04:18] wants the puppy to perform [04:19] and then marking and rewarding at the [04:21] correct time creating [04:23] a desire for the puppy to start seeking [04:25] out these positions [04:27] on their own [04:41] right here while the puppy's in perfect [04:43] heel position she's reinforcing the [04:45] puppy maintaining this position [04:46] by giving the puppy multiple rewards [04:49] while staying [04:50] in the perfect heel [05:23] this is an excellent exercise where [05:25] she's having the puppy go [05:26] from the left heel position into the [05:28] right heel position her body language is [05:30] making it very clear and very easy [05:32] for the puppy to find the right position [05:34] and when they start to understand [05:37] these heel positions while doing [05:39] training [05:40] they don't have to do that circle that [05:42] she's having the puppy do [05:43] that's in the beginning when we're [05:44] shaping the behavior we want them to [05:46] perform [05:47] but once they know how to get into that [05:49] position then they will do what's known [05:51] as a flip finish they will swing their [05:53] back and around [05:54] right into that perfect heel position [06:11] wait wait [06:21] if you notice she had the puppy do a [06:23] little spin right there that's something [06:24] i like to do as well [06:25] and it's very important to make sure [06:27] they enjoy the heel position so the more [06:29] fun we can make it [06:30] the better it's going to be because this [06:32] is an exercise that is required [06:34] in most competition dog training [06:36] obedience [06:41] and now this is going to be some of the [06:44] initial [06:45] working on the front position and it's [06:46] also going to be used for the escort [06:51] this is an exercise that i like to call [06:53] the backwards follow exercise [06:55] we walk backwards notice bethany's hands [06:57] are up against her body that's going to [06:59] help [06:59] ensure the puppy is nice and close to [07:01] her when she's doing this [07:03] these little details matter quite a bit [07:05] when you're doing competition obedience [07:07] because that's how they're able to [07:08] separate the good dogs from the great [07:10] dogs is by making it a very [07:12] detailed sport [07:30] now this looks a lot like the center [07:32] command but what she's doing as she [07:33] already mentioned right before doing [07:35] this exercise [07:36] is that it's helping shape the behavior [07:38] for the search and escrow routine [07:40] in the french ring competition obedience [07:42] this is where the dog has to find the [07:43] decoy [07:44] and then escort the decoy until the [07:46] decoy tries to run away [07:47] so by having the puppy learn this [07:49] position it makes it much [07:51] easier for the puppy to stay or the dog [07:53] when they grow up [07:54] to stay nice and close to the decoy and [07:56] follow them until the decoy attempts to [07:59] escape [07:59] which will minimize the amount of meters [08:02] the decoy is able to get [08:03] on the dog which in the end results in [08:06] less points [08:07] being lost during the exercise [08:24] so [08:38] so [08:52] so [08:56] good all right so now we'll do some [09:00] touch pad stuff [09:02] again this is going to be used for my [09:03] jump placement and then also for the [09:05] object guard later [09:08] you can see once she set down the place [09:10] bowl the puppy immediately put his paws [09:12] on the bowl his front paws this is [09:14] showing us that she's [09:16] done an excellent job teaching it to the [09:18] puppy but not only has she effectively [09:20] trained the puppy how to do this [09:21] exercise [09:22] but she's made sure that she has created [09:25] a very [09:26] fun and engaging learning experience the [09:29] more [09:29] our puppies or our dogs enjoy the [09:32] training [09:32] the faster they're going to learn this [09:34] is an exercise i like to do as well i [09:36] use it for teaching rear end awareness [09:38] we also use it for teaching [09:40] the flip finish it helps teach the dog [09:42] to spin that back in nicely into the [09:44] heel position [09:45] but just as bethany says it also helps [09:47] with teaching them a specific location [09:49] you want them to go to [09:50] such as the jumps the dog will have to [09:52] perform when he gets older [10:01] this is also good rear end awareness [10:30] all right so this is gonna be for my [10:32] muzzle retrieves [10:34] i'm just gonna stick my treats inside of [10:37] my muzzle [10:45] hey [11:04] and so if you're noticing his attention [11:06] is starting to wane [11:08] so that's super normal puppy so now i'm [11:10] going to try to do something fun i'm [11:11] going to switch it up [11:12] from using food to more games with him [11:15] so i'm gonna do my retrieve [11:18] so i'm gonna use my retractable leash [11:20] for this that way he can't take off with [11:22] his toy if he decides to not come back [11:25] i like that she's using a retractable [11:27] leash for this exercise [11:29] it makes it easier than having a long [11:31] line a long line is [11:32] also a great option but what's nice [11:34] about the flexi lead is [11:36] you don't have to worry about it getting [11:37] tangled up because it retracts [11:40] on its own so this is an excellent tool [11:43] to use for things like your recall or [11:45] your trees [11:46] or different things where you need a [11:47] long line but you also don't want to [11:49] deal with [11:50] reeling in that long line each time the [11:52] flexi leash can do that for you [11:56] you always want to try to think one step [11:57] ahead of your puppy [11:59] they're still a baby don't trust them so [12:02] i've got my object [12:05] i'm just going to draw make some [12:06] attention to it toss it close [12:09] good boy [12:13] good boy ready ready ready [12:19] good boy yay puppy [12:24] that's good boy good boy [12:38] good boy good [12:42] then i always want to leave him wanting [12:43] more so that's all he's going to get for [12:44] that [12:46] then we'll do a couple whistle recalls [12:48] and then we'll call that a day [12:52] notice when she's doing this exercise [12:54] she waits until the puppy is kind of off [12:56] doing his own thing [12:57] then she does the whistle blast that's [12:59] the command [13:00] right after the whistle blast she helps [13:02] the puppy by using the flexi lead [13:04] and then praises the puppy all the way [13:06] back and rewarding the puppy [13:08] once he gets to her making this an [13:10] excellent [13:11] fun learning experience [13:21] way good puppy good [13:26] good [13:30] also practicing a few additional [13:32] positions [13:52] technical difficulties [13:57] ready go [14:14] hey [14:28] so [14:46] good job buddy good [14:57] way good boy [15:02] and that's it for him let's go [15:07] all right so this is rocco rocco is also [15:09] a belgian trevuren he was also born and [15:11] raised with us [15:14] he doesn't have as much drive as his [15:16] brother he's a little bit more of a [15:17] thinker [15:19] so the first thing i always want to do [15:20] whenever i bring a new puppy to club or [15:22] if there's a bunch of new people [15:24] is i want to make sure that my puppy is [15:25] confident and social in the new [15:26] environment [15:27] so i'm just going to bring them over and [15:28] let them come say hi to everybody [15:32] i don't care about manners if he wants [15:33] to jump up on people if he wants to bite [15:35] him i don't care [15:38] i just want to make sure that my puppy [15:39] is friendly [15:41] or at least not scared of everything [15:43] good so he checked everybody out [15:45] reengaged with me [15:47] i can reward him [15:51] he's more of a biter than his brother [15:55] his brother works pretty good for food [15:57] and toys this guy works more for toys [16:02] even though he'd rather have tugs i want [16:04] him to be able to work for food [16:06] they're in more of a thinking state when [16:08] you're using food so [16:10] i'm just going to make sure that when i [16:11] train him that he's nice and hungry [16:13] a common question that is often asked is [16:16] how do i train a puppy that doesn't have [16:17] as much food motivation [16:18] an easy way to do that is wait till the [16:20] puppy's hungry or the dog is hungry [16:22] if you bring your dog out to train and [16:24] your dog is not showing any interest in [16:26] the food [16:27] no problem put the food away [16:30] try again later just make sure you don't [16:32] feed them in between the training [16:33] session [16:34] you want to make sure they're hungry [16:35] enough and motivated enough [16:37] to be willing to work for that reward [16:39] remember reward based training is [16:41] limited on how much the dog wants the [16:44] reward we are offering in order to get [16:46] them to do the behavior [16:48] so i'm just going to do some coming into [16:49] heel positions on the right [16:51] reward them in the sit and the left [16:56] reward them in the set [16:59] i can do my fronts [17:05] and then we'll do some positions this is [17:08] a level one exercise [17:22] and if you notice when i'm doing these [17:23] i'm pushing back into the dog [17:25] in french ring you get points off if the [17:27] dog moves forward so it's important that [17:29] you practice either with [17:31] a board in front of the dog or up on an [17:32] elevated surface or if you're doing them [17:34] by hand that you're pushing back into [17:36] the dog [17:37] so for my stand i'm not pulling forward [17:39] i'm gonna get the dog to pop [17:40] its butt back i know buddy [17:45] so if you watch again for my down [17:46] pushing back [17:51] for my set pushing back [18:00] good stand pushing back [18:03] good and then just to work on [18:06] coordination i'll do some walking [18:12] backwards [18:17] push back into him i know puppy [18:26] yes [18:30] this is going to be used for the [18:31] defensive handler exercise the dog has [18:33] to be [18:34] comfortable walking backwards if he's [18:37] not going in a straight line i can also [18:38] lure him between my legs [18:46] and then push them back this way [18:54] and that way my legs are being used as [18:55] kind of a guide [19:01] notice right here when the puppy comes [19:03] running over to everybody on the [19:04] sidelines [19:05] we ignore the puppy and this is because [19:07] bethany is in the middle of training [19:09] we don't want to show the puppy that [19:11] it's fun [19:12] if he comes over to us when he's [19:14] supposed to be training with bethany [19:16] so by ignoring the puppy it's showing [19:19] him [19:19] hey we're not that interesting or [19:21] exciting but if you go back to bethany [19:24] you're going to see it's way more fun [19:26] when you're with her [19:27] and that's something that's important [19:28] when somebody's working with their dog [19:30] you don't want to start praising them [19:32] and rewarding them [19:33] if they come to you while the person is [19:35] in the middle of a training session [19:37] rocco [19:42] good puppy perfect praise when the puppy [19:44] came back to her [19:48] so he's not as motivated as i want so [19:49] i'm going to end my lesson [19:51] i'm not gonna try to get him to work for [19:52] something that he doesn't want i can try [19:54] switching to using a retrieve and see if [19:56] i can get him to [19:57] play that way [20:05] so see how he's independent so that's [20:07] where i can use my leash come on [20:09] good puppy come here [20:12] good so i'm just gonna reel him in i'm [20:15] gonna pet him so that way he doesn't [20:16] think i'm gonna take it away right away [20:19] good boy he drops it ready ready ready [20:22] get my leash ready ready ready okay [20:29] use my leash to stop him real man good [20:30] boy come on [20:32] good boy good boy [20:36] good job ready [20:39] ready ready ready ready ready [20:44] good boy come on again use my leash to [20:46] stop him [20:47] reel them in good boy good boy [21:01] go boy come on good boy [21:05] so as long as he's coming into my [21:07] direction my leash is loose and it's [21:09] retracting [21:10] if he goes off off the course then i'm [21:12] gonna stop him with my leash [21:14] and help guide him in go boy come on [21:17] that was perfect good job buddy good boy [21:20] ready [21:25] good boy come on nice job buddy [21:29] good boy yeah good boy [21:33] yeah good boy [21:37] good boy good boy [21:56] good boy good boy there you go [21:59] good boy boy [22:04] ready ready ready ready [22:13] so flex the lead malfunction there we go [22:17] come on reel them in [22:20] reel them in good boy [22:23] the reason why i like to sit down to do [22:25] these retrieves is it [22:26] it makes it i'm sure that i'm not gonna [22:28] be chasing him [22:29] so if i'm standing up it's very easy for [22:31] me to kind of reach for him when i'm [22:32] sitting down it's very clear where i [22:34] want him to be [22:38] ready [22:47] good boy good boy [22:52] good and then that's going to be it for [22:55] him [22:56] again i always want to leave the dog [22:57] wanting more [23:00] okay let's go what an excellent session [23:03] with bethany and her two puppies that [23:04] she was working [23:05] what's really interesting is both of [23:07] these puppies come from the same litter [23:08] but you can see there are definite [23:10] differences [23:11] with each one notice at the very [23:12] beginning she starts with that [23:14] engagement training she wants to get the [23:15] puppy focused on her [23:17] then when she was doing all the [23:18] different exercises she didn't have a [23:19] command for everyone [23:20] i talk about this often we first want to [23:22] make sure we can get our puppies [23:24] to do the behavior before we place a [23:26] name on it and also [23:27] everything that she did was very clear [23:30] nothing seemed confusing [23:31] the puppies were never confused they [23:33] knew what was happening and it was very [23:34] fun and exciting for him [23:36] what may have looked like the center [23:37] command if you've seen some of my other [23:39] videos [23:40] she was shaping up behavior for what's [23:42] known as the escort in our french ring [23:44] training [23:45] and our french ring exercise for [23:47] protection training is it called escort [23:49] or search and escort [23:50] well it's it's a certain escort but that [23:52] part is the escort [23:53] so it's called search and escort that's [23:55] the escort part and in this exercise the [23:57] decoys job is to take away as many [23:59] meters as possible from the dog [24:01] meaning that the dog's not paying [24:02] attention and the decoy takes off [24:04] if the dog loses three meters then [24:06] that's going to lose points for the dog [24:08] in the actual obedience or training [24:11] routine for [24:12] the competition so by teaching the puppy [24:14] to maintain that position [24:15] it's going to be easier as the puppy [24:17] gets older to do that exercise in the [24:19] escort [24:20] so what an excellent session i hope you [24:22] guys enjoyed today's video [24:23] please let me know what you think about [24:24] it in the comments below and as always [24:26] like subscribe hit that notification [24:28] bell i'm going to have links in the [24:30] bottom [24:30] to all their different social media [24:32] website and everything so you want to [24:34] learn more from bethany and her team [24:36] check out those links thanks again for [24:38] watching [24:41] all right so this is my puppy he is a [24:44] around four-month-old belgian treviren [24:47] which is the long-haired brown variety [24:49] of the belgian shepherd [24:50] we imported both of his parents from [24:52] france and he was actually born and [24:53] raised here [24:55] so i'm going to go over just some of the [24:57] basic stuff that i do with puppies [24:59] the first thing that i do is reward [25:00] attention so [25:03] yes [25:06] with puppies i don't use a clicker too [25:07] often just because i like to have my [25:09] hands [25:10] free [25:13] yes [25:20] yes [25:26] yes [25:28] yes once i have attention i'm gonna go [25:30] into some healing and i'm gonna do it on [25:31] the right and the left just that way if [25:33] i need to use it for the escort later i [25:34] can also [26:22] so [26:36] uh [26:51] and now this is going to be some of the [26:53] initial [26:54] working on the front position and it's [26:56] also going to be used for the escort [27:18] so [27:32] so [27:46] so [28:04] good all right so now we'll do some [28:08] touch pad [28:09] stuff again this is going to be used for [28:11] my [28:12] jump placement and then also for the [28:13] object guard later [28:23] this is also good rear end awareness [28:53] all right so this is gonna be for my [28:55] muzzle retrieves [28:56] i'm just going to stick my treats inside [28:59] of my muzzle [29:10] hey [29:27] and so if you're noticing his attention [29:29] is starting to wane [29:30] so that's super normal puppy so now i'm [29:32] going to try to do something fun i'm [29:33] going to switch it up [29:34] from using food to more games with him [29:38] so i'm going to do my retrieve [29:41] so i'm going to use my retractable leash [29:43] for this that way he can't take off with [29:45] his toy if he decides to not come back [29:50] you always want to try to think one step [29:51] ahead of your puppy [29:53] they're still a baby don't trust them so [29:56] i've got my object [29:58] ready i'm just going to draw make some [30:00] attention to it toss it close [30:03] good boy come on go puppy [30:08] good boy ready ready ready [30:14] good boy yay puppy [30:18] that's good boy good boy [30:23] [Music] [30:33] good boy good [30:37] that i always want to leave him wanting [30:38] more so that's all he's going to get for [30:39] that [30:40] then we'll do a couple whistle recalls [30:43] and then we'll call that a day [30:54] way good puppy good [31:02] good [31:16] good [31:25] technical difficulties [31:29] ready go [31:44] way [32:19] good job buddy good boy [32:29] way good boy [32:35] and that's it for him let's go all right [32:38] so this is [32:39] rocco rocco is also a belgian trevuren [32:41] he was also born and raised with us [32:45] he doesn't have as much drive as his [32:47] brother he's a little bit more of a [32:48] thinker [32:50] so the first thing i always want to do [32:51] whenever i bring a new puppy to club or [32:53] if there's a bunch of new people [32:54] is i want to make sure that my puppy is [32:56] confident and social in the new [32:57] environment [32:58] so i'm just going to bring him over and [32:59] let him come say hi to everybody [33:03] i don't care about manners if he wants [33:04] to jump up on people if he wants to bite [33:06] him i don't care [33:09] i just want to make sure that my puppy [33:10] is friendly [33:12] or at least not scared of everything [33:14] good so he checked everybody out [33:16] re-engaged with me [33:18] i can reward him [33:22] he's more of a biter than his brother [33:26] his brother works pretty good for food [33:28] and toys this guy works more for toys [33:33] even though he'd rather have tugs i want [33:34] him to be able to work for food [33:37] they're in more of a thinking state when [33:39] you're using food so [33:41] i'm just gonna make sure that when i [33:42] train him that he's nice and hungry [33:45] so i'm just gonna do some coming into [33:47] heel positions on the right [33:48] reward them in the sit the left [33:53] reward them in the set [33:57] i can do my fronts [34:03] and then we'll do some positions this is [34:05] a level one exercise [34:20] and if you notice when i'm doing these [34:21] i'm pushing back into the dog [34:23] in french ring you get points off if the [34:24] dog moves forward so it's important that [34:26] you practice either with [34:28] a board in front of the dog or up on an [34:30] elevated surface or if you're doing them [34:32] by hand that you're pushing back into [34:34] the dog so for my stand i'm not pulling [34:36] forward [34:37] i'm gonna get the dog to pop its butt [34:38] back i know buddy [34:43] so if you watch again from my down [34:44] pushing back [34:48] for my set pushing back [34:57] good stand pushing back [35:01] good and then just to work on [35:03] coordination i'll do some walking [35:05] backwards [35:15] i'm gonna push back into him i know [35:18] puppy [35:19] yes [35:28] this is gonna be used for the defensive [35:29] handler exercise the dog has to be [35:31] comfortable walking backwards if he's [35:34] not going in a straight line i can also [35:36] lure him between my legs [35:44] and then push them back this way [35:52] and that way my legs are being used as [35:53] kind of a guide [35:59] rocco [36:04] go puppy [36:10] so he's not as motivated as i want so [36:11] i'm going to end my lesson [36:13] i'm not going to try to get him to work [36:14] for something that he doesn't want i can [36:16] try switching to using a retrieve and [36:18] see if i can get him to [36:19] play that way ready [36:27] so see how he's independent so that's [36:29] where i can use my leash come on [36:31] come on good puppy come here [36:34] good so i'm just gonna reel him in i'm [36:37] gonna pet him so that way he doesn't [36:38] think i'm going to take it away right [36:39] away [36:40] good boy he drops it ready ready ready [36:44] get my leash ready ready [36:51] use my leash to stop him real man good [36:52] boy on [36:54] good boy good boy [36:58] good job [37:01] ready ready ready ready ready ready [37:06] good boy come on again use my leash to [37:08] stop him [37:09] reel him in good boy good boy [37:23] go boy come on good boy [37:27] so as long as he's coming into my [37:29] direction my leash is loose and it's [37:30] retracting [37:32] if he goes off off the course then i'm [37:34] gonna stop him with my leash [37:36] and help guide him in go boy come on [37:39] that was perfect good job buddy good boy [37:42] ready [37:47] good boy come on nice job buddy [37:51] good boy yeah good boy [37:55] yeah good boy [37:59] good boy good boy [38:04] that's a good puppy ready ready [38:07] ready ready ready [38:18] good boy good boy there you go [38:21] good boy boy [38:26] ready ready ready ready [38:35] so flex the lead malfunction there we go [38:38] come on reel them in [38:42] reel them in good boy [38:45] the reason why i like to sit down to do [38:47] these retrieves is that [38:48] it makes it i'm sure that i'm not gonna [38:50] be chasing him [38:51] so if i'm standing up it's very

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 48/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode in today's video [00:03] we're going to be doing some puppy [00:05] biting for the protection sport known as [00:07] french ring [00:08] bethany perdom from phd canines and ph [00:11] dogs is going to be explaining what's [00:13] going to be taking place [00:14] in this video so get ready for an [00:16] excellent time [00:17] all right so today we've got four month [00:19] old ruguru dupulu [00:21] um he was also born and born here [00:24] we bred him um and now he lives with [00:27] sarah [00:28] who is his trainer um so i'm gonna go [00:31] over [00:31] some of the things that we use for puppy [00:33] foundation bite work [00:34] so i like a really soft like sheepskin [00:38] so that way it's really easy for the [00:39] dogs to grip into and play [00:41] um this guy has a little bit of a bungee [00:42] to it so it's not too harsh on their [00:44] mouth [00:44] if i'm kind of pulling it away like a [00:45] rabbit it also has a little handle so i [00:48] can attach it to a whip to really get it [00:49] going [00:50] so usually with young puppies i'll start [00:52] with something like this [00:55] and then i've got different surfaces [00:56] here so if you notice i have three [00:58] different things i've got this soft [00:59] like fake sheepskin material i've got [01:02] the french ring [01:04] linen and then i also have jute so i [01:06] want the puppies comfortable and [01:07] confident biting on different surfaces [01:09] if they get too used to biting on only [01:11] one thing [01:12] you can create dogs that have a [01:14] preference in their biting and you don't [01:15] want that [01:16] or if you're only doing ipo and it's [01:18] only going to mend you it's not a big [01:19] igp it's not a big deal if you're only [01:21] doing french ring [01:22] it's not a big deal if they only like [01:24] the linen but i like the dogs to be [01:26] comfortable biting whatever [01:27] that way if you decide to switch sports [01:29] later it's not a big deal [01:31] so i've got my little puppy [01:34] lamb thing i've got a soft big [01:37] tug some people will put it over their [01:40] shoe and use [01:41] to feed the dog like that i use it to [01:43] just kind of whip around and get a bite [01:44] that way [01:45] i've got my soft puppy sleeves a lot of [01:48] times i'll actually throw these on my [01:50] arms [01:50] and give the dog's bites low so that way [01:52] they can bite up here [01:54] but these i think are technically leg [01:56] sleeves [01:57] and then i've got my jute puppy sleeves [01:59] they're really soft it's really easy for [02:01] the dogs to bite into them [02:03] and they're also really easy to take on [02:04] and off that's super important when [02:06] you're dealing with puppies when you [02:07] want them to win [02:08] i don't want to give them a reward when [02:10] they're pulling back i want to reward [02:11] them when they've got a nice calm bite [02:14] and then for french ring i've got my [02:15] clatter stick [02:17] with puppies i don't do a lot of contact [02:19] with them i just do a lot of [02:20] desensitizing to the sound [02:23] and the visual of it and [02:26] you can see he's ready to go so we'll [02:27] get started so i'll just kind of he's [02:29] passed this toy [02:30] but just to kind of show you how i play [02:32] with it we'll start with this [02:34] so the first thing that i want to do is [02:35] just kind of wake up the puppy so lots [02:36] of movement get him super excited [02:38] ready i can kind of whip it back and [02:41] forth make it dead [02:43] bring it back to life good i can kind of [02:46] chase him with it [02:48] make it a game and then when i do give [02:50] it to him i want to make sure i have a [02:51] nice clear presentation [02:54] good i'm going to let him re-bite [02:58] good and then back and forth movement if [03:01] you notice sarah isn't moving [03:03] she's acting like a tree or a post good [03:06] i can turn my body away add a little bit [03:09] of frontal pressure [03:10] the dog rebites turn away and then when [03:13] i [03:14] feel like he's doing really good he can [03:16] win [03:18] so sarah's job is to not let him get [03:20] down and start chewing [03:22] her job is to keep him on the same spot [03:25] if he loses and he drops it on his own [03:27] she's not gonna let him get it she's [03:28] gonna kick it back i'm gonna steal it [03:30] and build some frustration [03:37] you can see he's trying to possess it [03:39] with his feet good boy [03:41] so if he's doing really good she can [03:42] also let him back down and let him [03:43] regrip [03:45] and let him learn that if you really [03:46] want it you can keep it [03:54] good it's a little bit of tension let [03:57] him have it [03:58] and now once he lets it go i'm going to [04:00] run away and then we'll switch to [04:00] different [04:02] and this is just patience we don't want [04:05] to be lifting his back feet off the [04:06] ground we're just waiting for him to let [04:07] go [04:11] you notice as soon as he lets it go [04:13] sarah puts him back on the ground [04:17] same thing wake him up run around be [04:19] exciting [04:22] so if you see his style see how he's [04:24] hunting good [04:27] clear presentation good he gets it let [04:29] him re-grip [04:32] way turn my body away from him square up [04:36] re-grips take off the pressure [04:41] good getting used to some touching [04:45] good boy i can pet his feet make sure [04:47] he's comfortable with that [04:49] good switch good [04:55] i can also sit down with him just make [04:57] sure that he's comfortable crossing over [04:58] me [05:00] good boy and then again let him win [05:12] so for this next bite we're going to [05:13] switch to the puppy sleeve [05:21] so some puppies like the chase more than [05:23] the possession [05:24] if you look at him he's very content [05:26] just holding it so some puppies i can [05:28] make this exciting [05:29] and he'll drop what he has to play with [05:31] me but you can see he doesn't care [05:34] so with him we just wait for him to let [05:35] it go when he drops it [05:37] sarah's going to kick it away and i'm [05:38] going to get him refocused on this toy [05:43] but this time i'm going to have her drag [05:44] him in which means she's going to slowly [05:46] let him pull in [05:48] way once he bites she turns into a post [05:51] again [05:52] re-bite good turn my body away [05:55] square up re-bites god [06:00] so now i'm just getting him used to the [06:01] sound of the stick [06:03] a little bit of pressure turn it off a [06:05] little bit of pressure turn it off [06:07] i can also pet the dog with it he wins [06:09] pet the dog with it he wins [06:16] now sarah should be praising him a [06:18] little bit more when he's in the fight [06:20] good boy yeah i get it get him [06:22] he's pretty cold which means he's not [06:24] super animated [06:26] so she can bring some more animation but [06:29] that's just his genetics his dad is the [06:30] same way [06:33] so now we're going to do the other leg [06:34] it's super important that it's always [06:37] right left right left [06:38] if you do too many on one side they will [06:40] have a preference or they're not [06:41] comfortable turning their head [06:43] it's ready i'm going to let them drag in [06:48] good so he lost it i make frustration [06:51] and she's gonna do it again [06:56] that time he bites regrip good [07:02] good good [07:05] if i have a dog that has kind of a [07:06] munchie bite i can also cradle him [07:08] he's fine but i want him comfortable [07:11] being covered [07:14] good [07:16] and then i'm just doing little grip [07:17] checks pulling it if he loses it [07:21] i run away [07:24] so now we're gonna change the surface [07:25] one more time and i'm gonna do it on my [07:28] leg [07:35] so depending on the dog sometimes i'll [07:37] end the lesson [07:38] with frustration and sometimes i'll let [07:41] them win [07:41] depending on what the dog needs so based [07:44] on his temperament [07:46] and being pretty cold he doesn't really [07:48] get too frustrated [07:49] so for him i'm gonna let him possess [07:51] because that's what he really enjoys [07:56] again i'm going to build that attention [08:00] show which leg i want [08:03] and then she's going to drag him in [08:11] give him more lesion good way [08:15] so he's getting kind of tired i can tell [08:17] that his grip is changing [08:19] so i'm going to just take it off of me [08:23] let him kind of cradle it good [08:26] and then she's gonna run to the car with [08:27] him if he drops it [08:29] he's not gonna let him repick it he [08:31] loses okay go [08:42] so even though ideally i would do one [08:44] more bite on the other leg [08:46] i would rather have it be uneven and on [08:49] a good note [08:50] than to push him where he's tired his [08:52] grip might start getting a little bit [08:53] loose [08:54] not as hard um so even if you have the [08:57] idea of doing something [08:58] the dog is the one that always kind of [09:00] determines where the lesson goes [09:02] all right so here we have rocco duploo [09:05] this puppy is a very different lines [09:08] very different genetics than the [09:09] previous puppy [09:10] and you'll notice a big difference [09:11] between the two puppies and also how i [09:13] work the pipies [09:29] way good poppy good [09:34] attic [09:37] [Music] [09:48] ah [09:54] way good boy [10:23] [Music] [10:33] way good papi way [10:56] did you bring back the other one [11:07] so this puppy i want you to watch the [11:09] leash on the harness [11:11] and watch how jean-luc handles the leash [11:22] good way [11:25] attack way [11:31] good boy [11:54] uh [12:08] so [12:22] huh [12:50] free [12:53] [Music] [13:00] way good voila [13:15] ready ready ready [13:18] attack good [13:21] good puppy good and he can win [13:25] and go back [13:28] all right so this puppy is also four [13:30] months old [13:32] he doesn't quite have a name yet i'm [13:33] really embarrassed but we've been [13:35] calling him hairball jr [13:36] um he's a brother to the last dog that [13:38] came out with the red collar on [13:41] so we'll get started with him [13:57] way good boy good boy [14:28] way [14:43] wait hold on just hold him see if i can [14:45] get him to let him go [14:46] just short [15:03] voila puppy [15:24] way [15:38] way [15:52] oh [16:34] all right so the three different puppies [16:35] that we saw two of them are brothers [16:37] last two [16:38] are littermates the first one is [16:40] actually six days younger from a [16:41] different litter than the other two [16:43] um but the one puppy and the two puppies [16:46] are totally different lines [16:48] so if you watch their bite style they're [16:49] very very different so the first puppy [16:52] you when you saw him with the bite work [16:54] he was almost hunting right [16:55] he kind of got still and just watching [16:57] it go by where the last puppy was [16:59] pulling and barking and kind of going [17:00] crazy [17:01] so just because the first puppy isn't [17:03] showing that same motivation [17:05] does not mean that by two years old [17:06] isn't going to be [17:08] same or higher quality than that third [17:10] puppy so [17:12] don't compare puppies especially when [17:14] they're different lines [17:15] because different lines are going to [17:16] mature at different rates and have [17:17] different qualities [17:18] so the first puppy that we saw his dad [17:21] is a french ring three selective [17:22] and has a really nice full pushing [17:25] really really hard bite [17:26] so his style if you saw every time that [17:28] he bit he had a nice full mouth [17:31] if you saw the second puppy when he bit [17:33] he was very content with whatever he had [17:35] and his line is more french french ring [17:38] where they don't care as long as the dog [17:40] is biting they don't care if he's biting [17:41] with a more shallow mouth [17:43] because the dogs are trained to bite [17:44] everywhere including like right up here [17:46] which is impossible to have a full bite [17:48] so we are encouraging that puppy to have [17:50] a full bite [17:51] so as i'm training the bite work if he's [17:54] biting with half a mouth [17:56] i kind of freeze up for a second give [17:57] him the opportunity to push in and get [17:59] that full mouth [18:00] but if he doesn't i'm going to whip [18:01] around and he's going to learn that if [18:03] he's biting like this [18:04] he's more likely to have it slip out and [18:06] lose [18:07] right now it's kind of hard because of [18:09] their age they're beginning to teeth [18:10] so i really don't want to do too much [18:12] where i'm really pulling it out of the [18:13] dog's mouth [18:14] because i don't want them to have a hurt [18:16] tooth or get hurt and then have a [18:17] negative association [18:19] with the biting so with puppies a lot of [18:20] it is just building up that drive [18:22] building up the motivation [18:23] seeing what you have and then building [18:25] it from there so if i have a dog that [18:27] bites really hard but is happy with just [18:29] part of his mouth [18:30] i'm going to make sure that i'm only [18:31] going to reinforce i'm only going to let [18:33] that puppy win the sleeve [18:34] if they push in and they have a nice [18:36] full grip [18:38] like i said the second the third puppies [18:40] are littermates but you see their [18:42] gripping style is very different [18:43] so the the last puppy that came out when [18:46] you see he bites he bites full [18:48] he's really pulling on a leash and again [18:51] every puppy is different so [18:52] this morning because they get kind of [18:54] free range they get to run around he may [18:56] have been running around for two hours [18:57] before we started training this morning [18:59] so if you have a dog that doesn't have [19:00] as much gas in the tank or [19:02] sometimes isn't totally committed make [19:04] sure that you [19:05] one don't feed them breakfast that way [19:07] they're food motivated when you come out [19:08] to do your obedience [19:09] and two put them in the crate or make [19:11] sure that they're kept quiet before they [19:12] come out to bite work [19:13] that way they spend all of their energy [19:15] doing this activity [19:16] and not playing with their brother or [19:17] barking at the neighbor or playing with [19:19] your kids [19:20] so if you do have a dog that you are [19:21] working on certain things [19:23] make sure that their life is kind of [19:25] boring outside of the bite work at first [19:27] and that way they're really excited and [19:28] all of their energy goes to this [19:30] at the same time make sure you're taking [19:31] your puppy out and socializing them but [19:33] if you let the puppy play for two hours [19:35] before your bite work don't be surprised [19:36] if they don't bring 100 [19:38] they just don't have it to give hey [19:40] thanks for watching everybody i hope you [19:41]

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 51/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode today i'm going to be going over [00:04] some of the basics [00:05] when it comes to playing tug with our [00:07] dogs now it's going to change depending [00:09] on [00:10] the dog as well as the age of the dog so [00:12] i'm going to be giving you two examples [00:14] one with ari and then one with charlie [00:16] there's certain things that i like to do [00:17] to build the dog's confidence but i also [00:19] want to teach them to have what's known [00:21] as a [00:21] full bite so this is a shallow bite when [00:24] they don't have the tug [00:25] entirely in their mouth and then this [00:27] would be a [00:28] full bite in order to get that what i [00:30] like to do is i will pull [00:32] back on the tug and then i will go loose [00:35] i don't want to push it back into the [00:37] dog because i don't want to create any [00:39] sort of avoidance [00:40] all we want to do is we're pulling we're [00:42] pulling and then boom we go loose [00:44] and what will happen is your dog will [00:45] re-bite [00:47] on the tug once they re-bite then we [00:49] pull again because we want to make sure [00:51] when they re-bite they hold on nice and [00:53] tight [00:53] and then we can go into the play there's [00:55] another technique when they do bite into [00:57] me i'll push [00:58] back to show them that their bite or [01:00] their effort has an effect on me [01:03] i'll also do a little trick where i [01:06] showed the dog how strong they are [01:08] when they shake so they can rip the toy [01:10] from my hand [01:11] i'll keep it tight enough to where it [01:12] doesn't seem like i'm just handing it [01:14] to my dog but also not so tight that [01:16] they can't pull it away [01:18] okay so i'm going to demonstrate a [01:19] little bit of tug play with ari [01:21] i think good girl so she has a full bite [01:24] right now that's good [01:26] and now i'm gonna demonstrate the [01:28] technique right there [01:29] where she's able to rip it out of my [01:30] hands so i'm holding it [01:32] again tight enough to where it doesn't [01:34] seem like i'm just giving it to her [01:36] and here's a re-bite oh good girl but at [01:39] the same time [01:40] where she's strong enough to pull it [01:41] from my hands and we want them bringing [01:43] the toy back to us so [01:44] good right there she shakes again and it [01:47] rips it right out of my hand [01:49] because she's very strong good girl ari [01:51] very nice [01:52] giving her those wins are you out [01:56] no that was a little bit of a chewy out [01:58] need to work on that [02:01] now i'm going to demonstrate with the [02:02] re-bite where [02:04] more likely than not she's going to have [02:06] a full bite but i want to demonstrate [02:08] when i pull back [02:09] and then i go loose down giving her an [02:11] opportunity to re-bite [02:13] attack good girl so she has the full [02:16] bite but what i would do is i'd pull [02:18] and then i go loose good even right [02:21] there she still kind of did a little [02:22] re-bite [02:23] very nice ari i like to move back and [02:26] forth nice and smooth [02:28] i don't like to do jerky movements [02:29] because that's not going to be fun for [02:31] our dogs [02:32] so there she's not as full you can see a [02:34] little shallow i go loose boom [02:36] she re-bites good girl very nice i'll [02:38] switch my grip [02:39] so it gives me an opportunity to pet her [02:41] maybe tap her on the side a little bit [02:42] nice job ari [02:44] ari out at the good very nice [02:49] good and again she rips it away and she [02:51] wants to bring the toy back to me [02:53] sometimes i'll even push the dog away [02:55] like oh [02:57] oh and then she gets it to me and [02:59] awesome now we're gonna play again [03:01] again smooth motion back and forth [03:04] allowing our dogs to win [03:06] teaching them to re-bite good by pulling [03:09] and then going loose [03:11] another thing i'll do is if i have a dog [03:12] and i'm trying to work on them having a [03:14] tight grip [03:15] i'll walk and i'll do little pulls like [03:16] this so they know to keep it nice and [03:19] tight and then i'll go loose [03:20] good and they bite and push into me very [03:22] nice ari [03:24] good job excellent [03:27] ari out no out down [03:32] so that's an example with a little bit [03:34] more of a high drive dog [03:35] like ari i have to work a little bit on [03:37] her out [03:38] now i'm going to demonstrate with [03:39] charlie as well so the main things i'm [03:41] looking [03:42] for when i'm working tug with a puppy or [03:43] a dog smooth motion [03:45] again not jerky i don't want to take [03:48] away the fun [03:49] teaching them to re-bite and also [03:52] showing them that when they re-bite it's [03:53] going to push me back [03:55] encouraging that re-bite and encouraging [03:57] the dog to push into the [03:58] handler or if you end up transitioning [04:00] this later to bite work into the decoy [04:03] and giving them the ability to rip the [04:06] toy away from my hands [04:08] while also changing grip back and forth [04:10] to give us an opportunity to pet our dog [04:12] tap them on the side a little bit and [04:13] make it as fun as possible [04:15] all right so let's get charlie out here [04:17] i think [04:18] don't bite my hand i'll be right back [04:20] now with charlie [04:22] he's a little different his bite's not [04:23] as strong he's a lab [04:26] so with him i need to kind of boost him [04:28] up a little bit more [04:29] because what he wants to do is sometimes [04:31] if [04:32] i feel like i'm or if i'm acting like [04:34] i'm struggling he might go oh [04:36] sorry so we have to adjust according to [04:38] the dog [04:39] but you'll see how i'm going to play a [04:40] little bit differently with charlie here [04:42] i think [04:43] good boy his grip's not as strong so he [04:45] can slide off easily [04:46] all right charlie out down so for [04:49] example when he comes in for the bite [04:51] if i hold no not yet buddy if i hold it [04:53] very tight in one position [04:55] and swing around he'll probably slide [04:57] right off because his bite's not as [04:59] strong [04:59] so it's someone like charlie i'm gonna [05:01] extend [05:03] he heard his name i'm gonna extend my [05:04] right arm to make sure there's not [05:06] as much it's gonna make it easier [05:10] essentially for him to hold on i think [05:13] good [05:13] see how i allow it to go in the [05:14] direction he's going so he doesn't slide [05:17] off there he goes he has a nice good [05:18] full bite [05:19] again nice movements back and forth if [05:20] he shakes it oh he rips it out of my [05:23] hand excellent job he runs around a [05:25] little victory lap [05:26] comes back i want to get him to re-bite [05:28] so i pull tight and then i go loose [05:30] good he does a rewrite same thing see [05:33] i'm switching hands [05:34] not always having a bunch of eye contact [05:37] good boy buddy [05:40] so there's a pretty full bite let's give [05:42] him a re-bite again so loose [05:44] charlie very good [05:47] and reacting or responding at the exact [05:50] moment your dog re-bites [05:52] and then pulling again to make sure they [05:54] know that they need to [05:55] re-bite and hang on not re-bite and then [05:57] go loose again [05:58] good boy same thing we can take him and [06:00] push him away like oh get away from me [06:02] buddy [06:03] get away get away and then he wants to [06:05] bring the toy even more [06:06] we want our dogs to want to bring our [06:08] the toys to us [06:09] so we want to make it fun and again [06:10] switching the grip petting him good boy [06:13] very nice at that good so there you did [06:16] a nice little attack [06:17] or a nice little re-bite i should say [06:19] charlie out [06:22] no charlie out attack [06:26] am i out suck today in this video [06:29] charlie out [06:30] no out attack all right okay all done [06:34] buddy [06:35] so that's it very basic with a puppy [06:37] it's going to be a little bit different [06:39] you're not going to be able to pull as [06:40] hard you want to make sure the puppy [06:42] wins [06:42] but a lot of the concepts are going to [06:44] be the same it's just going to be a [06:46] little bit [06:47] lighter but again with puppies i always [06:49] want to make them win [06:50] i want them to enjoy the game i want to [06:52] increase their confidence [06:53] this gives us the ability to use our tug [06:56] toys [06:56] to make our obedience more fun for us as [06:59] well as our dogs [07:00] alright i hope you guys enjoyed today's [07:02] video let me know you think about in the [07:03] comments below and as always please like [07:05]

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 55/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode today i'm here at phd canines [00:04] with bethany [00:05] and we're going to be doing the brave [00:07] and french ring one [00:08] fundamentals with a young dog so the the [00:11] order of the exercises in the brave is [00:13] always the same and all of the other [00:14] levels it's going to change [00:16] but in the brave you always have your [00:18] leash [00:19] food muzzle absence and then for the [00:22] protection exercises you have your [00:24] defense and face [00:25] it's always in that exact order so again [00:28] the first exercise is going to be your [00:29] heel on leash [00:30] so we'll go to the prep line so the prep [00:33] line is just kind of your [00:36] it's not a start line but it's kind of [00:37] like your get ready line so it's going [00:39] to be a line that's three meters before [00:41] where it starts [00:42] so we're going to go in this direction [00:45] so i'm going to be on her prep line the [00:48] prep line [00:49] is where the deputy judge who i'm acting [00:52] as [00:52] is going to tell you what the exercise [00:54] is where you need to go [00:55] and any information that you need to go [00:57] so i'm going to tell her [00:58] this is going to be your heel on leash [01:01] i've got her leash and collar ready [01:02] you're going to start at that line [01:04] imagine there's an imaginary line next [01:06] to the code [01:06] and you're going to go one two three [01:10] four there's always a right turn and a [01:12] left turn [01:13] and three stops so then i'm gonna go up [01:15] to her start and i say [01:16] whenever she's ready there's no horn [01:24] here [01:26] so for this exercise you have to give [01:28] the dog a placement command [01:30] so even if you walk up and the dog [01:31] automatically sits you still have to [01:33] tell the dog [01:34] to sit or down it doesn't matter but [01:36] they have to take a position [01:38] so you have to tell them to sit or down [01:40] or stand it doesn't matter your choice [01:42] then the deputy judge will hand you your [01:45] things [01:46] and if you notice there's a separation [01:47] between the dog and the handler [01:50] so when you tell the dog to stay it's [01:53] sit stay you make your separation or you [01:56] can say [01:57] sit separate and stay we're getting into [01:59] details here [02:01] but the dog cannot be touching you you [02:03] have to make that separation [02:05] then the deputy judge is going to hand [02:06] you your things the collar has to be [02:08] attached to the front of the dog [02:10] the end of the leash has to be [02:12] completely in your hand no part of the [02:14] leash can be sticking up [02:16] okay and then there'll be a horn for her [02:17] to start the exercise [02:20] you have one job john luke [02:54] [Music] [03:02] um [03:14] so the double honk indicates the [03:16] exercise is finished [03:18] then she'll take off her equipment and [03:19] hand it to the judge [03:24] okay you can put him in a down in the [03:25] shade for a second we'll talk [03:28] so again to reiterate you have your prep [03:30] line before the cone [03:32] that's where the deputy judge is going [03:33] to tell you what the exercise is [03:35] the pattern usually in competitions the [03:38] cones will be different colored [03:40] or there'll be some way to mark them to [03:42] indicate your pattern [03:43] but there's always going to be a left [03:44] turn and a right turn [03:46] on your stops the dog does not have to [03:48] sit [03:50] most people will train a sit just to [03:51] help the dog stabilize into position [03:53] but in french ring the dog does not need [03:55] to do a focused heel and they don't need [03:57] to sit when you stop [03:59] so again you've got your prep line [04:00] that's where they tell you the [04:02] pattern of the exercise and what the [04:04] exercise is when you put on [04:06] so you walk up sit stay you do your [04:09] separation [04:10] you put the collar on your dog with the [04:13] clip [04:14] facing down end of your leash in your [04:17] hand [04:18] whenever you're ready there will be a [04:19] horn for you to start [04:21] when you hear the horn you go when you [04:23] hear the horn you stop double horn means [04:25] that it's finished [04:27] the way that this is scored you'll have [04:28] to look at your rule book but [04:30] essentially you want the dog's neck next [04:32] to your leg if the ears and the head go [04:34] behind it's considered lagging you'll [04:36] get points off if the shoulders go ahead [04:38] it's considered foraging and you'll get [04:40] points off so you want the dog's neck [04:42] next to your leg and the way that you [04:44] walk should be natural [04:45] so if you've got a really big dog like [04:47] him it's hard to [04:49] you know walk naturally because you're [04:50] gonna be hitting the dog in the head but [04:52] you do want to have some movement in [04:53] your arm just showing that you're not [04:54] doing an akc style [04:57] healing because they want a more natural [04:59] walk [05:00] another thing is you want the leash and [05:03] this is my dog pretend this is my left [05:05] hand [05:05] you want it in a loop towards you so if [05:07] the leash goes over the dog's [05:09] back you'll lose your whole exercise [05:12] they won't let you start you'll get a [05:13] zero for that [05:14] so make sure these are really simple [05:15] points that you as a handler can lose [05:18] make sure that when you put your collar [05:19] on the dog the clip is on the bottom [05:21] underneath the dog's neck [05:22] you've got that j coming next to you [05:25] with the end of the leash in your hand [05:27] when you honk [05:28] that means to go again it's a forward [05:30] exercise so you have to say the dog's [05:32] name so it would be [05:33] in this case omaha opa since he's in [05:35] french you start walking [05:37] on the horns you stop there's no [05:39] commands horn [05:40] you start and the double hornets [05:42] finished now [05:44] depending on how your dog's temperament [05:46] is if you have a dog that's [05:47] overly friendly or doesn't like [05:49] strangers when you take off the [05:51] equipment hand it away from the dog [05:53] so if i'm if my dog is here and i'm [05:55] handing it here and i've got a super [05:57] friendly dog [05:58] now i have a stranger coming up to to [05:59] take my equipment if you haven't trained [06:01] for this the dog would go hi [06:02] there's a friend and get super animated [06:05] and kind of lose control [06:07] or if your dog is aggressive they might [06:08] see a stranger walking towards you [06:10] so you can put your stuff on the [06:12] opposite side of you or put your dog in [06:13] a down [06:14] and go and hand your equipment off to [06:16] your deputy judge all of those things [06:17] are okay [06:18] just make sure that you know your dog [06:19] and you handle appropriately [06:22] okay so that's the heal unleash the next [06:25] exercise we've got leash [06:26] food so again i'm gonna be the deputy [06:29] judge so i'm at her prep line so it'll [06:30] be [06:30] a white line on the ground i'm gonna [06:32] tell her this is the food refusal [06:34] you're going to go in that box and then [06:36] you're going to hide in that blind [06:37] whenever you're ready so on her own [06:40] she's going to leave her dog [06:41] in the down and go there's going to be [06:42] no horns for this exercise [06:44] and tell the horn to come back [06:55] now watch the way that sarah enters the [06:57] blind you are not allowed to look back [06:59] at your dog [07:00] so when you enter the blind you're [07:02] almost going to do a side step once [07:03] you're inside the blind [07:05] usually there's a peak hole so you can [07:06] look out at your dog and then you're [07:08] going to exit the blind in the exact [07:10] same way [07:11] so for the brave we're going to do the [07:13] first toss as a brave [07:15] so my food thrower will come up if i'm [07:17] the judge i'm gonna instruct him how i [07:19] want him to throw [07:20] so i'm gonna tell him throw it about six [07:22] inches from the dog's feet [07:25] perfect so again there's no commands for [07:28] this you're not saying leave it she's [07:29] just leaving that dog in a down [07:30] the food thrower throws throws the food [07:32] so this is about a brave throw [07:34] so now we're gonna do a ring one throw [07:36] so i'm gonna have you just kind of put [07:37] it by his feet [07:39] so for the brave there's one piece of [07:41] food in [07:42] ring one two and three there's four [07:44] pieces of food [07:46] try again yep good boy [07:50] and again this is training so we can [07:51] praise the dog yep [07:55] good okay and then there's gonna be a [07:57] horn for the handler to come back to [07:58] their dog [08:03] now it's my job in training to be [08:05] watching the dog since her timing is [08:07] gonna be bad [08:07] if he goes to sniff if he goes to lick [08:10] you want to make sure you communicate [08:11] with the handler first [08:12] but in this case if he went to go [08:14] investigate the food i would tell him no [08:16] and there's another horn she tells the [08:20] dog to heal [08:20] now if you look he walked really wide [08:22] around the food in a trial [08:24] if the dog displaces more than one meter [08:26] you're gonna get points off [08:27] so in training she's gonna grab his [08:29] leash [08:31] and she's gonna walk him over the food a [08:32] couple times [08:40] he understands that he can't touch it [08:41] but we don't want him to be in so much [08:43] avoidance that he's scared to walk on it [08:47] so once she sees that the dog is [08:48] comfortable just walking over the food [08:50] then we'll pick it up all right so the [08:52] next exercise is going to be the heel [08:53] with muzzle [08:56] so for the brave it's not always but in [08:58] this case we're going to use the same [08:59] pattern so i'm going to be at her prep [09:01] line [09:04] i'm going to tell her what exercise this [09:06] is so this is going to be your heel with [09:07] muzzle [09:08] that's going to be your start spot we're [09:10] going to go one two [09:11] three four whenever you're ready [09:20] rest so she gave the command she made [09:22] her separation [09:23] i hand her her equipment [09:38] so if you notice after she put her [09:39] equipment on she kind of stood up so [09:41] that way the judge [09:42] is very clear when she's ready [09:54] and if you watch the dog's position his [09:56] neck is [09:57] next to her leg if you see his shoulders [10:00] go in front that means that he's forging [10:02] if i see his head go behind that means [10:03] that he's lagging [10:07] so this is training he was a little bit [10:08] in front so she just used her leash to [10:10] get him back in position [10:30] um [10:39] so we did leash food muzzle so the next [10:41] exercise is going to be absence [10:43] in the brave it's always going to be a [10:46] down position to start [10:47] so this time we're going to go in this [10:48] blind straight ahead so as your deputy [10:50] judge i'm going to ask her to come right [10:52] here [10:54] again at the prep line i'm going to [10:56] explain the exercise so this is going to [10:57] be your absence of handler [10:59] position is a down you're gonna go in [11:01] that invisible box in that blind [11:02] straight ahead whenever you're ready [11:16] for all of the levels brave through ring [11:18] three the absence is all going to be one [11:21] minute [11:23] and again same thing as the food refusal [11:25] when she goes into that blind she's [11:26] going to step [11:27] sideways and once she's in the blind she [11:29] can turn and look at the dog [11:34] we're going to fast forward this minute [11:54] hey [11:58] so in this exercise when you pick up [11:59] your dog you are going to go [12:01] in the direction your dog is facing so [12:04] if you put your dog in a down [12:05] and they're facing straight ahead and [12:07] then after the minute right they flop on [12:09] a hip and now their paws are facing this [12:11] way [12:12] when you pick up your dog you're going [12:13] to walk in this direction you are not [12:16] going to walk straight [12:17] where the blind was you're going to walk [12:19] in the direction your dog is facing [12:21] so if the decoy is over here and your [12:22] dog decides to be naughty and they flip [12:24] around now they're facing this way [12:26] if they're still not down you are [12:27] walking this way even if your blind is [12:29] over there you're going to go in the [12:30] direction the dog is facing [12:32] now when you're setting your dog up in [12:33] these boxes there's just a rectangle [12:35] that's on the ground [12:36] sometimes they're open and it's just [12:38] like a [12:41] open-ended rectangle but your dog's feet [12:44] need to be straight in the box and [12:46] facing the direction of the exercise [12:48] so if this muzzle is my blind right and [12:52] i'm going to go in that direction [12:53] the dog's feet and my feet need to be [12:55] facing this direction [12:57] if the dog is off by over i believe it's [12:59] 45 degrees i'll have to double check the [13:01] rulebook [13:01] but if they down like this you cannot [13:04] start the exercise you have to [13:06] re reset your dog so you just would tell [13:08] your dog a dog heal [13:09] you would start over go to your prep [13:11] line on your own walk back up to the box [13:13] and try again for all the attacks as [13:16] well the dog's feet cannot be facing [13:18] that line or cannot be past that line so [13:21] if [13:23] you have your leash all right so if this [13:25] is my line [13:26] in my imaginary box here [13:31] can you see it okay okay so this is my [13:33] box [13:35] i'm at my prep line here i'm gonna [13:38] pretend like this muzzle is [13:39] where the decoy is or my blind or [13:42] whatever [13:44] the box is not for the handler the box [13:46] is for the dog [13:47] so a lot of new people to the sport make [13:49] the mistake of trying to fit themselves [13:51] and the dog in the box [13:52] so if my box is only this big and i've [13:54] got an 80 pound german shepherd [13:56] and i'm healing into it like this i'm [13:59] only giving my dog that much space to be [14:00] in the box [14:01] so i want to make sure that i'm setting [14:03] my dog up to succeed [14:04] so when i walk up i'm here and that way [14:07] the dog has all of this space to do [14:09] their down straight [14:10] if i turn like this and i'm telling my [14:12] dog down i'm not facing the exercise [14:14] so i need to be straight and that way my [14:16] dog is also straight [14:18] now their feet cannot cross this line so [14:21] if i'm doing my [14:22] my protection exercises and i know that [14:24] my dog is super amped up [14:26] i'm not going to walk up to the line [14:27] here and ask my dog to down [14:29] because when they down their feet are [14:31] going to be over that line you're going [14:32] to have to start over [14:34] so if i know that my dog is super amped [14:36] i can even stop here [14:38] as long as my dog is not crossing the [14:39] line it's fine so if i know i have a dog [14:42] that does this when they lay down [14:43] i'm going to set myself up to see [14:45] succeed and i'm going to stop here [14:46] now the dog has to be in the box if the [14:48] dog stops way back here that doesn't [14:50] count [14:51] but know your dog and handle [14:52] appropriately [14:55] and that's it for the obedience for the [14:58] brave [14:59] so this is just a training exercise but [15:01] what this is training for [15:03] is for the face attack which is an [15:06] exercise in all of the levels [15:12] again you've got the horn to start the [15:13] exercise you've got the horn that tells [15:15] the handler to recall the dog [15:21] so by using this really long heavy [15:23] bungee [15:24] it makes the dog really push to get that [15:26] bite it's not just easy [15:28] it also protects our decoys so that [15:30] they're not getting hurt with the fast [15:31] dogs [15:32] and it makes it easy for the decoy to [15:35] target the dog [15:39] the bungee also helps to set the dog's [15:41] bite because there's tension on them [15:43] it discourages any kind of changing of [15:45] the grips and any munchiness [15:47] and if the dog were to let go [15:51] the dog would lose its grip [15:57] so that first bite was the right leg and [15:58] now jean-luc is doing the left leg [16:00] if you notice just like we did the puppy [16:02] fights he's kind of getting still the [16:04] dog re-bites and then he's going to move [16:06] again [16:09] there you go [16:16] so the horn is an authorization for the [16:19] handler to recall the dog [16:21] so in this exercise it's a recall not an [16:24] out in a guard [16:25] so cat is using a whistle to recall the [16:27] dog [16:30] and then she's using her tug to reward [16:32] the dog when it comes back [16:36] make sure you say her name before you [16:37] send her [16:40] so there the dog anticipated on the horn [16:42] so now i'm going to do the horn and [16:43] you're not going to send her [17:02] okay [17:16] huh [17:19] so we used a double horn there and just [17:20] teaching the dog that just because you [17:22] hear the horn [17:22] that does not mean that the next command [17:24] is going to be to send the dog [17:27] we want the dog to wait for our cues and [17:29] not anticipate [17:31] if the dog were to go before we sent the [17:33] dog it would be called [17:34] breaking the line and you lose your [17:36] points [17:41] so there the dog anticipated the down so [17:42] she just stopped the dog with the leash [17:58] horns [18:06] so you can see the bungee's making the [18:07] dog fight for that grip because if she [18:09] doesn't she's going to get pulled back [18:12] and here he's just desensitizing the dog [18:13] to the stick near the legs [18:15] and just kind of petting her with the [18:16] stick so that way it's no big deal [18:21] now he's doing a little bit of cover [18:23] make sure the dog is comfortable with [18:26] that [18:29] and then again in a triad here the [18:31] double horn which means exercise is [18:40] finished [18:54] yeah so whenever you change a decoy it's [18:57] better to check the dog's bite first [18:59] so that's why we put the dog on the back [19:00] tie we have the dog on the harness [19:02] and the bungee and we just did a couple [19:04] bites just to kind of see how the dog [19:06] reacts the new decoy hold on one second [19:07] sarah [19:08] um so once we check the grip the dog is [19:11] comfortable with the new decoy [19:12] the dog is comfortable on the bite then [19:14] we can start to actually train exercises [19:16] um because he's a young dog it's always [19:18] better to change one thing at a time [19:20] so in this situation it's a familiar [19:22] feel this is his normal kind of home [19:24] field [19:25] with a new decoy and then if you are [19:28] going to change to a new field you're [19:29] we're going to use [19:30] his normal decoy as the dog gets older [19:33] you can start going to a new field new [19:35] decoy but it's always better to make [19:37] sure that you have no problems [19:39] then go oh shoot the dog has the problem [19:41] because nate leans over a little bit [19:42] more than what he's used to [19:44] or he his grip is munchy and [19:47] he's able to practice that behavior [19:48] versus being on that bungee [19:50] where if he did try to do that he would [19:52] lose his bite and then we could build [19:53] frustration [19:54] so now that we've checked the dog's bite [19:56] the dog is obviously comfortable [19:57] and confident biting on the new decoy [19:59] now we can actually start to do [20:01] behaviors [20:02] so this dog is getting ready for a [20:03] competition for his brave which again is [20:06] that entry level [20:08] so we're going to do that now so in this [20:10] exercise the dog needs to stay with the [20:12] handler [20:13] it greets the decoy they say they're [20:15] hellos they say they're goodbyes [20:17] she's going to walk away the decoy is [20:18] going to come and sneak up behind her [20:20] the dog isn't allowed to bite until the [20:22] decoy is within one meter or makes [20:24] contact [20:25] after that on the horn the dog is going [20:28] to go [20:28] into a guard position so she's going to [20:31] tell her dog omaha out he's gonna stay [20:33] in the guard [20:34] the dog is gonna guard for about five [20:35] seconds i'm gonna honk the horn and then [20:37] she's gonna recall the dog and that's [20:39] the defense so we'll go through it now [20:43] so in in the brave um [20:46] the dog the decoy is going to touch with [20:48] one hand because in the other hand [20:49] they're going to test for gunfire [20:50] so they're going to make contact with [20:52] one and then just raise your hand and [20:53] pretend like you're shooting with the [20:54] other [20:57] okay so she's going to be at her prep [20:58] line this is going to be the defensive [21:00] handler go ahead and go to your start [21:01] line whenever you're ready [21:08] so just like all the other behavior she [21:10] gives the dog a placement it doesn't [21:11] matter if sit down stand she's making [21:13] her separation and then the judge will [21:14] honk the horn to begin [21:28] today [21:42] perfect [21:47] so this bite is about 10 seconds there's [21:50] gonna be honk [21:53] the dog goes into that guard position [21:54] and stays with the decoy [21:56] so here the dog is looking at there you [21:59] go go ahead and escape [22:01] so because this is training and the dog [22:03] wasn't looking at the decoy [22:04] we're gonna give him a re-bite [22:08] good now recall him no horn [22:12] there we go so if you saw after that [22:14] second re-bite the dog was vigilant [22:16] which means he was focused on the decoy [22:17] that's what we want we don't want the [22:18] dog guarding and staring at the owner [22:20] so if the dog is staring at the owner [22:22] versus guarding the decoy [22:24] he's still in the right position but [22:25] it's a lot easier for the decoy to get [22:27] meters [22:28] on some other exercises including the [22:30] guard or firm or the pistol attack [22:33] i

First: We use what's known as reward-based training. This means we offer the dog a reward to get the dog to do what we like. This training only works if the dog wants the reward that you are offering. Second: We use what is known as leash pressure. This is when we use a leash to guide our dog into each position. Third: This is what's known as escape avoidance training. This is when the dog is going into the desired position to escape or avoid a correction. This is not a recommended option. Fourth: This one is called free shaping. This is when we don't have anything in mind we would like the dog to perform, but when they do something we like, we reward them for it. Fifth: This is what's known as fixed shaping. We have something in mind we want the dog to do, but we don't directly show them as with luring or leash pressure. Instead, we put the dog into a specific situation that will get the dog to do the desired task. Next is understanding timing, When our dogs do a behavior, we have approximately one second to let them know we would like that behavior repeated, or we would not like that behavior repeated. Let's say we asked our dog to sit. The moment the dog's butt hits the ground, the timer starts. Within that first second, we have to either give the dog the primary reinforcer which is food, a toy, or affection."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 58/841,"Or we can give the dog the conditioned reinforcer (also known as a marker) which is a sound (such as a click) that predicts a reward. Each word only has value to our dogs based on what the word predicts. This comes from the studies conducted by Ivan Pavlov. He found that if the same sound always preceded a reward, the dogs would eventually begin to salivate when they heard the sound even before the food was present. This is what he called classical conditioning. We have to keep this in mind when we are conditioning our dogs to our markers, also known as conditioned reinforcers. We make the sound, then we deliver the reward. After enough repetitions, your dog will become conditioned to the sound and you will then be able to use it in your training. So let's go back to the sit. If you give your dog the primary within the first second, then you have effectively shown your dog that it was a behavior that you liked. But what if you use the conditioned reinforcer? How long would you have to deliver the primary to your dog before you lose the connection? Well, you have as much time as the dog is paying attention to you. Once we understand this, then we are ready to put it all together. If you can understand the science of dog training, you can master the art!"
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 59/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone nate shomer here and in [00:01] today's video i'm going to break down [00:03] the science you need to know [00:04] to teach your dog any command [00:16] first we must understand that everything [00:18] our dogs do is based on motivation [00:20] they're either motivated to access [00:22] something pleasant they're motivated to [00:24] prevent something unpleasant [00:25] or the behavior itself is fun this is [00:28] what's known as a self-reinforcing [00:30] behavior [00:30] when we teach a dog a behavior we have [00:32] five different ways to accomplish this [00:34] one we use what's known as reward based [00:36] training we offer the dog a reward to [00:38] get the dog to do what we like [00:40] this training only works if the dog [00:42] wants the reward that you are offering [00:44] so make sure it's a treat or toy your [00:45] dog enjoys two [00:47] we use what's known as leash pressure [00:49] this is when we use the leash [00:51] to guide our dog into different [00:52] positions third is escape avoidance [00:55] training [00:55] this is when our dog is going into a [00:57] position to escape or avoid a correction [01:00] this is not one of my recommended [01:02] options four [01:04] is known as free shaping this is when we [01:06] don't have anything in mind we want our [01:07] dogs to do [01:08] but the moment our dog does a behavior [01:10] that we like we mark [01:12] and reward that behavior fifth option is [01:14] known as fix shaping [01:15] this is when we have something in mind [01:17] we want our dogs to do [01:18] but we don't directly show them as with [01:21] luring or leash pressure [01:22] but instead we put the dog in a specific [01:25] situation [01:26] that will get the dog to do the desired [01:28] task you can see a great example of this [01:30] in my scent detection series [01:32] next is understanding timing when our [01:34] dogs do a behavior [01:35] we have one second to let them know if [01:37] we would like them to repeat that [01:39] behavior [01:39] or one second to let them know if we [01:41] would not like them to repeat that [01:43] behavior let's say we ask our dog to sit [01:45] the moment the dog's butt hits the [01:46] ground the timer starts [01:49] within that first second we have to [01:51] either give the dog the primary [01:52] reinforcer [01:53] which is food toy or affection or we can [01:56] give the dog the condition reinforcer [01:59] also known as a marker which is a sound [02:01] such as a click [02:02] or the word yes that predicts a reward [02:05] if we use a condition reinforcer we must [02:08] pay our dogs with the primary [02:10] this is the same as money for humans [02:12] money is only valuable [02:14] because it always predicts a primary our [02:16] markers to our dogs will only be [02:18] valuable [02:19] if they always predict the primary each [02:21] word only has value to our dogs based on [02:24] what that word predicts [02:25] this comes from the studies that were [02:27] conducted by evon pavlov [02:29] he found that if the same sound always [02:31] preceded a reward [02:33] the dogs would eventually begin to [02:34] salivate when they heard that sound [02:37] before the food was present this is what [02:39] he called classical conditioning [02:41] also known as the dinner bell theory [02:43] however if the sound came [02:45] while the food was being delivered yes [02:52] three or if the sound came while the [02:55] dogs were eating [02:56] yes [03:02] free they would never become classically [03:05] conditioned [03:06] we have to keep this in mind when we are [03:08] conditioning our dogs to our markers [03:10] again also known as condition [03:11] reinforcers we make the sound [03:14] then we deliver the reward after enough [03:16] repetitions your dogs will become [03:18] conditioned to the sound [03:19] and you will then be able to use this in [03:21] your training [03:22] so let's go back to the sit if you give [03:24] your dog the primary within the first [03:26] second [03:27] then you have effectively shown your dog [03:29] that it's a behavior that you would like [03:31] but what if you use the condition [03:32] reinforcer how long would you have to [03:35] deliver the primary [03:36] before you lost the connection well you [03:38] have as long as a dog is paying [03:40] attention [03:41] such as in this video you can see i give [03:43] my dog ari the sick command [03:45] the moment her butt hits the ground i [03:47] say the yes marker [03:48] then i start to walk towards my dog [03:50] grabbing a treat [03:52] and handing it to her and you can see [03:54] she's focused on me the entire time [03:56] and now even though that reward came way [03:58] after [03:59] the behavior i was trying to capture my [04:01] dog knows whatever she was doing [04:03] when she heard the sound is what she's [04:05] being rewarded for [04:06] once we understand this then we are [04:08] ready to put it all together [04:10] let's picture the four steps on a [04:12] timeline the first step is the command [04:15] this can be physical or a verbal command [04:18] the second [04:18] is the motivation this is the physical [04:21] cue that gets the dog to do the behavior [04:23] the third step is to either mark or [04:25] reward if you use the primary in this [04:28] step [04:28] then the process is complete if you use [04:30] the marker [04:31] then you must move on to the last step [04:33] which is giving your dog the primary [04:35] reward [04:36] now when teaching this process to a dog [04:38] we must start at the end [04:40] and work our way forward first we must [04:42] find a treat that our dog enjoys [04:44] then we have to condition our dogs to [04:47] the markers as explained earlier [04:49] this is known as loading the markers and [04:51] it's also known as [04:52] engagement training next we have to show [04:54] our dogs [04:55] what we would like them to perform with [04:57] a physical cue it doesn't matter if [04:59] you're teaching a sit [05:00] or something more complicated like [05:02] ringing a bell you must first find a way [05:04] to get the dog to do the behavior every [05:07] time with the physical cue [05:09] once you've completed that step then you [05:10] can move on to the last step [05:12] which is giving the behavior a command [05:14] remember the command can be verbal [05:16] or it could be physical as you can see [05:18] on the timeline [05:20] you can now give the command follow it [05:22] with the physical cue [05:23] then the reward or marker and finally [05:25] the reward [05:26] if you use the marker now you will [05:28] repeat this process [05:30] as many times as it takes for your dog [05:32] to do the behavior [05:33] on the command alone so you deliver the [05:35] command and before you're even able to [05:37] give the dog the physical cue [05:39] they're already doing the behavior now [05:41] it doesn't matter if you're training for [05:43] competition obedience [05:44] basic obedience or anything in between [05:47] the process is always the same [05:49] and if you can understand the science [05:51] you can master the art [05:53] i hope you guys enjoyed today's video [05:54] let me

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 67/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode today we're going to be doing [00:03] some fun protection training and [00:04] obedience in the sport of french ring [00:06] bethany is going to be explaining [00:08] exactly what we're going to be doing in [00:09] this video [00:10] so we're going to be training my [00:11] three-year-old male german shepherd [00:13] named gunner [00:14] he has both legs of his level one um and [00:17] we're gonna kind of review some of that [00:18] since he's been out for about six months [00:20] from an injury [00:20] so we're gonna slowly build them back up [00:22] so we're gonna go over some ring one [00:23] exercises and then we're also gonna do [00:25] uh probably all three retrieves so for [00:27] level one two and three [00:29] which is a throne retrieve the scene [00:31] retrieve and the unseen retrieve [00:33] we'll probably work on some positions [00:35] and then we'll do the bite work [00:37] exercises [00:37] which is the face the flea the defensive [00:40] handler [00:41] and the guard affirm or the pistol [00:42] attack those are the ring one [00:44] exercises for and they can be in any [00:46] order um so we're [00:47] gonna go through all of those and then [00:48] we'll see how he does excellent and if [00:51] you guys [00:51] have any questions make sure you throw [00:53] those in the comments below so let's [00:54] jump right in [00:56] so this is gunner he is a [00:59] three-year-old german shepherd he has [01:01] both legs of his [01:03] ring one which means that he's passed [01:05] under two different judges at two [01:06] different trials [01:07] um with passing scores um i have [01:11] my socks for my retrieves [01:14] i have my whistle for my recall our [01:16] language is english [01:18] i have got all my toys and anything that [01:20] i need for the training [01:21] um he's been out since december because [01:24] he had some [01:25] health issues um but we're trying to do [01:28] his rehab so we're gonna do [01:29] even though he understands the jump we [01:32] have it just dropped really low with my [01:33] target [01:34] um and just the key so that way he can [01:36] be successful because he's still [01:37] building up his muscles again [01:39] um so we'll get started with him [01:42] gunner heel so he likes to turn to the [01:45] right as you see he's kind of pushing me [01:46] so i'm gonna do a left turn [01:48] just to get him out of my way [02:03] one two three [02:09] down stay [02:18] gonna jump [02:23] place no [02:29] okay place place good [02:33] break here place [02:37] good here ready place [02:42] no down [02:49] good heel so his jump was good but i [02:53] didn't like his place so i'm just gonna [02:54] make him do it again [03:01] down stay [03:12] better jump stay [03:18] i like that so i'm gonna reward it good [03:26] good boy good oh [03:31] we're going to do it again [03:42] down stay [03:52] gonna jump [03:58] stay [04:02] down gotta jump [04:06] good boy good boy [04:11] good job buddy good [04:19] good done [04:25] gunner heel [04:31] so i'm gonna do my retrieves i'm gonna [04:33] do my ring one retrieve and then we're [04:35] also working on our ring two retrieve so [04:37] we'll go ahead and do both of those [04:38] gunner heel [04:49] my prep line got our heel [04:55] sit stay [04:57] [Music] [05:05] [Music] [05:07] gonna search and bring [05:16] so this would be okay in a trial because [05:18] i can still reach it [05:20] without moving my legs but see how far i [05:22] have to reach done [05:23] so i'm gonna make him do it again i'm [05:24] gonna make him come closer spring [05:27] so i'm just gonna pet him that way i can [05:29] help keep him close [05:30] good [05:34] and so see when he sits back he sits [05:36] farther away so i'll probably [05:38] done i will use a leash to fix that [05:50] sit stay [05:53] so for the ring two retrieve the dog has [05:56] to go [05:56] past you you're not allowed to stop [05:59] walking until [06:00] the dog pass you so you can either teach [06:02] the dog to come to front position [06:04] or we've been working on teaching him to [06:06] go around this [06:07] pole [06:11] stay so to warm him up i'm just going to [06:15] send him around it heal [06:19] go around yeah go boy [06:24] and now i'm gonna do it with my retrieve [06:26] sit stay [06:29] gunner heel [06:33] go around good boy [06:36] nice job so i'm not going to worry about [06:38] him holding it i'm going to go ahead and [06:39] give him [06:40] his reward i'm not going to work on two [06:42] things at once so right now i'm working [06:43] on him [06:44] going in front and going around so i'm [06:46] not going to work on him coming to front [06:47] at the same [06:48] time good he is a little slow to out [06:51] that's his normal so whenever i am going [06:53] to out him [06:54] i use an e-collar for him so i have my [06:56] remote ready and the way that i'm kind [06:57] of turning my body [06:58] so that he can't see it gunner out [07:04] and then i make sure that he's gonna be [07:05] clean after [07:07] good heel so now i'm gonna out [07:11] now i'm gonna add a little bit more [07:14] distance heel [07:17] heel sit good gunner heel [07:24] heel [07:28] sit good stay [07:31] gunner heel [07:37] go around yes [07:41] good job buddy [07:46] come gunner out [07:50] out yes [07:54] good good gunner out [08:01] gunner out [08:11] gunner heel [08:16] perfect nice job buddy [08:22] we can't have both go boy so that's it [08:26] so [08:27] down so on that last round without me [08:30] having to tell him around [08:31] tell him to go he went around that so [08:33] that was perfect so i'm gonna end my [08:34] lesson on that good note [08:35] we'll do our position changes yeah [08:47] so for this exercise i don't want him [08:49] focused on me so i actually dropped the [08:52] his reward behind him gunner heel [08:59] sit stay [09:02] when it comes to training a dog for more [09:04] advanced obedience [09:06] reward placement is something you want [09:07] to keep in mind you're going to notice [09:09] in this shot bethany places the toy [09:11] behind the german shepherd gunner the [09:14] reason for this [09:14] is because she doesn't want gunner to [09:16] start moving forward [09:18] she wants him to think about the toy [09:19] being behind him so in his mind if he's [09:22] doing the change of position exercises [09:24] and he knows when he's released he's [09:26] going to have to turn around and go the [09:27] other way [09:28] this is going to prevent him from moving [09:30] forward towards the handler [09:32] that's a common problem that a lot of [09:33] people run into when doing this exercise [09:35] so the shaping box and the toy is going [09:38] to help prevent that from happening [09:39] another thing you want to notice is [09:41] during this exercise [09:43] bethany repeats the command down a few [09:45] times in one of my other videos i talk [09:47] about not repeating commands [09:49] however that's when you're teaching the [09:51] command to the dog because when you're [09:52] teaching the dog the command you're [09:54] still going to do the physical cue [09:55] afterwards [09:56] until the dog beats you into the [09:58] position meaning you say down [10:00] then you do the cue down then you do the [10:02] cue [10:03] down boom the dog laid down without that [10:05] cue [10:06] now you can remove the physical cue and [10:08] just use the verbal command [10:09] when you're at the point of using the [10:11] verbal command what some people will do [10:13] if the dog makes a mistake meaning the [10:14] dog is actively trying to do what you're [10:16] asking them to perform [10:18] they will use what's known as a [10:19] non-reinforcement marker this is a [10:21] sound or a signal for negative [10:24] punishment which is [10:25] removing a reward or not giving a reward [10:27] to the dog [10:28] so let them know you made a mistake [10:30] you're not going to get your reward [10:32] but you could try again in this [10:33] situation instead of using a [10:35] non-reinforcement marker [10:36] a lot of trainers will simply pause give [10:39] the dog a second and then they will [10:41] repeat the command to see if the dog can [10:43] figure it out [10:43] because you'll notice gunner is trying [10:45] to do what she's telling him to do [10:47] but he's a little thrown off so after [10:49] she tries a couple times [10:50] she moves forward and she does it with [10:53] the leash to be able to assist him to [10:54] make sure he doesn't continue to make [10:56] the mistakes [10:57] but i wanted you to be aware of that [10:58] while you're watching this shot so let's [11:00] check it out [11:03] stand [11:08] down [11:12] down down [11:16] good stand [11:21] down down [11:26] down [11:28] good stand [11:33] no stand down [11:38] very good stand [11:42] down get it good boy [11:47] so i decreased my distance i threw a [11:49] leash on so i can help the dog [11:51] and i wanted him to be successful [11:56] gunner out good [12:00] so i'm gonna do it easy for him again [12:05] so the sequence that he had the problem [12:07] with was the the down to the stand or [12:09] the stand to the down [12:10] down stay [12:15] nope yo [12:21] down stay [12:36] stand [12:42] down [12:46] get it good boy [12:50] good boy [12:57] gunner out [13:04] yo [13:06] sit stay [13:10] no sit stay [13:15] sit stay [13:33] get it go boy [13:37] good boy go boy [13:41] good good gunner [13:44] out deal [13:51] down stay [14:02] stand [14:05] down [14:09] stand [14:12] down get it [14:16] perfect [14:22] so now i'm gonna do kind of my intro to [14:24] my ring three retrieve [14:26] okay so in level three there is a [14:28] retrieve with a scent discrimination [14:30] and essentially what you do is you walk [14:32] you have to drop your retrieve [14:34] before you get too far out of your right [14:36] pocket [14:37] the dog is not allowed to grab it right [14:39] away you go about halfway down the field [14:41] the decoy will honk the horn which means [14:43] that you get to turn around [14:45] and then you send your dog for the [14:46] retrieve and then there will be one [14:48] other object that's not yours [14:50] and the dog has to find and retrieve [14:51] only your object [14:53] so i'm going to show you how i get [14:54] started with him he only has his level [14:56] one [14:57] but it's always good to be training [14:59] ahead so what i'm going to do [15:01] is i'm going to get him ready and i'm [15:03] going to use my voice to kind of tell [15:04] him to not grab it [15:06] so for my scene retrieve where i'm [15:08] dropping with this hand [15:10] i'm very uppy and it's no gun or heal [15:12] and that's kind of his cue [15:14] to be animated when i drop it on my [15:16] right it's going to heal [15:17] and i'm using my tone of voice to kind [15:19] of indicate i don't want you to touch it [15:21] so to start i'm not going to do very [15:23] much distance i'm just going to kind of [15:24] go over the pattern [15:25] so it'd be gunner heel i walk [15:28] i drop it [15:32] i turn [15:36] gunner search and bring good boy [15:42] good done good [15:49] good and now we're going to add a [15:51] distraction [15:53] that's going to be a non-food item can [15:54] you describe a red cup cat [15:59] gunner heel [16:09] gonna search and bring good boy [16:12] so a little bit of a distraction there [16:14] but it's not something that's gonna be [16:15] super fun to retrieve [16:18] good done good boy [16:22] got her heel and now we're going to add [16:26] a little bit more distance sending him [16:29] gunner heal [16:44] gonna search and bring good boy [16:48] very nice very good [16:52] good done good [16:56] heel [17:00] good and that's basically it he did [17:02] really good on there it's the [17:04] first couple times that i've trained so [17:05] i'm not gonna ask for too much but [17:07] that's how i start the level three [17:08] retrieve so i'm at my prep line i'm [17:10] gonna go to my start box [17:12] gunner heal because he's really amped up [17:14] i'm gonna go back while i'm training [17:15] just to make him come with me [17:17] this next portion of the video is going [17:19] to be on some of the protection [17:20] exercises in french ring [17:22] now i'm not a certified decoy and this [17:23] is not an instruction on how to be a [17:25] decoy i just want to explain what i'm [17:27] doing so you have an understanding of [17:28] what you're watching [17:29] if you're not actively training for the [17:31] sport of french ring [17:32] so the first exercise that we do is the [17:34] face attack it's called the face attack [17:36] because the decoy has to face the dog [17:38] the entire time [17:39] on the first bite i want gunner to [17:40] target my right leg on the second bite i [17:42] want [17:43] gunner to target my left leg you're [17:45] going to notice whichever leg i want him [17:46] to target that's the one that's going to [17:48] be forward [17:48] and i'm going to have the clatter stick [17:50] in the same side hand so the first one [17:52] cladder stick in right hand second one [17:54] cladder stick in left hand [17:55] once gunner is close enough i take off [17:57] in the direction that i want him to bite [17:59] so if i want him to bite my right leg [18:01] i'm going to run backwards into [18:02] my right side keeping my right leg [18:05] closer to gunner [18:06] once he bites then i start to work him [18:08] it's going to be the same thing [18:10] on the left side you're going to notice [18:11] the left leg is forward i run backwards [18:13] on angle to my left side [18:14] making sure my left leg is closest to [18:16] gunner so he bites the left leg [18:18] then i start to work him i'm trying to [18:19] stay active i'm trying to stay engaged [18:21] i'm trying to make it fun [18:22] i'm petting him i'm talking to him i'm [18:24] moving the clatter stick back and forth [18:26] it looks like i'm hitting him with the [18:27] clatter stick but i'm really not i'm [18:29] just kind of going down and back up now [18:31] they're going to put a little bit more [18:32] pressure in a competition at the higher [18:34] levels [18:35] but during training at a lower level i'm [18:37] just kind of moving back and forth [18:38] tapping him a little bit pushing on his [18:40] face kicking my leg [18:41] keeping it active [18:45] down stay make my separation [18:54] yep [18:59] stay [19:03] stay so if you see him he's a little bit [19:05] animated so i'm just reminding him to [19:08] stay [19:22] good [19:26] way good boy [19:33] so we'll do the other leg [19:37] down stay [19:50] stay [19:54] stay [20:04] stay [20:16] nate on the horn keep working the dog [20:38] yup we'll do it again [20:46] yep [21:00] way [21:13] good sit [21:17] stay [21:21] got her heel the next exercise is going [21:23] to be the defensive handler again it's [21:25] going to be presented different [21:26] depending on what level the dog is [21:29] so on this one i walk up to bethany i [21:31] shake her hand i go past her [21:33] as i'm coming back i'm not doing too [21:35] much i'm walking straight towards her [21:37] i'm clearly tapping her on the back [21:38] which is the cue [21:40] for gunner to bite he bites and i work [21:42] him [21:57] hello hello how are you i'm good how are [22:01] you [22:01] i'm good cardio sucks holy cow [22:05] good way to get back in shape yeah [22:06] goodbye goodbye [22:24] oh [22:27] you want me to try to escape if he looks [22:28] away [22:31] attack attack gunner out [22:49] he did that in a trial it cost me some [22:52] points [22:54] uh guard a firm pistol [22:59] we'll just go this way heal stay [23:03] the next one is going to be the guard [23:04] affirm or the pistol attack [23:06] during this exercise you're also facing [23:08] the dog but you have a pistol in your [23:09] hand [23:10] as he's coming towards me i'm acting as [23:12] if i'm firing the pistol in the air and [23:14] then when he's on the bite i'm acting [23:16] like i fire one more time [23:17] and then i'm moving i'm staying active [23:19] and again trying to make it fun [23:20] trying to keep it alive this is part of [23:23] the exercise where the dog must continue [23:25] focusing on the decoy when given the out [23:27] clatter sticks are recalls pistol she's [23:30] going to have to come and grab the [23:31] pistol from me after the exercise [23:33] but she tells gunner to out and to guard [23:36] so as he's sitting in front of me [23:38] i look up i wait for the judge to give [23:40] me the cue once the judge gives me the [23:42] cue i jump back and that's where you [23:44] would try to take meters from the dog if [23:45] you take meters you take points [23:47] but you can see he catches me pretty [23:49] quickly i'm not that fast [23:51] once he bites work him again out and [23:53] then wait [23:54] look at the judge the judge says okay i [23:57] jump away again attempting to make [23:58] another escape [23:59] he bites work him again out guard and he [24:02] has to watch and then bethany comes up [24:04] and takes the pistol [24:24] gunner out guard [24:44] guard [24:54] [Music] [24:58] guard [25:00] so in a trial he would have a gun [25:03] and i would disarm him okay [25:20] sit [25:23] do a short flee so this is going to be [25:27] the flea attack it's the [25:28] the four exercises in the ring one one [25:30] down [25:31] stay so you've got the defensive handler [25:33] you've got the face attack [25:35] you've got the pistol or the guard afirm [25:37] and then you have the flea attack [25:38] so the flea attack is an escaping [25:40] exercise as if the bad guy is running [25:42] away [25:42] so nate would come with a stick he would [25:44] kind of antagonize the dog [25:46] he would run away yeah go ahead so what [25:48] he's going to do he's going to come and [25:49] tease the dog he's going to try to get [25:50] the dog to break the stay [25:52] and then as he runs away there's going [25:53] to be a horn i'm going to send my dog to [25:55] attack [25:56] any of the exercises with the stick is a [25:58] recall command so when he's on the bite [26:00] after the horn [26:01] i'm going to recall the dog back to me [26:03] gunner heal [26:09] down stay [26:36] good

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 71/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode today i'm at the tom rose school [00:04] of missouri [00:04] now as a lot of you may already know [00:06] this is where my dog training career [00:08] started [00:08] i was a professional and master student [00:10] here and eventually became [00:12] an assistant instructor about seven [00:14] years ago tom and i put together a [00:15] series [00:16] of videos to help teach people how to [00:18] train their dogs and we're gonna show [00:19] some of those to you [00:21] today let's go ahead and jump right in [00:27] another trick that we use in dog [00:28] training is what's called leash pressure [00:31] work [00:32] basically what we're going to do is [00:33] we're going to teach the dog to go [00:36] with the pressure on the leash now if [00:38] you do this exercise [00:39] some of the proofing exercises in some [00:41] of our other videos [00:42] with the stay command where you apply a [00:44] little pressure the dog maintains the [00:45] position you mark and reward [00:47] uh you can no longer do that because [00:48] right now in this particular exercise [00:50] i'm going to teach the dog to go with [00:52] the leash to go [00:54] with the pressure on the leash and this [00:56] is something that i introduce the dogs [00:58] usually around five months or so of age [01:00] and [01:01] i do this by simply pulling in a [01:03] straight line [01:06] what's going to happen first is your dog [01:07] is going to have what's called a [01:09] classical opposition reflex [01:11] you pull one way the dog hunker backs [01:13] the other way uh we see it all the time [01:15] with people where they're walking their [01:16] dog down the on a leash for the first [01:18] time [01:19] and the dog hunkers down and pushes back [01:21] as they try to pull the dog forward [01:22] so that's the classical opposition [01:24] reflex and we're going to teach the dog [01:26] to go with the leash so all i'm going to [01:27] do and this dog has been trained on this [01:29] so he's going to go rather quickly [01:31] but i'm going to pull pressure i'm going [01:33] to pull until he [01:34] decides to go with it once he goes with [01:36] it the pressure comes off [01:38] and i mark and reward [01:42] yes [01:46] yes yes [01:51] and what's really nice about this once [01:52] the dog understands it [01:54] i can utilize it to each other behavior [01:56] so for this particular dog [01:57] i taught him to walk backwards with this [01:59] a little pressure back [02:02] yes and you see how he quickly walks [02:04] back [02:06] so i'm not giving him any commands [02:10] and now he's at the point where he knows [02:14] a little bit of pressure [02:19] yes means to move backwards or to move [02:22] with it [02:22] this is a really useful tool if you have [02:25] a dog that's not food motivated [02:26] to get them into particular positions [02:28] that you want whether it be heel [02:29] position [02:30] uh the front position it doesn't matter [02:32] we can use the pressure [02:34] so i can guide him [02:37] yes with the leash once again to get him [02:41] into the positions that i want and this [02:42] is once again just that physical cue [02:45] that's going to help the dog get into [02:46] the positions [02:49] and you see i didn't give any commands i [02:51] simply guided the dog [02:52] with the leash and then once a dog [02:54] understands [02:55] that every time i pull this way and i [02:57] guide them now i can put the command [02:59] on a verbal cue so yes so if i have him [03:04] in front of me [03:06] and i take the leash now i want him to [03:08] come into the front i can say [03:09] come [03:14] yes once he's in position i'm marking [03:16] reward same thing if i want to go into [03:18] the heel position [03:22] yes and this is again where you utilize [03:25] climb to get your dog to go into [03:29] different positions [03:30] and it's also a good tool if your dog's [03:31] not food motivated now [03:33] this dog is food motivated so what i [03:36] could also do [03:37] free is i can get the dog in a position [03:41] and then simply guide him with the food [03:44] yes [03:46] heel so guiding him around in position [03:50] climb yes [03:55] this next training exercise is called [03:57] random sits and downs [03:58] and the purpose of this exercise you [04:00] don't want to start this really until [04:01] the dog [04:01] is starting to get a better [04:03] understanding of sits and downs [04:04] and for this uh particular exercise i'm [04:07] going to use my non-reinforcement marker [04:09] so [04:10] i'm not going to correct them for [04:11] mistakes at this point and what i'm [04:12] going to do is i'm going to give him a [04:13] command [04:14] the moment he gets into the position [04:16] that i'm asking for i'm going to release [04:18] him and give him a reward [04:19] so it's very similar to what we did [04:21] earlier with the climb commands [04:22] is once he gets in the position he gets [04:24] released so what the dog learns [04:26] is the faster i can to the sit faster i [04:28] get into the down uh the faster i get [04:30] released and i get to access my reward [04:32] so here's a quick demonstration of it [04:34] i'm gonna show you with this dog right [04:36] here and then we're gonna show you a few [04:37] other examples [04:38] free down free [04:43] patchy sit [04:46] free down free [04:50] edge down three [04:54] sit free down [04:58] free sit [05:02] free sit free [05:07] down free [05:10] climb so once again a really fun [05:14] exercise [05:15] and it teaches as a dog that they can do [05:17] the positions from wherever they are [05:19] and it speeds up those positions [05:23] okay this exercise we call the send out [05:25] it's going to teach the dog to follow [05:27] your hand [05:28] and basically we want the dog to run out [05:30] and what they're doing is they're [05:31] searching for some sort of reward [05:33] or something that you're directing them [05:34] to what we initially start off with is [05:36] we simply put food on a platform [05:38] and we send the dog to that food when [05:40] the dog progresses [05:42] then we start getting a little bit more [05:43] control of the dog [05:45] and we'll be able to start sending them [05:46] out so here's a few examples [05:48] run yes patchy [05:52] good boy [06:00] run yes [06:03] good boy buddy [06:14] run yes [06:19] free [06:23] good boy [06:28] run [06:32] free good boy buddy all right [06:37] what [06:42] this next exercise is called the [06:43] backwards follow exercise [06:46] and it really helps teach also the sit [06:48] front position [06:49] now the central position you can have it [06:52] as precise [06:53] as you want it to be so it's really up [06:55] to you we like to have the dog come in [06:57] as straight as possible [06:59] and as close to us as possible without [07:01] touching us [07:03] so once again this is completely up to [07:04] you if you have your dog just come in [07:06] and you're [07:06] okay with the dog being a little off to [07:08] the side or whatever and it doesn't [07:10] matter to you then that's fine [07:12] don't expect it for this particular [07:14] example i'm going to try and make the [07:15] dog [07:16] come in completely straight so what i do [07:18] when the dog's not in the position that [07:19] i desire [07:20] i'm simply going to recommand and walk [07:23] backwards again and give the dog the [07:25] opportunity to sit correctly then at [07:27] that point i'll mark and feed [07:28] so he's actively trying so i'm not going [07:30] to correct him if he's a little crooked [07:32] i'm just going to recommand do the [07:33] behavior again and then i'm going to [07:35] mark and reward when he does it the [07:36] right way [07:37] i also mark and reward as he's following [07:39] me so you'll see [07:40] i want him to be nice and close to me [07:41] the whole time and i'm going to mark [07:42] feed my feet and i'm gonna make it a fun [07:44] exercise for the dog should have a good [07:46] time with this exercise it is a fun one [07:49] come yes you also notice [07:52] when i feed i feed center line because [07:55] that's where i want the dog to be when [07:56] i'm walking [07:58] yes and i say yes and feed and i'm [08:01] feeding really close to i'm not feeding [08:03] way out here i'm feeding the dog right [08:06] next to me [08:06] so then when i come in and i stop [08:10] see how he's crooked i just walk [08:11] backwards yes [08:13] deliver yes deliver come [08:16] recommand walk backwards some more yes [08:19] so this becomes once again a really fun [08:20] exercise [08:21] the dog should like it and have fun with [08:23] it [08:25] come yes heal [08:28] and this is gonna help when you start [08:30] doing your recalls or calling the dog to [08:32] you [08:33] that's it [08:39] come and at the beginning i'm going to [08:41] walk backwards just to help them out [08:45] yes climb and doing these little things [08:48] the little body movements and stuff [08:50] is helping the dog in the early stages [08:52] the more you do it the less you're going [08:53] to need to actually give him that [08:55] physical guidance [08:56] but at the very beginning i say come he [08:58] starts coming to me i'm going to walk [09:00] backwards a little bit to show him that [09:01] picture [09:02] and then i'm going to mark and reward [09:03] that behavior [09:06] another one of the questions that we [09:07] often get here at the tom rose school is [09:09] how to teach a dog to go in and out of [09:11] the crate willingly and on command [09:12] a lot of people end up getting a [09:14] separation anxiety [09:16] where the dog goes in the crate they [09:17] start whining screaming barking making [09:19] all kinds of noise [09:20] because what happens is the owner will [09:22] put the dog into the crate and then [09:23] leave for work for eight hours [09:25] and the dog learns that when they go in [09:26] the crate they're going to be away from [09:28] them for [09:29] a long extended amount of time so what [09:31] we want to actually do is we actually [09:32] want to make this a training exercise [09:34] and make it fun for the dog if it's fun [09:36] for the dog they're going to learn it [09:37] faster [09:38] and it's going to be a positive [09:39] experience so what i first do to teach [09:41] my dog a crate command [09:43] is i simply show them a piece of food [09:45] that they want [09:46] once they see the piece of food i'm [09:48] going to throw it into the crate [09:50] this is going to be my physical cue or [09:51] my physical guidance [09:53] that's going to help the dog into the [09:54] crate once he goes in he's going to be [09:56] able to access his reward [09:57] then i'm going to give him his release [09:59] marker and he's going to be able to come [10:00] out and access another reward [10:02] so this is going to be a fun exercise [10:03] and you'll see what's going to happen is [10:05] he's going to start going into the crate [10:07] without even me throwing the food in [10:08] there without any command he's going to [10:10] go in there because he knows [10:11] that by going in the crate it predicts a [10:13] reward [10:16] break [10:19] free [10:24] see he even went in there before i threw [10:25] it free [10:30] so now that i have the physical cue the [10:31] dog understands free [10:33] to go in and out of the crate now i'm [10:36] going to say the command and then i'm [10:37] going to throw the food [10:38] crate see once again it's predictive he [10:43] hears the word crate [10:49] great and then i throw it in [10:58] yes and now i'm actually gonna reward [11:00] that behavior for just willingly [11:02] going into the crate uh what i'm gonna [11:04] do next [11:05] is i'm gonna start building duration [11:09] in the crate and i'm gonna get the dog [11:11] once again to happily and willingly [11:13] stay in there so he's staying in there [11:14] just like any of the other stay [11:15] exercises i'ma walk away [11:17] yes come back deliver a reward so he's [11:19] learning just by staying [11:21] in the crate even with the door open yes [11:23] i'm gonna come back and deliver reward [11:25] now when he's doing well and i want him [11:27] to act as a reward i say free [11:29] he could jump out and now access the [11:31] reward sit [11:33] once again i say crate then i throw the [11:34] food crate [11:37] and you see he's starting to anticipate [11:39] no crate yes [11:42] free he's starting to anticipate that [11:44] i'm going to throw the food in the crate [11:46] that's it crate [11:49] you do enough reps of this eventually [11:51] you will say crate [11:52] and the dog will willingly run into the [11:55] crate on command [11:56] now the next thing i do to build the [11:58] confidence and build [11:59] the dog being comfortable in the crate [12:01] is i will [12:02] close a door on them yes [12:06] then i deliver reward close the door [12:09] yes [12:13] yes [12:22] yes [12:26] yes and now he actually knows that he [12:30] can [12:30] come out of here whenever he wants free [12:36] it's about him willingly crate [12:40] willingly staying in it and doing that [12:43] by not saying i'm gonna close you in [12:45] here and keep you in here forever so [12:46] then what i would do [12:48] is i would start building more distance [12:50] and if i want at this point i can start [12:52] closing this i'll close it [12:53] i'll walk away i'll go around the corner [12:56] no [12:57] once i get around the corner i'll mark [13:00] and come back and reward so i go around [13:01] the corner you can't see me yes [13:03] then i go back and i deliver a reward [13:08] and you can do this with the door open [13:10] as well if he goes to come out no [13:13] crait [13:19] yes now i waited till i actually had [13:21] both his paws [13:22] inside the crate and not hanging out [13:26] touching the ground i'd go around the [13:28] corner yes [13:30] come back delivery award close the door [13:34] yes deliver a reward and this also helps [13:38] when you have the dog that when you go [13:39] to open the crate they're just trying to [13:40] rush out this is going to help with that [13:42] it's going to make the dog more [13:43] confident in the position free [13:47] crate see he still doesn't fully know it [13:50] so i say crate [13:50] and then throw yes [13:56] do this and you're gonna have a lot more [13:57] success and your dog is gonna willingly [14:00] go in and out of the crate and do it [14:02] with a positive attitude [14:05] next exercise is called finishes so it's [14:08] going to teach the dog to go from the [14:09] sit front position [14:10] to the heel position so there's two [14:12] different types of finishes that we [14:13] utilize [14:14] one is going to be your flip finish the [14:15] other one's called your buy finish [14:17] so for the flip finish i use the command [14:19] heel the same command that i used to [14:20] walk with the dog [14:21] and for my buy finish i use the command [14:23] buy you can use whatever words you like [14:25] really doesn't matter [14:26] just make sure that you're consistent [14:27] with that word so for the flip finish [14:30] what i'm going to do is i'm going to [14:31] give the [14:32] after the dog understands the physical [14:34] guidance then i'll put it to verbal cue [14:36] but first what i'm going to do is i'm [14:37] going to have the dog in the sit front [14:38] position i'm going to step [14:40] i'm going to use my hand to lower the [14:41] dog my left hand i'm going to step back [14:42] with my left leg [14:44] guide the dog around back in and then [14:47] i'm going to come back and straight [14:48] once the dog is straight in proper heel [14:50] position i'm going to mark and reward [14:52] proper heel position is the balls of the [14:54] dog's feet i'm sorry the balls of my [14:56] feet align with the dog's feet [14:59] patsy so i'm going to have him come into [15:02] the stiff front [15:10] yes [15:12] yes [15:16] so notice i'm not giving any commands at [15:17] this point i'm just showing the dog what [15:19] i want [15:22] yes once he's in that position [15:26] i mark and feed yes for the bi finish [15:29] i'm going to step back with my right leg [15:37] and this teaches the dog to stay close [15:38] to your body because at first they're [15:40] going to be a little wide and this just [15:41] kind of helps with that [15:43] as a dog becomes better and more fluent [15:45] at it i'm going to stop moving my leg if [15:47] i can just guide the dog out [15:49] and back in same with the bi finish [15:52] once they get a little better at it and [15:53] they understand it more i could take [15:55] away the leg movement [15:58] budgie [16:05] yes and then climb [16:09] after the dog understands it with the [16:12] physical uh cue [16:13] then i'm gonna put on verbal cue come [16:20] heal yes [16:25] come by [16:32] yes yes climb [16:38] and if you notice on that last one when [16:40] he came around [16:41] i wasn't satisfied with his position he [16:43] was a little bit off [16:44] so i just moved forward i gave him the [16:46] opportunity to reposition once he's in [16:47] the [16:48] correct position or the position i [16:49] wanted then i'm marked and rewarded [16:51] and this is a really good exercise to [16:53] teach your flip finish and your bi [16:54] finish [16:56] okay so this is a really quick version [16:57] of focus healing there's a lot to it and [16:59] there's a lot of detail [17:01] to really get the dog to understand [17:02] their head position body position [17:04] where they're supposed to move and how [17:05] they're supposed to move so it takes a [17:06] long time this is one that is definitely [17:09] not something that you want to rush and [17:10] it depends on how detailed you want it [17:12] so if you're doing [17:13] competitive type healing it's going to [17:14] take much longer if you just want your [17:16] dog to walk on a loose leash [17:17] all this is going to be doing is [17:18] reinforcing what we did earlier [17:20] as far as the attention getter so in the [17:22] dog who's walking next to you mark feed [17:24] mark feed mark feed [17:25] reinforcing that behavior getting the [17:27] dog to consistently want to do it when [17:28] i'm teaching a dog focused healing [17:30] i do not correct the dog in the heel [17:32] position [17:33] i want this position to be a really fun [17:36] a really positive position [17:38] so at the very beginning i'm going to [17:39] mark fee and mark feed constantly [17:41] rewarding the dog [17:42] for doing the behavior that i want and [17:43] then as he progresses i'm going to start [17:45] delaying the rewards but i'll also give [17:48] him some feedback at the beginning so [17:50] if i'm using my marker yes i have to [17:53] deliver a reward [17:54] but if i'm using verbal praise to give [17:57] the dog feedback without releasing them [17:58] from position or giving them a reward [18:00] i might do that in the beginning so i'll [18:01] say good boy good job let him know he's [18:04] doing good [18:04] without having to give him a reward so [18:07] what we're going to do is we start [18:08] with the backwards follow exercise once [18:11] a dog is following properly [18:12] i'm going to guide him over into the [18:14] heel position once he's there i'm going [18:16] to turn around and then [18:17] i'm going to start walking in the heel [18:18] position so at first we want to get the [18:20] dog confident looking up [18:22] paying attention to us and trusting us [18:24] so they can walk [18:25] forward with you in front of them [18:26] looking up at you now the dog is [18:28] confident he understands how to do that [18:30] and he trusts [18:30] you then we're going to transition to [18:32] move him over to the side and i'm going [18:34] to start with short sessions and build [18:36] on it [18:36] depending on how you feed the dog when [18:38] he's in that position is going to depend [18:40] on where his body is [18:41] so where the head goes the body follows [18:42] if my reward is way out here [18:44] my dog's butt is going to end up curving [18:46] in backwards if my reward comes in this [18:48] way [18:48] or if i have my reward over here the [18:50] dog's butt's going to come outward [18:52] because his head is going to be reaching [18:53] for the reward so when i deliver reward [18:55] i want it to be as straight as possible [18:57] to keep my dog straight so i'm going to [18:59] start with the backwards follow exercise [19:01] come so once he understands this and [19:04] he's walking looking up [19:05] i'm going to guide him to the side then [19:08] turn around [19:10] yes and then if he maintains that [19:12] position [19:14] i'm going to mark and reward or i can [19:15] tell him good boy good job giving him [19:17] feedback without releasing them [19:18] he's doing really good free then i'ma [19:21] let him jump up [19:21] act as a reward and have fun patchy [19:28] yes [19:32] yes heel [19:39] yes climb [19:43] you may have also noticed that when i [19:45] stopped he would sit [19:47] a real easy way to teach this if you [19:48] want your dog to sit every time you stop [19:51] is after he knows the sick command you [19:53] say sit he'll sit [19:55] then all you simply do is have him sit [19:57] every single time you stop [19:58] and just like anything else it becomes [20:00] predictive he's like oh i'm stopping [20:02] they're going to tell me to sit oh i [20:03] might as well sit anyways and then i [20:05] would just mark and reward that behavior [20:06] so you do it enough times the dog [20:08] predicts it and they do it on their own [20:10] and then you just mark and reward [20:11] it's really simple [20:16] so this exercise is called doodling and [20:20] the purpose of this exercise is to make [20:22] sure that the dog [20:23] really understands the sid front [20:25] position [20:26] and really understands the heel position [20:28] so after your dog already has a good [20:30] understanding of the sit front [20:31] and the heel position we're going to uh [20:34] teach the dog [20:35] these positions from multiple locations [20:37] so i'll put him in one position i'll [20:38] move to another position i'll call him [20:40] into heel [20:40] or i'll call him into the sit front [20:42] position and at the very beginning [20:44] i'm gonna help him with luring so i'm [20:45] gonna say the command then i'm gonna [20:47] lure him in position [20:48] once he's in position mark feed as he [20:50] gets a little bit better [20:51] i can start removing the actual help [20:53] with the luring and just doing it with [20:54] him getting in position marking and [20:56] feeding [20:57] apache so first i'm gonna guide him over [20:59] into heel position [21:02] yes sit yes [21:09] heal [21:12] yes sit [21:19] come [21:22] yes bye [21:28] sit [21:36] heel [21:39] yes sit [21:44] come yes [21:48] sit [21:54] heel yes [21:59] come [22:02] yes climb [22:05] yes so this is really going to help your [22:08] dog [22:09] understand that different position and [22:10] that heel position all right i hope you

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 74/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode today we are going to be [00:02] teaching our dogs [00:05] how to ring a bell now if you've been [00:08] following my dog training videos you [00:10] probably have a good understanding of [00:11] how i teach new behaviors [00:13] first we always want to make sure our [00:14] dogs know the markers remember the [00:15] marker is a word or sound that predicts [00:17] a reward this helps us pinpoint a moment [00:20] in time when our dog is right or wrong [00:21] the second step is to present a physical [00:23] cue that will get our dog to do the [00:25] behavior [00:26] every single time when presented so for [00:28] this behavior we are going [00:30] to be taking the bell and we are simply [00:31] going to be placing food [00:33] underneath the bell when our dogs try to [00:35] get to the food [00:36] we're going to mark and reward [00:38] eventually what's going to happen as [00:40] they're going to try to get the food [00:41] they're going to hit the bell [00:42] then you're going to give them the food [00:44] and we're going to continue to do this [00:45] until they understand the concept [00:47] once they understand the concept we can [00:49] go ahead and put it to a name [00:50] so when we put it to a name we say the [00:53] name so i was using the command bell [00:55] and then we present the bell so we say [00:56] the command then we present the bell [00:59] if you want the bell to predict going [01:00] outside or if you want that to be what [01:02] the bell means to your dog [01:04] once you teach the behavior simply tell [01:06] your dog to ring the bell [01:07] before letting them outside and after [01:09] enough repetitions [01:11] your dog's going to realize the action [01:13] of ringing the bell [01:14] predicts going outside and your dog will [01:16] start to do that behavior [01:18] all right let's go ahead and jump right [01:19] in this is going to be our first [01:21] session working the bell again it's a [01:24] very simple concept [01:26] anytime we're trying to teach a dog a [01:27] new behavior we have to make sure that [01:29] we can get the dog to do the behavior [01:31] with the physical cue first before we [01:33] put it on any sort of verbal command [01:35] so what i'm going to do for this as you [01:37] can see the bell is hollow [01:39] all we need to do is place food [01:40] underneath the bell and wait for our dog [01:42] to do the correct behavior [01:44] which is ringing the bell so let's see [01:45] how this goes first i'm going to give [01:47] her one [01:49] then i'm going to show her and put it [01:51] under the bell [01:55] and we can encourage them to yes good [01:58] girl so even though she tapped with her [01:59] nose that's good [02:00] i just want any sound of the bell [02:05] get it girl good girl yes good girl [02:08] very good [02:11] all right shift shift there we go [02:21] she knows the food's underneath good [02:23] girl go ahead [02:24] you can encourage them come on get it [02:26] already yes [02:28] very nice good job [02:33] good yes good so again i don't mind if [02:36] it's her nose or her paw i just want her [02:38] to ring it [02:43] good girl good girl [02:46] you can do it go ahead come on [02:52] come on good girl [02:57] so she's trying to dig [03:04] good girl come on [03:16] come on [03:23] so that's her trying to offer up a [03:24] behavior to get the reward but it has to [03:26] be ringing the bell [03:27] and she has a high enough level of [03:29] perseverance [03:31] that she'll continue to work to try to [03:32] get the reward come on ari [03:35] yes good so i rewarded even though the [03:38] bell didn't ring [03:39] because she was putting in an active [03:41] effort to get it [03:48] come on are you up [03:52] that one she pawed off i'm gonna get her [03:55] to back up a little bit down [03:57] good break [04:04] yes good girl very good [04:20] yes good girl very good [04:23] so now i'm gonna try to please act like [04:25] i'm gonna place a treat underneath [04:27] to get her to try to ring the bell so [04:29] i'm gonna get her back up [04:30] a little magic trick bring her into the [04:32] down position act like i put it under [04:34] so now it's not under but she thinks it [04:36] is [04:38] good girl good girl good no [04:42] come on okay no she figured out that i [04:43] had it over here [04:47] and she's very very high drive good [04:51] see if you can get it yes good girl [04:54] excellent [04:57] wow [05:04] all right [05:11] so that's normal they try to dig [05:13] underneath [05:14] we have to get them to understand it's [05:16] the act of ringing the bell back it up [05:20] so i need to make sure i hold it a [05:21] little more snug [05:24] come on yes good girl very nice [05:28] down good i'm gonna change the angle a [05:32] little bit for you guys [05:38] yes very good ari good job [05:47] you can do it yes good girl [05:53] yes very good [06:00] come on yes good girl [06:05] yes very good ari [06:09] so now i'm rewarding her for ringing the [06:11] bell and the reward is coming [06:14] yes good because she's already figured [06:16] out what i want her to do [06:20] yes a little excited on that one yes [06:24] good girl very good [06:28] good one yes good girl [06:33] excellent we're gonna do a couple more [06:35] and that's it climb [06:38] move your butt [06:41] yes very good all done [06:52] good [06:56] yes good yes [06:59] very good yes good girl [07:06] yes excellent yes good girl [07:13] yes good girl very nice [07:16] yes good yes [07:20] good girl yes [07:23] ex [07:29] hang on is this [07:32] hey [07:39] yes good girl [07:45] so now if if we want to add the command [07:48] all we have to do is say command and [07:51] then present the bell the bell is [07:53] actually the physical cue at this point [07:57] down down [08:05] all right so now we want to give it a [08:07] command so i'm going to say the command [08:09] then i'm going to present the bell once [08:11] she does the behavior i will mark in [08:12] reward so it should look something like [08:14] this [08:16] bell [08:20] just don't drop it yes good girl [08:24] again i put it away i bring it out i go [08:37] yes good i'm trying to make sure she [08:39] actually rings [08:41] brings the bell yes good girl [08:45] yes good bill [08:48] yes good girl very good belle [08:52] belt yes belle [08:56] yes [08:57] [Music] [09:01] belle yes very good belle [09:05] yes excellent and down [09:08] sit down [09:12] break [09:15] bell yes [09:18] bell yes belle [09:22] yes belle yes [09:26] good girl belle

different sessions and ari [10:05] figures it out pretty quickly she's a [10:07] very very [10:07] intelligent very motivated dog now i've [10:10] done this with three dogs total the [10:12] other two did not learn it quite as fast [10:14] as ari did [10:15] so keep this in mind when you are [10:17] working with your dogs if your dog [10:18] doesn't have as much motivation or [10:20] perseverance [10:21] that maybe ari does it's going to take a [10:23] little bit longer but just be patient [10:25] with it and you will be able to get your [10:26] dog to do this behavior [10:28] all right

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 78/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode today we are back at the tom [00:03] rose school for professional dog [00:05] trainers [00:05] this is part two of the training series [00:08] that tom and i put together around seven [00:10] years ago [00:10] so i want to thank tom for giving me the [00:12] opportunity to share these training [00:14] videos with you guys [00:15] on my channel so let's go ahead and jump [00:17] right in [00:18] [Music] [00:20] this next exercise we like to call the [00:22] climb command we have learned here that [00:24] people that utilize the climb command [00:26] end up doing better [00:28] with the training than the ones that [00:29] don't because they end up being more [00:31] consistent [00:32] kind of like what we mentioned before [00:34] dogs can't multitask so if we give them [00:35] a responsibility they can't do bad [00:37] behaviors [00:38] that you don't want them to do so if i'm [00:40] utilizing a climb command [00:42] my dog can no longer chew on the [00:43] furniture they can no longer running up [00:45] and down the stairs barking at the [00:46] neighbor's dog [00:48] they can no longer jump on people who [00:49] are coming over to the house they can no [00:51] longer beg at the dinner table [00:53] you pretty much get the point i'm able [00:54] to put the dog on the climb [00:56] and they're no longer able to do all [00:57] those bad behaviors that once was a [00:59] problem [01:00] ah so the way that i teach the climb [01:02] command is i simply [01:03] walk the dog over to the climb once they [01:06] jump [01:06] up willingly i'm gonna mark and reward [01:09] and i'm simply gonna walk the dog over [01:11] with food [01:12] and guide him yes once he goes up on the [01:15] position i mark and feed [01:17] break now some dogs might [01:20] not do it as willingly or as easy as [01:22] he's doing it so what you're going to [01:24] end up doing [01:24] you might have to walk on it with them [01:26] yes but once they make that decision to [01:29] go up [01:29] on it then you're going to mark and feed [01:32] i've seen some dogs where [01:33] they'll avoid it and all i do at that [01:36] point [01:37] is i help the dog as much as i can dogs [01:40] end up getting better [01:41] the more successful they are so if i [01:43] have a dog that's really struggling and [01:44] really worrying about it or [01:46] they just can't figure it out i might [01:47] help push their rear end up [01:49] or i might help guide them up by picking [01:50] them up i'm going to show them [01:52] exactly what it is that i want i'm going [01:54] to paint that clear picture once i get [01:55] in the position [01:56] yes and then feed mark and feed and [01:59] that's [01:59] laying the dog no that's what i want so [02:01] now that the dog understands by walking [02:03] over to it i want him to climb on it [02:05] then i put it again on a verbal cue so [02:07] break [02:08] so i stand next to it and i say climb [02:11] and then i show the dog [02:12] yes feed break [02:18] climb yes so i said climb [02:22] then i point because that's what i did [02:24] to guide him over to it [02:25] then i mark and feed break and what you [02:28] could do [02:30] climb yes to make this more fun for the [02:34] dog is you can set up multiple climbs [02:36] and you can have them jump around from [02:37] one climb to the next while pointing to [02:40] it and this is [02:40] part of the reason why we do the [02:42] sendouts [02:44] uh that you see in some of the other [02:45] videos is it teaches the dog to follow [02:47] your hand in which direction you point [02:49] so here's an example i'm going to show [02:50] you how i utilize that in order to send [02:53] him to different climbs [02:54] okay this next exercise is going to [02:56] speed up my climb command and it's also [02:58] going to help [02:59] with directing so i'm going to guide him [03:00] to each different client once he gets to [03:02] that climb [03:03] then i'm going to mark with my release [03:04] marker which is free [03:07] and then i'm going to send him to [03:09] another client by pointing to it [03:11] second he gets on there release marker [03:13] he's going to come access [03:14] so he's going to learn the faster he [03:16] gets to each different obstacle [03:18] or each different climb command the [03:19] faster he gets released and gets access [03:21] as a reward [03:22] free climb [03:27] free good movie free [03:32] climb free [03:36] climb catchy climb free [03:39] good movie climb [03:45] woo free good boy climb [03:48] this is a really fun exercise and it [03:50] gets the dogs to enjoy the climb command [03:52] and to have fun with it and the same [03:53] time teaching them something [03:56] once your dog is starting to understand [03:58] the heel position a little bit more [04:00] uh you've done the backwards follow [04:01] exercise you've done random sits and [04:03] downs and the dog's really starting to [04:05] understand that game [04:06] what we can do is we can implement our [04:07] sits and downs while we heal [04:10] and this is called a sin motion or down [04:11] in motion the first time i do this [04:14] exercise [04:14] i'm going to want to lure the dog into [04:16] the position after i give the command [04:18] and then as the dog progresses i'm going [04:19] to give the command and turn into him [04:21] to make sure that he's doing it and then [04:23] i can release him and then as the dog [04:25] progresses i'm going to use a mirror [04:27] we got mirrors in this training building [04:29] if you guys don't you can set up a [04:30] mirror in the house or whatever [04:31] so then that way i can walk towards the [04:33] mirror i can give the command when the [04:34] dog goes in the position [04:35] i can see it in the mirror then i can [04:37] release him and give him the reward so [04:38] first i'm going to demonstrate [04:40] uh the emotions with luring the dog into [04:43] the position you'll notice [04:44] once a dog gets into the position i mark [04:46] and then i deliver the reward [04:48] apache [04:53] heel sit [04:57] yes [05:01] heel [05:09] down yes [05:15] free once a dog is doing that nicely [05:19] then you can transition to where you [05:20] simply give the command and turn and [05:22] watch them to make sure that they do it [05:26] heal sit [05:30] free once they get in the position i [05:32] release him [05:33] and i give him his reward [05:39] heel down [05:45] free fetchy goodbye buddy [05:50] and then once again final step is i [05:52] utilize a mirror [05:54] i walk towards the mirror so i can see [05:55] it i give the command once it gets in [05:57] position [05:57] i release and reward heal [06:02] sit so right there you notice he did not [06:06] do it [06:07] at that point i know he's not ready for [06:08] that so i simply go back [06:11] to luring him into the position or [06:12] turning into him [06:14] heel [06:18] sit yes [06:21] heel and it's no big deal the dog [06:24] doesn't do something [06:25] i'm not going to stress out about it i [06:26] want it to be fun and he just doesn't [06:28] know it yet [06:29] so i go back a step heel down [06:34] freak good boy good boy buddy [06:39] betchy [06:42] good boy sit [06:47] free good job buddy [06:51] yes [06:58] down free good boy [07:03] good job [07:09] sit back [07:12] sit free all right [07:16] fine so if you noticed on that last one [07:20] i gave one command he did the opposite [07:22] and i said bad so [07:23] bad was my non-reinforcement marker he [07:26] was actively trying to do [07:28] the command he simply did the wrong one [07:30] he made a mistake so i wasn't going to [07:31] correct him for that [07:32] i recommended he did the correct one i [07:35] marked and rewarded [07:36] so that's just going to boost his [07:37] confidence so he's going to be more [07:38] successful in the next one [07:40] remember we always want to boost the [07:41] dog's confidence these should be fun [07:42] exercises and you're gonna end up having [07:44] better performance from your dog [07:49] so if you're having trouble with your [07:51] dog's recall command it's not as fast as [07:52] you would like it to be [07:54] the dog's moving a little slow they [07:55] don't seem as motivated about it [07:57] what i like to do to speed this exercise [07:59] up is i will give the dog the recall [08:02] command [08:02] once a dog makes the decision to start [08:04] coming to me then i use his release [08:06] marker [08:07] so he comes and acts as a reward and [08:09] i'll do this randomly [08:10] as i'm training so the dog doesn't have [08:12] to necessarily come in and finish the uh [08:15] the the recall command with the sit [08:17] front and everything i'll just release [08:19] them halfway through [08:20] or right as he starts to really speed [08:22] him up because what ends up happening [08:24] is the dog is anticipating or predicting [08:26] a reward [08:27] so they end up going faster so i just [08:29] mix this in with my training [08:35] come free good boy good boy buddy [08:41] sit no sit good [08:53] come free [08:57] good boy [09:01] this next exercise is called figure [09:03] eight this really shows that your dog [09:05] understands healing more [09:07] and those of you that just want a [09:09] well-trained pet [09:10] this isn't going to be something that [09:11] you're really going to worry about but [09:13] if you want to take it up to the next [09:14] level [09:15] and eventually maybe reach competitive [09:17] level type obedience this is in some of [09:19] your competitive obedience out there [09:21] and it's called a figure eight so i'm [09:23] going to [09:24] get my dog next to me in the heel [09:26] position and then i'm going to walk [09:28] around these two cones now at first i [09:31] start with cones [09:32] it's less of a distraction it's an [09:34] object [09:35] as the dog understands the exercise a [09:38] little bit more [09:38] i'm going to add people so in the [09:41] beginning stages i'm going to use a lot [09:43] of food [09:43] to lure the dog and guide the dog where [09:45] i want because when you go [09:47] left around the cone the dog has to slow [09:49] down when you go [09:50] around right the dog has to speed up and [09:53] you'll see what i mean by this and how [09:54] the dog has to change pace [09:55] and i help him out with food as he [09:57] progresses and you do a lot of this [09:59] we just take the food away slowly and [10:01] deliver the rewards [10:02] less frequently but still when he's [10:04] doing it properly apache [10:06] heal [10:12] heal [10:17] so right now he's basically just eating [10:19] and walking the whole time [10:21] so you see he speeds up right there [10:24] and slows down right here once he starts [10:27] to understand it i could pull the food [10:29] up [10:29] yes reward patchy [10:35] yes good boy [10:41] yes so i marked that because he's sped [10:44] up [10:48] yes [10:52] down and this is one of those exercises [10:55] break that you have to just do a lot of [10:58] them [10:58] to get the dog comfortable and to get [10:59] them understand it it's a physical [11:01] challenge for the dogs [11:02] so they need practice at it and they're [11:04] not going to get a good edit if you [11:05] don't do it so [11:06] this is one of those that you really [11:07] just have to go through the motions do [11:09] it a lot of times [11:10] and mark and reward properly if my dog [11:12] is going slow [11:13] or they're having issues what i like to [11:15] do is i speed them up with the food [11:18] or i'll run away from them and when i [11:20] run away from them i don't even correct [11:21] them [11:21] i just run away and what happens it [11:23] kicks in their prey drive [11:24] so if i'm going around this way and he [11:26] starts to lag i'm just gonna run [11:28] and once he catches up i'll reward him [11:30] uh and then what i'll do [11:32] is i'll mark and then i'll yes and i'll [11:34] bring the food way over to the side [11:36] so you notice he's right next to me yes [11:39] and i bring it over here [11:40] so then he speeds up around to get to [11:42] the reward [11:43] yes and that's going to help him [11:47] understand that he needs to go faster [11:49] around the turn [11:54] and once again with this one i'm just [11:55] gonna use the food and really just [11:57] guide them and help them to understand [12:00] it if my dog is struggling [12:02] on that what i'm gonna do to make it a [12:03] little bit easier is i'm just gonna go [12:05] wider [12:06] i'm gonna start really really wide and [12:09] as the dog gets better [12:10] i'm going to start tightening it up so a [12:13] wider circle [12:14] is much much easier for the dog and then [12:17] once again as they get better [12:18] i'm going to utilize that just keep [12:21] getting [12:22] a tighter circle to where the dog can [12:24] understand it [12:27] okay so we received a few emails uh [12:29] people requesting on [12:31] how to get their dog to walk backwards [12:33] or to understand to walk backwards in [12:35] heel position [12:36] what i first do with this is i'm going [12:38] to teach the dog to walk backwards with [12:40] food [12:40] and i'm going to demonstrate with my dog [12:42] and then after the dog understands [12:44] that they can physically walk backwards [12:46] to access a reward [12:47] then i'm going to utilize one or two [12:50] methods to teach him to walk backwards [12:52] on command [12:53] if he's doing really well with the food [12:54] i could just use that or [12:56] we can utilize the leash pressure which [12:58] we learned in one of the other videos [13:00] where all i'm going to do is apply a [13:01] little bit of back pressure once my dog [13:03] walks back i'm going to mark and feed [13:05] so first i'm gonna show you with just [13:06] the food patchy [13:08] so i'm gonna bring dog no commands i'm [13:10] just getting the dog dude i'm gonna push [13:11] back into him [13:13] yes once he walks backward i'm gonna [13:16] mark and feed [13:17] yes so now it looks like he's eating the [13:19] whole time but he doesn't actually get [13:20] the food until [13:21] i give him his marker [13:26] yes so he's understanding to walk [13:29] backwards [13:30] yes and now what i do to teach it after [13:33] he understands [13:34] that is i say whatever i want my command [13:36] to be so this one i'm gonna call it [13:38] moonwalk [13:39] so i'm gonna say moonwalk yes [13:44] moonwalk yes [13:49] moonwalk yes see once again predictive [13:53] nope [13:54] sit moonwalk [13:58] yes now if you're having trouble what [14:00] you can also do apache [14:01] is you can utilize a wall so bring them [14:03] over to the wall [14:05] and i'm going to do the same thing i'm [14:06] just going to use the wall to keep them [14:08] from spinning [14:09] mark and feed [14:12] brick now the next technique that you [14:15] can utilize is the leash pressure [14:18] so i take the leash after the dog [14:21] already understands the concept of going [14:23] with the leash [14:24] i'm just gonna get the dog next to me [14:26] once again still no commands [14:27] he's just having fun right now [14:34] good boy [14:40] yes and now i pull back [14:44] yes he walks backwards with it pull back [14:46] on the leash [14:48] i'm gonna guide him into the position [14:51] yes [14:52] so right there he's swung a little bit [14:53] around on the side but i'm not too [14:54] worried about that i'm not worried about [14:55] precision at this point [14:56] just doing low pressure yes he walks [14:59] backwards [15:00] i mark and feed yes [15:05] yes good boy and this should not be [15:08] stressful for the dog [15:10] you should already understand to go [15:13] with the leash before you do this [15:15] exercise and you should already [15:17] understand [15:19] the ability that he has to walk [15:20] backwards uh now what happens with some [15:22] dogs [15:23] is they'll hunker down or they'll sit [15:25] when you go to do this you just [15:26] uh basically what what uh we've seen [15:28] success with is moving forward and then [15:30] back again [15:31] moving forward and back again once a dog [15:33] moves back mark [15:34] and reward and this is going to help get [15:37] it to where you can have your dog in [15:38] heal position you can walk backwards [15:40] and he'll walk backwards with you and [15:42] this is also [15:43] the step in teaching your left about [15:45] turns so walk backwards [15:47] and he's going to walk back with me once [15:49] again he understands [15:52] the pressure and that's what i use i [15:53] just pulled back and walked yes [15:55] and the dog gets in he goes with it i [15:57] mark and feed [15:59] we've had a couple emails with people [16:01] asking us how to teach [16:03] a left about turn and a left about turn [16:05] is where you're walking [16:06] forward you go to turn around the dog [16:08] swings back around [16:09] into position and continues to walk [16:11] forward this is called a left about turn [16:13] the way that we teach it is just like [16:16] with anything else [16:17] we build the dog up on success so the [16:20] more the dog is successful [16:22] the better they're going to be so the [16:24] first thing that i do after the dog [16:25] understands heel they they should be [16:27] pretty good at the heel position [16:29] is i'm going to do a spiral i'm [16:31] basically going to walk in a circle [16:32] and my circle is going to get smaller [16:34] and smaller and smaller and i'm going to [16:36] be going left in this circle so my dog's [16:38] going to be in the heel [16:38] and i'm going to be walking around like [16:40] this it's going to start as a big circle [16:42] and it's going to get smaller and [16:43] smaller and smaller up into the point [16:45] where it's almost doing a left about [16:46] turn [16:47] once the dog is getting pretty fluent at [16:49] that [16:50] then i'm going to do left turns around a [16:54] cone [16:54] so i'm going to take a cone i'm going to [16:56] set it up [16:58] and i'm going to heal towards the cone [17:01] and i'm going to walk around it so [17:04] that's after the spiral so first i have [17:06] the dog and i'll walk like this [17:08] big spiral yes and as [17:12] the dog understands it it gets smaller [17:15] and smaller [17:21] yes to where they're really starting to [17:23] understand that comp set [17:24] after that i'm going to start with the [17:27] dog [17:28] again walking around the cone i'm going [17:30] to do a lot of repetitions like this [17:33] i want to be able to do that fluently [17:35] patchy climb [17:38] i want to be able to do that fluently [17:40] before i actually go into the straight [17:42] left about turn [17:43] and a left about turn is going to be on [17:44] the same line [17:46] so if i'm walking up and down the line [17:48] on the floor [17:49] i turn around i'm back on that line and [17:52] the way i'm going to do that [17:53] if i utilize leash pressure this is what [17:56] i'm going to utilize for this [17:58] technique i'm going to have the leash [17:59] behind my back [18:01] so it's going to be hooked to the dog [18:02] it's going to go around and i'm going to [18:03] have it in the back [18:04] i'm going to be walking marking and [18:06] rewarding and as i come to the position [18:08] to let's about turn [18:09] i'm going to do a little bit of pressure [18:10] as i turn around the dog is going to [18:12] feel that pressure [18:13] and they're simply going to swing around [18:14] with me and i'm going to demonstrate [18:16] with apache [18:17] okay so i have apache here and i'm going [18:19] to demonstrate that left about turn [18:21] using the leash so i have the leash [18:23] behind my back [18:25] and i'm going to start healing with them [18:26] heel i'm gonna do a right about turn [18:29] here [18:30] now coming back [18:36] yes so you saw as i turned right there [18:40] he felt the pressure on the leash and he [18:42] swung around with it [18:46] yes and i'm doing it really slow and [18:48] making it easy for the dog so he's [18:50] successful [18:51] this shouldn't be stressful once again [18:52] for the dog [18:55] yes so he has to understand that he [18:57] needs to walk backwards with it [18:59] and once again he feels that tiny bit of [19:00] pressure because we taught the least [19:02] pressure correctly [19:03] and i walk around yes and then as that [19:07] becomes fluent [19:08] then we can speed it up good boy buddy [19:11] come on buddy [19:15] yes [19:23] yes and this is a young pup so sit [19:29] down the more you do it the more fluent [19:32] they're gonna become and the better and [19:34] sharper it's gonna be [19:35] but i'm gonna make it easy and i'm gonna [19:36] let the dog be successful with it this [19:38] is really going to help you teach your [19:39] left about turns [19:40] free another common question we have is [19:44] how to teach a stay [19:46] so i'm going to demonstrate that the [19:48] first position i like to teach us to [19:49] stay is going to be your climb command [19:51] after my dog has a reliable stay on the [19:53] climb command then i'm going to [19:54] transition that to a sit stay [19:56] down say stay stand stay whatever it is [19:58] that you want [19:59] now with this being said i do not use [20:03] the word [20:04] stay so if you think of every single [20:06] command that we teach our dogs [20:08] we require that the dog performs some [20:11] sort of action [20:12] so sit down come heal all these require [20:15] that the dog performs an [20:17] action when you say stay stay it [20:20] confuses a dog because it's not [20:22] predicting some sort of action or some [20:24] sort of requirement it just it doesn't [20:26] make sense [20:26] in a dog's mind so what we do is once [20:29] the dog is in a position [20:30] the dog must maintain that position [20:33] until given [20:34] up or i'm sorry the dog must maintain [20:36] that position until giving a new [20:38] position or follow command [20:39] or until released from that position so [20:42] if i tell my dog to sit down [20:44] climb whatever they have to maintain [20:46] that position until released [20:48] so the first one i'm going to [20:49] demonstrate is the climb now when i'm [20:50] doing this i want to give my dog [20:52] feedback i want to let the dog [20:53] know that he's doing the behavior that i [20:56] want without releasing them from the [20:57] behavior [20:58] so i'm going to use my continuation [20:59] marker i'm going to come back and i'm [21:01] going to deliver [21:02] the reward to him each and every time so [21:04] at this point i'm saying don't worry [21:05] about getting up if you stay there i'm [21:06] going to keep rewarding you [21:08] and i build on that with distance so if [21:10] i'm walking i'm far away from my dog [21:12] and my dog breaks the downstairs sit [21:15] stay climb stay whatever [21:16] i simply say no i casually walk back to [21:19] the dog [21:20] i give the dog a correction and then i [21:22] put him back on the climb command or put [21:23] him back in the sit position whatever [21:25] and then i mark and reward i don't run [21:27] at the dog i don't do all that crazy [21:28] stuff [21:29] because what happens when we run at our [21:30] dog really quick it creates a stressful [21:33] situation in the dog's mind [21:35] and they're no longer learning at that [21:36] point so my condition punisher is [21:38] no i'm going to say just like that so he [21:41] jumps [21:42] no i walk to him i give him a correction [21:44] put him back on the climb [21:45] yes reward if i'm using a remote [21:47] training collar when my dog jumps off i [21:49] say no [21:50] i do the correction on the remote [21:51] training collar i guide the dog back on [21:54] the climb [21:54] i mark and reward so i'm going to [21:56] demonstrate with apache [21:57] free climb [22:03] so and i'm not i don't correct something [22:05] like that if they jump on it and [22:07] accidentally fall off [22:08] so he's on the position i'm watching him [22:10] if he breaks it [22:11] i'll use my condition punisher and i'll [22:13] give him correction i'll put him back on [22:15] if not i'm gonna build his confidence by [22:18] marking rewarding [22:19] yes so as i walk away [22:23] yes then i come back and feed so i say [22:26] the yes [22:27] before i turn back to give the reward of [22:30] the dog [22:30] so it's not this yes [22:34] because if i do that then this [22:37] becomes a cue and no longer my marker [22:40] sound so my markers sound must come [22:42] before any new direction in movement so [22:45] i'm walking this way [22:47] yes i go back give a reward and [22:50] of course in the early stages we want to [22:51] watch the dog so i'm walking away i'm [22:53] watching them [22:53] yes come back in reward [22:57] yes and i always see what the dogs will [22:59] do [23:01] by uh proofing them so i'm gonna make [23:03] sure there's no pressure on the leash [23:05] when i do this because i taught him [23:06] least pressure [23:07] so by pulling he should come with me but [23:09] i'm gonna hold the legion i'm gonna walk [23:10] to the end of it and i'm gonna drop it [23:11] and then i'm gonna mark and reward him [23:13] if he stays on [23:15] yes [23:20] yes so it's showing them just because i [23:22] have a leash and it looks like we're [23:24] going for a walk [23:25] yes if i didn't give you that command [23:27] you should stay there and i'm going to [23:29] come back and i'm going to deliver a [23:30] reward they start getting good at it [23:31] i'll run [23:34] yes [23:41] and i'll keep doing different exercises [23:43] like that in order [23:44] to teach this day if you were to break [23:47] the position once again no [23:48] correction guide them back up yes reward [23:52] and this is going to be the same with [23:53] your down and your sit and your stand [23:56] whatever it is so if i pull them off [23:58] they're free [24:00] and i bring them over here and i put [24:01] them betchy [24:03] and i'm not giving him any commands just [24:05] get him in the position now once he's in [24:06] position yes [24:08] feed [24:12] now again he has to stay there until i [24:13] release him [24:17] yes if you go to give him the reward and [24:21] the butt comes up [24:22] i withhold the reward bud goes back down [24:25] then i give him his reward [24:27] yes no [24:31] yes [24:36] yes and as they get better i'm going to [24:39] take a little bit longer before i mark [24:41] and reward down [24:43] yes same thing with the down at first i [24:45] build the distance [24:47] yes go back and feed [24:50] and uh with this as well i can grab the [24:52] leash act like i'm going for a walk [24:54] drop it yes reward down [24:58] climb and this is really going to help [25:02] make it clear in the dog's mind what it [25:04] is that you want with them without any [25:06] sort of conflict without having to go [25:08] stay because that really just confuses [25:11] dogs [25:11] so we make a really clear picture for [25:13] the dog to understand it and by doing [25:14] this [25:15] you're going to get a really solid stay [25:17] i hope you guys enjoyed today's video [25:19] please let me know you

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 81/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:02] hey everybody welcome back to another [00:04] episode today we are going to be [00:05] teaching our dogs not to pull on a leash [00:08] the first thing we want to do is we want [00:09] to make sure our dogs understand the [00:11] concept of leash pressure [00:12] or it's really a leash cue because what [00:14] we're doing is we're teaching our dog to [00:16] go with the pressure on the leash [00:18] so i have a martingale on cash here cash [00:21] really likes to pull on the leash [00:23] also assuming your dog has already been [00:25] conditioned to the marker so your [00:27] continuation marker and the terminal [00:28] marker [00:29] all i'm going to do is i'm going to [00:31] apply pressure when he responds to it [00:33] i'm going to mark and then i'm going to [00:35] reward it's very simple [00:36] if i need to help him i could use the [00:39] food [00:40] to help lure him into the position i'm [00:42] trying to get him into [00:44] while using the leash pressure so you'll [00:45] see what i mean by that here in a second [00:47] so the first one i'm going to pull this [00:49] way there's the pressure [00:51] now i'm going to use the food to help [00:52] get him to understand the concept of [00:54] going with the pressure [00:55] so i'm going to show him the food cash [00:57] he comes towards the food i release the [00:59] pressure [01:00] same thing if i lift up then i lift the [01:02] food he sits i turn the pressure off [01:05] i give him the food i guide him onto the [01:07] climb platform [01:08] i help him with the food he gets on yes [01:12] reward same thing with the up one i lift [01:15] up there's the pressure [01:17] he sits we turn the pressure off when [01:19] you're doing leash pressure training the [01:21] most [01:21] important thing to to pay attention to [01:24] is the pressure on the leash [01:26] this is a form of communicating to our [01:28] dogs so we want to make sure once the [01:30] pressure is turned on [01:31] it cannot be turned off until they [01:32] comply and the moment they comply you [01:34] have to turn the pressure off [01:36] every time i do lessons with people and [01:38] i'm teaching them how to use the leash [01:40] and to use leash pressure [01:41] i always find myself saying turn the [01:43] pressure off turn the pressure off turn [01:45] the pressure off turn the pressure off [01:46] because the dog goes into position and [01:48] they keep the pressure on [01:49] so you have to really pay attention to [01:51] that pressure to make sure the moment [01:54] the dog complies [01:55] boom that pressure's turned off because [01:56] the dog has to know it's the act of [01:58] complying [01:59] that's turning off the pressure so i'm [02:01] gonna lift up again boom he sits [02:02] i give him the food and this is the [02:04] first time i've done leash pressure with [02:05] this dog [02:06] he's just very food motivated so this [02:08] really helps out by [02:10] turning the pressure on and then again [02:13] showing him the food [02:14] he sits i turn the pressure off now even [02:16] if we're doing the down position i pull [02:18] down on the leash [02:19] he lays down i turn the pressure off [02:21] that was way more compliant than i was [02:22] expecting [02:25] and i have a whole video dedicated to [02:27] just doing this exercise with your dog [02:30] all right we're gonna lift up again boom [02:32] he's set another thing i like to do is i [02:34] like to use my foot so i pick my foot up [02:36] i apply pressure [02:37] this is consistent pressure it's not [02:40] beautiful so he goes into position i [02:42] turn off the pressure and i reward him [02:44] so what i'm saying is it's con [02:45] consistent pressure i start the pressure [02:47] and it's consistent i'm not [02:48] pulling on i'm not bouncing up and down [02:51] it's just a consistent [02:52] pressure and it's not so hard that [02:54] you're choking your dog [02:56] it should be they feel the pressure they [02:58] comply boom [02:59] we turn the pressure off and we can even [03:01] give them a reward [03:02] so we're using a combination of positive [03:05] reinforcement [03:06] and negative reinforcement so this is [03:08] incredibly powerful [03:10] it's a technique that works so well with [03:12] dogs that it can really speed up your [03:14] training process [03:15] and your ability to communicate clearly [03:17] with your dog so again we're going to [03:18] guide him this way [03:20] yes he's figuring this out so fast [03:23] labs tend to be pretty smart dogs but [03:26] again you see that pressure [03:27] once i start boom yes [03:30] and here's another key note to keep in [03:32] mind we don't have to go [03:34] right into the pressure meaning if he's [03:36] paying attention to me [03:37] for example if i go to lift up my leg [03:40] and he goes to lay down before he even [03:41] feels the pressure [03:43] that's really what we want so we want to [03:45] move [03:46] very slowly at first so the dog has an [03:49] opportunity [03:50] to predict what we're going to do so for [03:52] this as an example [03:53] i slowly start to walk up the leash boom [03:55] he does the behavior [03:57] i mark in reward meaning i didn't just [03:59] go right into boom doing pressure very [04:01] quickly that's another common mistake a [04:03] lot of people make [04:04] so let's guide them back this way yes [04:06] very good buddy [04:07] guide them off yes excellent my little [04:10] man lift [04:11] up on the leash yes very good [04:14] and we'll do the pressure down as well [04:16] whoa [04:17] gotta keep our balance and now i'm gonna [04:19] help him out with the food [04:22] yes good job this is something you want [04:26] to keep in mind [04:28] whatever comes first is what you're [04:30] teaching your dog [04:31] whatever comes after whatever comes [04:34] first [04:34] is helping the dog understand what comes [04:37] first [04:38] so what i mean by that is in this [04:39] situation we are starting the leash [04:41] pressure [04:42] first so anything that comes after the [04:44] leash pressure is reinforcing the [04:46] learning process [04:48] for the dog to understand leash pressure [04:51] right now what i'm doing is i'm using [04:53] food to help him [04:54] understand this so once i start the [04:56] pressure i use the food [04:58] once he goes into the position i release [05:00] and reward [05:01] let's say for example your dog already [05:03] knows the verbal command down [05:05] and you want to teach him leash pressure [05:07] what you could do is you can start the [05:09] pressure [05:10] the dog feels the pressure then you [05:12] simply say down [05:14] your dog lays down and you turn off the [05:16] pressure [05:17] so even though you told your dog down [05:20] what came first was the pressure [05:22] so then it becomes a pattern the dog [05:24] starts to learn and they start to [05:25] understand they go every time i feel the [05:27] pressure [05:28] you're going to command me into that [05:29] position so i'm just going to do it [05:31] anyways [05:32] so just keep this in mind this is really [05:33] about understanding that concept [05:35] of the science behind dog training so [05:38] we're just gonna do a couple more yes [05:41] good job buddy [05:44] leg comes up nice and slow boom there's [05:46] the pressure [05:48] let's see if he'll do it without the [05:50] help yes [05:52] and he did because he's a good boy [05:54] aren't you cash [05:55] again slowly start to lift up boom he [05:58] does it [05:59] we mark in reward remember dog training [06:02] is [06:02] all about clear communication the more [06:05] clear we are with [06:06] our expectations the much easier your [06:09] your training process is going to be [06:10] with your pup so [06:11] i'm going to do this a little bit more [06:13] with him i want him to be [06:14] really really responsive to that [06:17] pressure which he's [06:18] almost there he's at about 80 percent [06:20] right now i want to make sure i get him [06:22] to 100 [06:23] then we're gonna jump into the next step [06:25] towards teaching our dogs [06:26] how to walk on a loose leash [06:31] okay guys this next step is another fun [06:34] simple step all we're going to be doing [06:35] is [06:36] we're going to guide our dog into the [06:37] heel position we want to give them a [06:39] basic idea and understanding of how to [06:41] find that heel position when we're [06:42] taking them out on a walk [06:44] if you want your dog on the right side [06:45] you're going to do exactly what i'm [06:46] doing you're just going to put them on [06:47] the right [06:47] instead of the left so when i'm doing uh [06:50] with the food [06:51] i'm just going to use the luring hey [06:53] focus where we're training buddy [06:54] and i'm going to guide them around [06:55] stepping back with my left foot bringing [06:57] them into heel position [06:58] and rewarding good boy same thing i'm [07:01] going to use the leash to do it i'm [07:02] going to guide them around get them in [07:03] the heel position [07:04] mark and reward i have a video all on [07:07] teaching a dog to get into this position [07:09] but this is something that's going to [07:11] help when we take our dogs out for that [07:12] loose leash walking so again [07:14] when we're using the food we step back [07:16] with the left leg we guide our dog [07:18] around once they're in position we mark [07:19] in reward [07:20] when we're using the leash very very [07:23] similar we step [07:24] back we guide with the leash whoa buddy [07:27] and then when they get back in the heel [07:29] position we mark and reward [07:31] so i'm going to do a couple just playing [07:33] around having some fun [07:34] showing you guys what it would look like [07:36] when you're working training with your [07:37] dog [07:37] it doesn't have to be super serious and [07:39] structured we want to have a good time [07:41] so if i'm just doing food i'm guiding [07:43] him into position boom i'm rewarding him [07:45] then i'm taking off oh bringing him back [07:47] in the heel position [07:49] mark and reward again i'm not worried [07:50] about precision [07:52] i just want him to have a good time [07:54] finding that heel position [07:57] so again when we're out on the walk he's [07:58] gonna look for that on his own [08:01] and it's nice to do it with the leash as [08:02] well so when he feels that pressure [08:04] boom he knows how to get into the [08:06] correct position oh that was sloppy [08:08] got him around and again we want to do [08:12] this a bunch of times so [08:14] take the time to teach your dog how to [08:16] find that heel position [08:17] and make it fun make it very engaging [08:19] let your dog have a good time [08:21] this is going to transition over and [08:23] make that loose leash walk that much [08:24] easier [08:25] let's get to the next step [08:30] the next portion of the training is [08:31] really simple and it's a lot of fun [08:33] we're going to place a harness on our [08:34] dogs and we're going to allow them [08:36] to pull and explore their environment [08:39] this is a very important step in the [08:40] training process [08:42] because if we take our dogs out the very [08:44] first time and we expect them to walk [08:46] nicely on a loose leash there's going to [08:48] be more of a battle because you're going [08:50] to be competing [08:51] up against all these other distractions [08:53] within the environment [08:54] so we want to go out there we want to [08:56] let our dogs pull we want to let them [08:58] get that out of their system so then the [09:00] obedience portion of the training is [09:02] going to be that much [09:03] easier [09:07] all right now that we've given him some [09:09] time to explore the neighborhood [09:10] what i'm going to be doing in this step [09:12] is simply getting him to respond [09:15] to the leash pressure now that we're in [09:17] the front and we're walking around the [09:19] neighborhood [09:19] so i have the harness in case he does [09:21] try to pull but the goal is i want him [09:23] to respond [09:24] to the pressure that i place on the [09:27] leash that's attached to his collar [09:29] so i'm gonna start to pull a little bit [09:30] once he responds and turns my way [09:32] i'm gonna mark and reward free [09:36] good boy very good and again all i want [09:40] him to do is to respond to the pressure [09:42] on the leash so i pull [09:44] free good and i'm using his terminal [09:48] marker [09:51] free good job buddy [09:55] very good [10:00] and so now you can already see he's very [10:02] focused on me he's had a time to explore [10:04] the neighborhood [10:05] so now it's not this crazy new exciting [10:08] thing that's one of the biggest [10:09] issues that people run into they start [10:11] to work with their dog then they take [10:12] their dog out into an environment with a [10:14] ton of distractions [10:15] and then they wonder why their dog's not [10:17] listening we have to build the dog up so [10:19] by [10:20] exposing them to the environment giving [10:22] them an opportunity to see it [10:23] is going to make it to where it's not so [10:25] exciting that they're going crazy when [10:27] you're trying to do the training and [10:29] it's going to make this part [10:30] much easier so again all we're doing on [10:33] this part is we're out in front [10:34] and we're just getting them to respond [10:36] to the pressure on the leash once he [10:38] responds [10:39] we mark and reward good boy [10:43] free good and he's kind of fine in the [10:46] heel position now on his own which is [10:48] excellent [10:50] so during this step your main goal is to [10:52] get your dog to respond to the pressure [10:54] on the leash and to get the focus from [10:56] your dog [10:57] once you do that we're gonna take this [10:58] skill on an actual walk so let's go [11:01] ahead and do that right now [11:02] all right now we got cash here and we're [11:03] ready to take him on a walk i'm gonna [11:05] say [11:05] heal then i'm going to step if he starts [11:08] to pull i'm going to stop him with the [11:09] harness first [11:10] then i'm going to use the leash pressure [11:12] to guide him back into the correct [11:13] position [11:14] this is especially helpful for those [11:16] dogs that really like to pull [11:18] because it's going to help prevent them [11:19] from pulling too hard on their neck [11:21] so we're using the harness again to stop [11:23] them from moving forward [11:24] then we use the leash pressure with the [11:26] collar to guide them back into the [11:27] correct position [11:28] then we mark and reward make sure the [11:31] pressure on the harness starts first [11:33] we're actually teaching them that the [11:34] pressure from the harness is going to [11:36] predict the pressure from the collar [11:38] so eventually the dog is going to [11:39] respond on just the harness alone [11:41] so if you wanted to continue to walk [11:43] your dog on a harness and not a collar [11:45] you'd be able to do that [11:46] after teaching him this technique so [11:48] again we're going to bring him back into [11:49] the heel position [11:50] good boy tell him to sit and then we're [11:53] going to say heal [11:54] and off we go again if he goes ahead of [11:56] me [11:57] which he's not doing yet he's doing well [12:01] stop him with the harness bring him back [12:03] good boy [12:06] and then he's back in position so now [12:07] i'm going to demonstrate just how it's [12:09] going to look if i was out here training [12:11] him by myself so keep in mind [12:13] the details that i was explaining [12:14] earlier so we're going to walk [12:20] free good boy buddy nice job very good [12:26] if he's not paying attention i'm also [12:28] going to sneak out of heel position [12:29] there's the pressure good [12:31] good boy very nice so you can see this [12:35] doesn't create any sort of stress [12:37] it's a very easy very comfortable walk [12:39] for the dog there's the pressure up [12:41] see now he's already responding to just [12:44] the pressure on the harness [12:45] and that's really what i want to see [12:47] while i'm doing this step [12:51] if you don't want sit [12:54] so what this is doing it's actually [12:56] teaching him not to pull [12:58] while he has a harness on and again i [13:00] use this technique for dogs that really [13:02] pull a lot and pull very hard [13:04] because i don't want them to choke [13:05] themselves however if you want your dog [13:08] to pull on a harness let's say you're [13:09] exercising your dog [13:10] or you're running your dog whatever and [13:12] you want to pull then [13:14] you don't want to do this because it's [13:15] actually teaching him not to pull [13:17] even with the harness so if you [13:20] want your dog to pull when they have a [13:22] harness then you're going to do this [13:23] exact same step but you're just going to [13:25] use the collar [13:26] you're not going to use the harness the [13:27] way that i'm using it alright so let's [13:29] go right back into it heel [13:31] and then we step good boy buddy [13:34] good boy [13:39] yes good job my little man and if he's [13:43] doing well if he's maintaining position [13:46] yes i can mark and reward them right [13:48] here good [13:53] very good buddy very good yes [13:59] good job [14:04] sit yes and the nice thing is [14:08] if you teach your dog leash pressure [14:10] when you take your dog on a walk you can [14:11] start implementing basic obedience as [14:13] well [14:14] so i could even tell him to down [14:17] then do the q with the leash pressure [14:28] yes [14:31] no so he broke the position so i said [14:34] one no [14:35] use the leash pressure put him back in [14:36] the position [14:42] no [14:45] good boy sit yes [14:48] nice job and then we're going to step [14:50] right back out on the walk [14:54] hey up here heel then we step [14:57] good boy very good [15:03] and if he's doing well again we can huh [15:06] oh good job you got me buddy that's what [15:10] i want i want the dog to [15:11] to catch me trying to sneak out of the [15:13] heel position [15:14] we always want to make training fun and [15:16] we want to make it a game yes [15:18] good boy [15:22] so again both are nice and loose [15:26] good boy [15:30] oh he sees a birdie good boy buddy [15:34] once he realized he wasn't able to get [15:35] to the bird he knew he had to respond to [15:37] the leash pressure [15:38] so he turned around and went back into [15:40] the correct position [15:42] if you go to apply pressure and your dog [15:45] doesn't turn around [15:47] then you can correct for that meaning [15:51] if i pull on the leash and he's not [15:52] responding to it i could say [15:54] no pop the leash and then apply the [15:56] leash pressure again [15:58] he doesn't really need that so i'm not [15:59] doing that we got a cat up ahead so i'm [16:01] curious if he's going to respond to the [16:03] cat [16:03] all right here we go heel and then we [16:05] step again making sure we say heel [16:07] before we step [16:09] if he goes ahead the pressure on the [16:10] harness first good [16:12] boy bring him back in the heel and then [16:15] we go back into the walk [16:17] excellent nice job buddy very good [16:20] so there we go and bring them back all [16:23] right [16:24] yes good boy [16:28] very good that's it [16:36] heel [16:44] good boy excellent work buddy [16:51] good again he's responding with just the [16:53] harness now at this point [16:55] sit good job down [17:02] yes [17:07] no so he broke the position so one no [17:12] and then i place him back into the [17:16] position [17:18] and so he's distracted right now it's [17:20] just a matter of waiting them out [17:21] a lot of times if the dog doesn't do [17:23] what the person wants right away [17:24] then they get excited or they start [17:26] repeating the command or they get [17:27] frustrated [17:28] you just wait them out sit and then we [17:30] bring them back up [17:34] heel and then we step good boy so even [17:37] with those distractions he still did [17:38] pretty good [17:39] here's the pressure on the harness good [17:40] and we bring him back all right nice job [17:43] excellent all right so we're going to [17:45] keep doing this for maybe another [17:48] 5 to 10 minutes and then i'm going to [17:50] switch to the next step [17:57] now that he's been doing a really nice [17:58] job walking on a loose leash with the [18:00] assistance of the harness [18:02] now i'm ready for the next step we could [18:03] take the harness off entirely [18:05] i'm not too worried about that right now [18:07] basically i'm going to be doing exactly [18:09] what i was doing before but now i'm just [18:11] going to be using the leash [18:12] with the martingale collar when he [18:15] starts to go ahead of me [18:17] we have two options we can say their [18:19] condition correction [18:21] so a no like i was using earlier when he [18:23] broke the down stay [18:24] or we can recommand the position we [18:26] would like the dog to be in [18:28] so he goes ahead of us we can say heal [18:30] and we can bring him back [18:31] praise and reward him or he goes ahead [18:33] of us and we can say no or [18:35] uh or phooey or wrong and bring him back [18:38] whatever you want to do it really [18:39] doesn't matter [18:40] to the dog because it's literally the [18:43] exact same thing to the dog [18:44] we're saying a word then we're [18:46] reinforcing what we're expecting our dog [18:48] to do [18:48] so pick and choose which one you feel [18:50] most comfortable with and go from there [18:52] what i'm going to be doing with him is [18:54] i'm going to be saying no i'm going to [18:55] keep it nice and simple [18:56] all right so we're going to start and [18:57] we're going to say heal and then we're [18:59] going to step [19:00] if he's doing well good boy nice job yes [19:03] mark and reward and again this is right [19:06] after walking him [19:08] with the harness good and [19:11] yes when they look up at me i like to [19:13] mark and reward that [19:15] if they get distracted oh i got you [19:19] i make it a game well i'm gonna get you [19:21] again very nice [19:23] buddy yes we always like i said i can't [19:26] stress it enough we always want to make [19:27] it fun [19:28] and interesting for our dogs so he's [19:30] doing very well if he looks up at me [19:33] yes i can help him out by making some [19:35] silly noises but that's just showing him [19:37] hey if you look at me [19:38] i'm gonna pay you for it and if they [19:40] look at us [19:42] they're less likely to fall out of heel [19:45] position [19:47] oh i got you again and he's a goofy lap [19:51] puppy [19:52] good boy yes and like i said the nice [19:55] thing about implementing leash pressure [19:57] is [19:57] while we're on a walk with our dog good [20:01] yes we can start implementing commands [20:04] every time i take a dog on a walk i [20:05] don't just take the dog on the walk [20:07] i like to reinforce everything that i've [20:09] been teaching the dog while at home [20:11] sit so we can use the sit we can keep [20:13] them in a sit stay if we want [20:15] we can call them to us so i can go come [20:18] bring them to me [20:19] sit that wasn't the best come but we'll [20:22] take it [20:24] he'll step back off on the walk good job [20:27] so [20:27] it's not just me walking on my phone [20:29] talking to my friend not paying [20:31] attention to my dog [20:32] we're actually hanging out together [20:33] we're communicating with one another [20:35] and we're working together on the same [20:37] team you're starting to go ahead [20:38] oh he got me before i even applied the [20:41] pressure [20:42] and that's what we want we wanted to [20:43] start noticing [20:45] if we sneak out of heel position good [20:48] yes [20:49] excellent nice job buddy very good [20:54] and so like i said he's already doing no [20:56] good [20:57] boy so i'm going to start adding that no [21:00] i haven't been doing that [21:02] no then we good and he's responding to [21:05] just the no [21:07] excellent in order for your dog to [21:09] respond to the no you have to make sure [21:11] that no [21:12] comes before you apply pressure [21:15] excellent work cash [21:17] very nice so you can see how loose the [21:20] leash is [21:21] another common mistake that people make [21:22] is the dog will start to go forward [21:25] slowly and the human keeps walking [21:27] forward [21:28] the moment i notice the dog is not [21:30] paying attention to me no [21:31] i walk out of their heel position i say [21:34] no [21:35] then i reinforce what i'm asking the dog [21:37] to do and again we have to make sure [21:40] our no comes before we apply the [21:42] pressure [21:43] no so there we go i said the no i bring [21:46] him back [21:47] and you see when i say no he's not [21:48] worried that i'm saying the word no [21:51] because he doesn't know what no means [21:53] in the dictionary he doesn't have a [21:54] dictionary that he's looking at it just [21:56] means [21:57] whatever it predicts so in this [22:00] situation [22:01] the no predicts no me going yeah come on [22:05] buddy [22:05] right back here so it doesn't mean [22:07] anything bad to him [22:09] sit good boy very nice [22:14] heel and then we step so you can see [22:17] just by working with him and [22:20] communicating to him clearly [22:22] we're able to show them what we want no [22:25] and what we expect from him without [22:27] creating any sort of conflict [22:29] or avoidance it's a very easy simple way [22:32] to teach our dogs [22:34] so again they go ahead no then we apply [22:36] the pressure we bring them back come on [22:38] buddy you gotta itch [22:39] you got it itchy and then we go right [22:41] back into the walk [22:44] if you have a dog that sit [22:47] continues to go ahead and you've done [22:49] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of [22:51] these [22:51] and he continues to go ahead and pull [22:54] you can give your dog a [22:55] leash pop or a correction for going [22:57] ahead so [22:59] i'm going to show you example of what it [23:01] would look like and the correction level [23:03] will change [23:04] according to the dog so some dogs may [23:06] need a slightly higher correction some [23:08] dogs [23:09] a lower correction so i'm going to [23:11] demonstrate with him and he's [23:12] a very compliant dog so this isn't [23:14] really going to be a correction [23:16] but i just want you to see what i mean [23:18] heal and then we step [23:20] so if he goes ahead i go no pop and then [23:23] i bring him back good boy [23:24] so you see it's a little snap gives the [23:26] dog a quick correction [23:28] then we go right back into the walk and [23:29] we're having a good time sit [23:32] good job buddy heel [23:35] the main thing is make sure you guys are [23:37] patient with this one it could take a [23:38] lot of reps [23:39] and you may find yourself walking with [23:41] your dog on the harness [23:43] for a week or so before transitioning to [23:45] just the leash it's really going to [23:46] depend on your timing [23:48] and of course the level of compliancy [23:50] and intelligence [23:51] and motivation that your dog has [23:54] remember the science [23:55] is always the same what varies between [23:58] each dogs [23:59] are going to be things like their [24:00] intelligence and their motivation their [24:01] temperament their disposition [24:03] and that's where the art of dog training [24:05] comes in i hope you guys enjoyed today's [24:07] video please let me know you think about [24:08] it in the comments below [24:10] of course as always hit that

The levels of your dog’s training experience There are several variable factors during your dog’s socializing process. This includes the levels of the task, levels of obedience, levels of proficiency, and the intensity of the environment (which includes training your dog’s social skills). Without being aware of these guidelines, you could be in for a lot of problems during training. For example: Don't ask for an advanced task from a dog that is still at a lower proficiency level in a highly intense environment. You would be setting yourself up for failure. On the flip side, if you’ve just started your training, starting on a low obedience level in a low-key environment, using beginner tasks, makes a lot of sense. Dogs, like humans, gradually become more proficient at what they are trying to learn. Starting out, and when working with a dog who’s new to training, it’s usually necessary to begin at a first stage of obedience. In time, a dog may graduate to a full obedience level, able to perform a wide variety of tasks. The road to get there is going to be faster or much slower depending on the individual characteristics of the dog. Likewise, it’s possible to grade a dog’s proficiency during obedience training. How long for a dog to become highly proficient may depend on your dog’s level of perseverance."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 84/841,"The process of socializing (and desensitizing a dog) could mean first taking the dog to a park in the early morning without many other dogs or people around. Later, as you increase in intensity, you might return to that park in the afternoon on a Sunday with lots of other people and dogs around. The goal is for the dog to behave the same way in either situation. Generalization This is the concept that the dog knows that a command applies in any situation. This is where the dog’s proficiency in the training and desensitization really comes into play. A dog that has generalization ability knows to “sit” whether at home, in a busy dog park, in a shopping mall, a park with squirrels, you get the idea. A dog that is less well-trained may only sit at home, but once exposed to a new environment the training goes out the window. This is what we seek to avoid happening, by training our dogs in multiple environments. A superstar dog will sit obediently and perform necessary tasks in virtually any situation.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 85/841,com/channel/UCTlS0hcLw5MdIxTEc9lZRVA === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everybody welcome back to another [00:02] episode i'm really excited because today [00:04] we're going to be talking about [00:05] how to properly socialize your dogs i'm [00:07] here today with dee dee from dog tag [00:09] buddies [00:10] and they train service dogs for our [00:12] veterans now she's going to be [00:13] explaining to you guys the process that [00:15] she does and how they make sure they set [00:17] their dogs up for success [00:18] as well as their veterans so when we [00:21] talk about socialization i think most [00:22] people interpret that as i'm gonna take [00:24] my puppy out and i'm gonna have [00:25] everybody touch my puppy and i'm gonna [00:27] let my puppy play with all the other [00:28] dogs [00:29] in reality that's not what socialization [00:31] is for us [00:32] what that means is we're exposing the [00:34] dog to a variety of different situations [00:37] of flooring material of people of any [00:40] kind of [00:41] novel situation that the dog might be [00:43] experiencing as they train to be a [00:44] service dog [00:46] it's really important that these dogs [00:47] get comfortable in any environment so [00:49] that they can do the [00:50] obedience and the tasks that they're [00:52] trained to do [00:53] with their veteran in mind if they [00:56] aren't focused on their veteran then [00:57] they're really not doing the job that [00:58] they're trained to do so i think that's [01:00] that's where we go when we start talking [01:01] about socialization definitely and what [01:03] are [01:04] some of the training exercises that your [01:07] trainers or even yourself what you do [01:09] with the dog to help prepare them [01:11] to be with the veteran or what are some [01:12] of the things that you have the veterans [01:14] do with their dogs [01:15] in order to get them more comfortable [01:17] being in these environments [01:18] while still making sure the obedience is [01:20] there and the dog is doing the tasks [01:22] that are necessary for that veteran both [01:25] as the train as trainers when we have [01:27] the dogs and when the dogs are paired [01:29] with their veterans taking the dogs out [01:30] to places that are pet friendly [01:32] so we have a lot of local stores here in [01:33] montana that allow pets so we have [01:35] you know ranch supply stores we have [01:37] hardware stores we have hunting and [01:40] fishing stores so they can take those [01:41] dogs out to those different environments [01:43] and sometimes it's just [01:44] it's as slow as taking the dog out of [01:46] the vehicle walking them through the [01:47] parking lot and putting them back in the [01:49] car [01:50] it's not a full on let's go shopping [01:52] because a lot of dogs are not ready for [01:54] that up front so making sure that we're [01:55] doing it in a slow [01:57] calculated manner so that we don't [01:58] traumatize these dogs before they even [02:00] start the process [02:01] by doing too much too fast and we were [02:04] talking a little bit earlier about [02:06] one of the biggest problems that [02:08] veterans or anybody who has a service [02:10] dog and they're going out in public [02:12] is everybody wants to go up and pet a [02:15] service dog [02:16] and when we have a service dog and we're [02:18] working with it either as a trainer or [02:19] as the person with a disability [02:21] we have to tell somebody like no i'm [02:22] sorry the dog is currently working [02:25] and a lot of times people don't really [02:26] understand why why can't i pet that [02:28] service dog it's so cute it's a dog it's [02:30] meant to be pet [02:31] well there are reasons for this and i [02:33] really love the way that you explained [02:34] earlier [02:35] and how you tell children why it's [02:38] important not to pet somebody's service [02:39] dog so i'd love if you can explain that [02:41] to the audience as well [02:42] so when i go and do presentations to [02:44] little kids little kids seem to [02:45] understand it [02:46] when we talk about people with service [02:48] dogs we may not know why that individual [02:50] has that service dog but one of the [02:52] things that you have to be aware of is [02:53] if i'm disturbing this dog and the [02:56] handler is standing there and maybe they [02:57] have a seizure disorder [02:59] if they start to have a seizure and that [03:00] dog can't focus on the handler [03:02] they could potentially have a seizure [03:04] and fall and hit their head we're [03:05] talking about a life and death situation [03:07] here so [03:08] it's not fair for me to interrupt that [03:09] dog that dog has a job to do [03:11] and little kids seem to understand that [03:13] concept when you tell them hey [03:15] this dog is working and here's what can [03:17] happen it's a lot easier to explain it [03:19] to them and then they go explain it to [03:20] their parents and their parents go oh [03:22] i get it so it's kind of that aha moment [03:24] and it comes through the children which [03:25] i really like [03:26] it's funny that you say that because [03:28] when i do basic just dog training [03:29] lessons with a family [03:31] some reason the children always do way [03:33] better than the adults do [03:35] and i have to reassure everyone it's [03:36] normal the kids just pick up the [03:37] information for some reason much faster [03:39] and they're able to start applying it [03:40] right away but yeah and that's very [03:42] important when a dog is out a service [03:44] dog is working [03:45] their responsibility has to be on the [03:47] person with a disability [03:48] they can't be distracted by everything [03:50] else going on and that's [03:52] why that socialization and exposure to [03:55] new environments and new distractions [03:57] is so important in the training process [03:59] now there's a simple training plan we [04:01] like to follow when socializing our dogs [04:03] and it's the same process that i use [04:05] whether i'm training a service dog [04:07] or the family pet there's a few [04:09] variables that you want to keep in mind [04:10] during your dog socializing process [04:13] this includes the levels of the tasks [04:15] levels of obedience [04:16] levels of proficiency and the intensity [04:19] of the environment [04:20] which includes training your dog's [04:21] social skills for your convenience i [04:23] place this entire breakdown in the [04:25] description of the video and if you [04:26] follow this simple process [04:28] you'll be able to train your dog to [04:29] behave with other dogs and humans [04:31] as well as responding to your commands [04:34] in all environments [04:35] yep i would agree all right thanks [04:37] everybody for watching today [04:39] thank you

REALLY! Anything). The distance is measured to where the base of the dog’s tail enters the water. CATCH IT - The dog must catch the bumper twice in a row. The distance of the catch is added to the distance of the landing. FETCH IT - The bumper is suspend four feet above the water. The dog must knock the bumper from the apparatus - it is not necessary to grab the bumper - just knocking it off counts as a successful jump. The current record is 29 feet EXTREME VERTICAL - The bumper is suspended ever higher above the water and dogs jump straight up to knock the bumper from the apparatus.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 89/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:05] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:07] episode today i'm here at phd canines [00:09] and ph dogs [00:10] we're going to be doing some doc diving [00:12] with a doc diving group [00:14] they're going to be breaking down the [00:15] step-by-step process that they like to [00:16] go through [00:17] when they're teaching a new dog this [00:19] process as well as what they do when [00:20] they're problem solving it should be a [00:22] lot of fun [00:23] i'm really excited and i'm sure you guys [00:25] are gonna like it so let's jump right in [00:27] good morning it's john colorado here [00:28] we're at the ph dogs dock diving [00:30] facility in riverside california [00:33] and we're going to show one of the first [00:35] stages we do [00:36] in teaching our dogs doc dive is getting [00:39] in and out of the pool that's one of the [00:40] most important things to do [00:42] so we have amber and chamaco here today [00:45] this morning [00:46] and we're going to do a little bit of [00:47] ramp work so after your dog does the [00:49] dive [00:50] they have to get in and out using this [00:51] ramp so we're going to show how we work [00:53] that so chamaco [00:55] we're just going to throw the toy in let [00:56] chamaco go after it nice and gently and [00:59] come right back up out the ramp so [01:00] they're going to throw the bumper in [01:01] first [01:03] there we go and then chamacho's going to [01:05] go retrieve that [01:10] attaboy [01:13] you can see chamacho is normally used to [01:15] coming out on the other side [01:16] so we're going to train him he's got to [01:18] look for the other ramp on the other [01:19] side [01:22] that a boy good boy so that's very [01:25] important because [01:26] different facilities have the ramps on [01:28] one side different [01:29] facilities have the ramp on the other [01:31] side so you just want to make sure your [01:32] dog knows how to get out [01:33] you never want them to be fearful in the [01:35] water and this gives them the [01:36] self-confidence and the knowledge of how [01:38] to get in and out of the pool we're [01:40] going to try that one again [01:45] here here here [01:53] there he goes he's getting it he's [01:54] getting it now [01:58] so you see we're having to lure him less [02:00] and less [02:02] as he learns where what side the ramp is [02:04] on so now that we have chamaco [02:06] understanding how to get out of the pool [02:08] we're going to go ahead and do a regular [02:09] dock dive so amber is going to throw the [02:11] toy [02:12] and chamacho's going to go catch the toy [02:14] and retrieve it up the ramp so here [02:16] comes amber and chamaco [02:27] so now we have linda and her australian [02:29] cattle dog [02:30] ruby they're gonna they're a little more [02:32] experienced getting in and out of the [02:33] pool so we're gonna show this [02:34] ramp work again as ruby's going to come [02:36] down retrieve a toy and get up and down [02:38] the ramp [02:44] there she goes this dog is very [02:46] comfortable in the water no problems [02:48] there [02:52] so now that ruby is very comfortable [02:54] getting out of the pool [02:55] knowing where the ramp is we're going to [02:57] go ahead and do some dives here's uh [02:59] ruby one of the champions of the country [03:01] right here number one [03:03] cattle dog [03:07] that looks nice yeah that's a big [03:09] jumping dog [03:22] so now we have charlie here and uh [03:25] sometimes uh if dogs can't find [03:27] the ramp or are hesitant to get out [03:29] we'll put a nice long leash this is a 25 [03:31] foot leash [03:32] i'm going to send her in and we're going [03:33] to help her find the ramp and reopen it [03:35] here we go [03:36] go get it just give a little gentle tug [03:40] just so she knows the ramps on this side [03:41] of the pool [03:42] and here she comes here she comes good [03:46] girl good girl charlie now that we've [03:49] shown charlie how to safely get out of [03:51] the pool [03:51] we're going to go ahead

[01:16] my belgian malinois first we want to get [01:18] them conditioned to the furbo so they [01:20] love the sound [01:21] because that sound is going to be [01:23] predicting a reward [01:24] once you get your furbo set up you're [01:26] going to want to download the app it's [01:27] very simple just go to the app store [01:29] find the furbo app and download it [01:31] once you get it on you're going to sign [01:32] up and it's really simple you can see [01:34] right now i have it turned on [01:36] you can see my dog's hanging out nicely [01:38] getting ready to do some dog training [01:40] if you follow my dog training videos [01:42] you'll know one of the big things that i [01:43] always like to implement [01:45] is the concept of marker training this [01:47] is when we make a certain sound [01:48] predict a reward also known as classical [01:51] conditioning [01:51] so what we're going to do is we are [01:53] going to classically condition [01:54] our dogs to the sound that the furbo [01:57] makes prior to it releasing [01:59] the reward and what's really nice about [02:00] the furbo is the sound comes [02:02] before the delivery of the reward this [02:04] is very important in order for a dog to [02:06] become classically conditioned [02:07] the sound must precede the delivery of [02:10] the reward [02:10] and that's exactly what the furbo does [02:13] so what i'm going to do at the very [02:14] beginning [02:15] to get my dog conditioned i'm going to [02:17] stand next to the furbo [02:18] i'm going to release a treat when it [02:20] makes the sound i'm going to [02:22] toss a treat as well as allowing the [02:24] furbo to shoot out a treat [02:26] then my dogs are going to have an [02:27] opportunity to get the treats get [02:29] conditioned [02:30] and we can use it for training all right [02:32] so what we're going to do is [02:33] i have the furbo i'm going to press the [02:35] button and then i'm going to toss the [02:37] treats so here we go [02:43] and then boop and we toss the treats and [02:46] now they can come over and get access to [02:47] them [02:48] so you can see my dog ari she was a [02:49] little cautious at first that's fine [02:51] we're going to start getting her to [02:52] understand that that sound means a [02:53] reward [02:54] charlie's already ready to rock and roll [02:56] this dog loves food and i'm going to let [02:58] ari do her thing and she wants to come [02:59] get a reward she can all right here we [03:01] go we're going to send the first treat [03:08] you can see he heard the sound turned [03:09] around and got access to the reward [03:11] here we go let's send another one [03:16] look at that focus oh and he's trying to [03:19] take it right out of the furbo [03:28] there he goes he's trying to catch it [03:29] too perfect [03:31] so he's already conditioned to it he [03:33] loves the sound he knows it's gonna [03:35] shoot a treat [03:35] and he's excited every time it goes off [03:38] not only is the furbo dog camera [03:40] excellent for keeping an eye on your [03:41] dogs when you're away and working on [03:43] some of that separation anxiety [03:44] but it's also an excellent tool when [03:46] you're training something i often talk [03:47] about is reward placement [03:49] reward placement is very important when [03:51] we're doing any sort of precision style [03:53] obedience [03:54] so what the furbo pet allows us to do is [03:56] to [03:57] train our dogs and when they do [03:58] something correctly we can reward them [04:00] and release them to go get the reward [04:02] from the furbo pet [04:03] so let me show you how it's done so i'm [04:05] just gonna do some basic training with [04:06] charlie [04:07] i'm gonna put them in position then i'm [04:09] gonna tell them free [04:10] and i'm gonna release the treat [04:17] and this is the first time i've done [04:18] this with him so it's gonna take him a [04:20] second to realize [04:21] that the reward is coming from the furbo [04:22] pet so i'm gonna bring him back in the [04:24] heel position [04:25] i'm using luring i'm gonna tell him to [04:27] spin [04:28] and then free [04:31] [Music] [04:34] and then he goes and gets his treats [04:36] like i said he's a little slow with it [04:38] down free so again i release right there [04:41] now he's waiting for the rewards to come [04:43] from me so [04:44] it's gonna take him a second [04:47] to realize that the treat's gonna come [04:49] from over there after i use his terminal [04:51] marker so free for him [04:53] means release and reward so when i say [04:55] it he can go get access to his reward [04:57] and i'm gonna treat the furbo the sound [04:59] that it's making as a terminal marker [05:01] so charlie's gonna start to understand [05:03] that this furbo that sound means [05:05] release and reward something else i [05:07] highly recommend that everybody should [05:08] do with their dogs is an exercise known [05:10] as free shaping [05:11] this is when we don't have anything in [05:13] mind we want our dogs to perform but [05:14] when they do something that we like [05:16] we mark and reward now the furbo dog [05:19] camera can really help us facilitate [05:21] this [05:21] not only can it help us do this when [05:23] we're at home with our dogs [05:24] but it can also help us do this when [05:26] we're not at home [05:28] and our dog is doing behaviors that we [05:29] like we can capture that moment [05:31] by using the treat dispenser in our [05:33] furbo pet so let's say for example your [05:35] dog sits and looks up at you [05:37] you can go ahead and hit the furbo pet [05:39] to reward that behavior [05:41] and the nice thing is we always have our [05:43] cell phones on us so you always have [05:45] that opportunity [05:46] to reward your dog the moment they do [05:48] something that you like [05:49] and this is going to help create that [05:51] proactive dog the dog that understands [05:53] that their behavior [05:54] has an effect on their environment and [05:55] they can make rewards happen [05:57] so when you tell your dog to do a sit or [05:59] a down your dog is going to be more [06:01] likely to do that behavior [06:02] because you can always make a reward [06:04] magically appear [06:06] i also like to use this when i'm working [06:07] on separation anxiety [06:09] or proper house manners when we're crate [06:12] training our dogs we crate training for [06:14] two reasons potty training [06:15] and house training and when your dog [06:17] graduates from that step [06:18] and you want to start leaving your dog [06:20] inside of the house out of their crate [06:22] when you're not home this really helps [06:24] us make sure our dogs are behaving [06:26] properly [06:27] when we're not home so we're going to [06:28] step outside and we're going to watch my [06:30] dogs on the verbal camera [06:35] now i'm outside of the house and i have [06:37] the opportunity to watch my dogs to make [06:39] sure they're behaving [06:40] while i'm not in there and if they're [06:42] performing and they're doing things that [06:43] i like such as relaxing sleeping on the [06:45] couch these are all good behaviors [06:46] for your dog to perform when you're not [06:48] home i can press the furbo [06:50] treat release and give my dog a reward [06:52] for doing the right thing when i'm not [06:54] there [06:54] this also helps them adjust when you [06:57] start leaving the house more [06:58] by giving them something they're used to [07:00] receiving while you're at home it's an [07:02] excellent way to [07:03] increase your dog's confidence and at [07:05] the same time make them comfortable [07:07] when you're not at the house charlie is [07:09] pretty excited to get the reward [07:10] and when they're doing really well and [07:12] your dog's performing the way that you [07:13] want you can walk back inside [07:15] and reward them when we have a dog that [07:17] has separation anxiety [07:18] we don't want to leave for a long period [07:20] of time right away in the beginning [07:22] we want to start with small durations [07:24] and as our dog becomes more comfortable [07:26] we can increase that duration and using [07:29] the camera is going to help us watch our [07:30] dogs to make sure [07:32] we're not pushing the time limit too [07:34] fast too early [07:35] another feature i really love about the [07:37] furbo dog camera is the alert system [07:39] that's built in [07:40] it will let you know if your dog is [07:42] barking or whining or making excessive [07:44] noise [07:44] and then you can check your camera to [07:46] make sure your dog's not getting in any [07:48] trouble [07:48] so i'm going to demonstrate with you [07:49] guys by making ari bark for us [07:52] revere and there we go [07:55] we got an alert notification it says [07:58] barking alert your dog is barking click [08:00] to see what's going on [08:01] you can open up the furbo app and you'll [08:04] be able to see [08:05] what your dogs are up to another feature [08:07] i really like about the furbo dog camera [08:09] is the two-way audio [08:10] if you've taught your dog the verbal [08:12] commands if you teach them correctly you [08:14] can actually give them the commands [08:16] through the furbo let's give it a shot [08:17] we're gonna call charlie to the camera [08:21] charlie come [08:25] yes good boy buddy [08:28] you can see how happy he is responding [08:30] to my command through the two-way audio [08:32] let's give arya command as well [08:34] ari sit yes [08:38] good girl very nice [08:41] this is one more fun way to engage with [08:43] your dogs while you're away [08:44] verbo has many amazing features that [08:46] even allow you to train your dog [08:47] remotely such as treat tossing to reward [08:49] your dog for being well behaved at home [08:51] it also has smart alerts to notify you [08:53] when your dog is barking [08:55] two-way audio a full hd camera for [08:57] pictures and video with zooming [08:59] capabilities and even night vision [09:01] this is their biggest black friday sale [09:03] ever and you can save 46 percent [09:06] on your purchase so get over to [09:08] furbo.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 95/841,"There are three primary Dock Diving Organizations: Ultimate Air Dogs Dock Dogs North American Diving Dogs Two other Organizations include Dock Diving as part of their dog sports activities: Purina Pro Plan Incredible Dog Challenge Super Retriever Series There are four different Dock Diving Games: DISTANCE - Just get the dog to jump as far as they can using whatever toy/lure you want (bumper, ball, frisbee, shoe... REALLY! Anything). The distance is measured to where the base of the dog’s tail enters the water. CATCH IT - The dog must catch the bumper twice in a row. The distance of the catch is added to the distance of the landing. FETCH IT - The bumper is suspend four feet above the water. The dog must knock the bumper from the apparatus - it is not necessary to grab the bumper - just knocking it off counts as a successful jump. The current record is 29 feet EXTREME VERTICAL - The bumper is suspended ever higher above the water and dogs jump straight up to knock the bumper from the apparatus. DIVISIONS - The wonderful thing about Dock Diving is that every dog can participate and compete regardless of size, breed or experience. They ALL have the opportunity to become Champions. There are multiple Divisions based upon the distance that the dogs are jumping - 0'-10', 10'-15', 15'-20', 20'-25' and 25' and beyond. The current record is over 35 feet. There are also Divisions for Featherweight & Lap Dogs, Veterans (8 years of age and older), Super Veterans (10 years of age and over), Service Dogs and Junior Handlers who are under the age of 18.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 97/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back everybody to another [00:01] exciting episode we're going to be doing [00:03] some more doc diving today [00:04] with this incredible doc diving group [00:06] this is going to be the next step [00:08] in the training to teach your dog how to [00:11] properly [00:12] doc dive so let's jump right in hi my [00:14] name is tammy strassenburg and [00:16] i'm here to help with some of the [00:19] problems we're having with dogs on the [00:20] dock whether it be [00:22] refusing to jump whether it's jumping [00:24] too early [00:26] helping your dog track to get more [00:27] distance [00:29] this is my dog reese she's a [00:31] seven-year-old gsp [00:33] german shorthaired pointer and we're [00:35] going to demonstrate [00:36] now how to judge your [00:39] stride for your dog to use the entire [00:41] dock this is called a sit stay [00:44] where the dog is at the end of the dock [00:46] either held by a handler or [00:48] sitting on their own i'll call the dog [00:51] to me [00:51] and she'll track the toy and jump so we [00:54] can see what her stride is and we can [00:56] evaluate what we need to do with making [00:59] sure she's using the entire dock [01:00] ready go go go go go [01:05] so as you could see she jumped about [01:07] four feet early she wasn't using the [01:09] entire dock [01:10] which meant she could have landed four [01:12] feet farther for a little bit more [01:13] distance [01:14] so in this case there are a couple of [01:16] things that you can do [01:18] you can either move them to to track see [01:21] how many stride shoes she's got an extra [01:23] half stride [01:24] so i will probably instead of moving her [01:26] up to four feet [01:27] i'll probably move her up a foot and see [01:30] how that tracking [01:31] works for her so as you can see she's [01:33] still a little off on her stride [01:35] it could be one of two things it could [01:37] be the stride or [01:38] it could be she's watching how you're [01:40] throwing the toy and how fast you're [01:42] releasing the toy [01:43] so what we've worked on with her is it's [01:46] more of the release and where i'm [01:47] releasing the toy [01:49] so i'm going to work on my throw this [01:51] time because i believe that her stride [01:53] was correct it was just she left [01:55] when i stood up to throw the toy so as [01:57] you see she missed the toy but her drive [01:59] was to do whatever she could to catch it [02:02] that's where you get the extreme stretch [02:05] from her [02:06] and driving down the dock the speed [02:10] that was a handler error on my part on [02:12] my throw [02:13] because this dog can catch just about [02:15] anything so sometimes your dog [02:17] will jump one day and refuse to jump the [02:20] next day and sometimes you've got to [02:22] reset them [02:23] we normally do a sit stay throwing for [02:26] her [02:27] but at one point she started refusing to [02:29] go off the dock so i had to take her [02:31] back and [02:32] start doing a place and send where [02:35] i take her up on the dock put the toy in [02:38] the pool let her see the toy and let her [02:40] drive off the dock [02:41] she's not looking for me to throw the [02:42] toy so when you're doing a place and [02:44] send you want to make sure that your dog [02:46] can have visibility of the toy [02:48] from wherever you're going to pull the [02:50] back to i try not to put the toy out too [02:53] far [02:54] that way the dog doesn't feel like [02:55] they're defeated [02:57] before they ever ever start so we [02:59] usually will put the toy in at about [03:01] 10 feet [03:04] we allow the dog to see the toy and then [03:07] we take them back [03:11] just far enough to where they can still [03:14] see the toy [03:15] ready go [03:20] and it gets them to run through the dock [03:27] and helps with the refusal you can also [03:30] as you [03:31] progress move farther and farther out to [03:34] the point where [03:35] you know where your dog is typically [03:37] jumping i'll put hers out at about 22 [03:39] feet [03:44] see it i'll allow her to see the toy [03:49] rhys come [03:53] you want to make sure your dog can still [03:55] see the toy [03:56] ready go [04:02] and then once they're jumping regularly [04:05] again back into the pool without refusal [04:07] you can go back to [04:08] the sit stay and toss for your dog so [04:11] with this breed you'll notice that [04:13] it looks like she's shivering from being [04:15] cold [04:16] that's actually excitement and that's [04:18] just a clue in to how much she's excited [04:20] about the sport [04:21] so in helping my dog to track the toy [04:24] she's a natural tracker but i wasn't [04:26] getting as much distance and so i was [04:28] really wanting her to catch it every [04:30] time [04:30] so that i could drive her distance out a [04:32] little farther um i first start by [04:34] teaching them how to catch the toy [04:36] um without throwing it in the pool ready [04:40] good girl so as you see the more she [04:43] catches the toy the more excited she [04:45] gets it's actually a reward for them [04:47] so each time that she catches the toy [04:49] she's more driven [04:50] to go after the toy farther and farther [04:52] okay so as you can see [04:53] this is just three of a multitude of [04:56] problems that could be solved [04:58] when doc diving my suggestion is [05:01] find a good instructor in your area i [05:04] have taken lessons from [05:06] everyone that i can find because there's [05:08] always something positive from somebody [05:11] and that will help you and your dog get [05:13] better at the sport and [05:14] with every breed there are people who [05:16] specialize with [05:17] that breed my breed of choice is german [05:20] short hair pointer and they have their [05:22] own [05:23] issues to overcome so there isn't a one [05:27] trainer that does it all [05:28] i would say try several and and you'll [05:31] find your answers for [05:33] your problems that you're having what an [05:34] awesome episode and so much fun with [05:37] this group today i had a blast i hope [05:38] you guys had a good time as well [05:40] please leave a comment let me know

First, we started by introducing them to the pool and the ramp. Once they were comfortable going in and out of the pool we moved to the next step, which was having them jump into the pool from the dock. Finally building some distance and speed. It was no surprise that these two pups took to this sport like naturals.

There are three primary Dock Diving Organizations: Ultimate Air Dogs Dock Dogs North American Diving Dogs Two other Organizations include Dock Diving as part of their dog sports activities: Purina Pro Plan Incredible Dog Challenge Super Retriever Series There are four different Dock Diving Games: DISTANCE - Just get the dog to jump as far as they can using whatever toy/lure you want (bumper, ball, frisbee, shoe... REALLY! Anything). The distance is measured to where the base of the dog’s tail enters the water. CATCH IT - The dog must catch the bumper twice in a row. The distance of the catch is added to the distance of the landing. FETCH IT - The bumper is suspend four feet above the water. The dog must knock the bumper from the apparatus - it is not necessary to grab the bumper - just knocking it off counts as a successful jump. The current record is 29 feet EXTREME VERTICAL - The bumper is suspended ever higher above the water and dogs jump straight up to knock the bumper from the apparatus. DIVISIONS - The wonderful thing about Dock Diving is that every dog can participate and compete regardless of size, breed or experience. They ALL have the opportunity to become Champions. There are multiple Divisions based upon the distance that the dogs are jumping - 0'-10', 10'-15', 15'-20', 20'-25' and 25' and beyond. The current record is over 35 feet."

know once the dog's in there [00:30] you're not jumping in to save her [00:32] so let's go take her down to the ramp oh [00:34] so she's gonna walk down the ramp first [00:36] okay [00:39] and then should i just let her go with [00:40] the leash attached um i you can let her [00:42] go with the leash attached [00:44] and that way we'll have something to get [00:45] her out and am i just going to let her [00:47] go right now [00:48] all right and as you notice i only put [00:52] it out a couple of feet [00:53] okay go ahead and let her go [00:56] good girl go get it get it get it get it [00:58] get it get it there she goes [00:59] good girl good girl come on good come on [01:03] good girl very good girl [01:07] good so that went pretty well yeah okay [01:09] so now just do the same thing yeah [01:12] so this time throw it out just a little [01:14] bit further maybe four feet out should i [01:15] just toss it i don't have to hold her [01:16] yeah you don't have to hold her just [01:17] toss it and she'll go after it [01:20] there she goes there she goes so now [01:23] she's learning how to get in and out of [01:25] the pool safely [01:26] which is important which is the most [01:27] important come on baby out [01:30] get nice and wet yep i think this is [01:32] going to be pretty easy so if you want [01:34] to go ahead and take her leash off we're [01:36] going to we're going to [01:36] progress up to the docks and she's so [01:38] comfortable in going in [01:40] after the in the water okay so go ahead [01:42] and bring her back up come here [01:43] all right with me [01:46] so now we're just going to have her jump [01:48] so now we'll just have her jump so what [01:50] you want to do [01:50] is you want you want to talk her up are [01:52] you ready you see it what i'm gonna have [01:54] you do [01:55] is i'm gonna have you toss it out about [01:56] five feet in front of her [01:59] not too far so she can see it but she [02:01] doesn't have to go way off the dock [02:02] okay so do it right now so go ahead and [02:04] toss it off [02:08] no problem come on ari come on good girl [02:10] come on [02:11] good girl good girl come on good girl [02:14] very nice good girl we're going to do it [02:17] again just like that only we're going to [02:19] toss it out a little bit farther so that [02:20] she has to swim a little bit okay [02:22] anytime any time you're ready [02:26] oh she fell now it's not always perfect [02:30] this she's gonna love this sport [02:34] all right come all right good girl [02:36] sweetie [02:37] good girl good girl come on mimi [02:41] very good before you release her [02:44] throw the toy okay because i don't want [02:46] her to go [02:48] as you know before if you want to you [02:50] can you can hold on her collar [02:52] throw it and then release herself i like [02:53] getting used to you [02:55] having to release her and her not just [02:57] breaking and going perfect [02:58] all right come here [03:02] so just grab the collar hold her up as [03:05] long as i don't twist my hands up [03:07] and it's free [03:11] and no hesitation she did great yeah so [03:13] we could probably build a little more [03:14] distance or is it still too early we can [03:16] we can build a little more distance as [03:17] long as she's comfortable [03:19] if she starts getting a little bit [03:20] uncomfortable we'll bring her back to [03:21] what what she's most comfortable doing [03:23] hold her loosely so that when i say go [03:26] and she's wanting to go it [03:28] slips out of your hands okay okay all [03:31] righty [03:32] go and that was right off that was [03:37] wonderful that was good [03:38] she's so cute good girl [03:42] so those are your your basics to get [03:44] started and then you can build from [03:46] there [03:46] and she's a pretty fast learner though [03:48] so she is um [03:50] it's typical for this breed to be so [03:51] driven that um it's pretty easy to get [03:54] them off the dock [03:56] go go go go [04:01] she's getting a little bit of distance [04:02] she's getting some distance and then as [04:03] you progress [04:04] she'll start tracking the toy and i'll [04:06] you could throw the toy [04:07] up a little bit that way she's going to [04:10] go up after the toy when she starts [04:12] trying so this was a probably good [04:13] session for her oh my gosh this is a [04:14] wonderful session [04:15] excellent now we're gonna bring charlie [04:16] out and see how he does all right so [04:18] we're gonna start charlie off [04:20] and we're gonna introduce charlie to the [04:21] dock i mean the ramp sorry [04:24] um we're gonna take him down the ramp [04:25] and get him used to coming in and out of [04:27] the pool first [04:28] any one of these toys is fine i

All aspiring trainers understand Tom Rose’s lifelong love for dogs — they are a vocation, a calling, a passion. The school he founded is the culmination of that passion, and their students and graduates share his dedication. Over the past four decades, TRS graduated a major percentage of the foremost trainers in the world. Employers snap up at their alumni.  Those who start their own businesses succeed consistently. One very successful graduate put it this way,  “There is no other school with the experience and instructional track record of TRS. There is no other school that teaches many different training techniques, then encourages the student to choose the methods most comfortable for them."" Tom authored three major dog-training books. He won training competitions time after time with dogs he raised and trained. He pioneered and developed the celebrated Puppy Imprinting Program. He coined the phrase ""imprinting"" as it applies to dogs."

Graduation from TRS depends upon successfully accomplishing industry-recognized objectives and requirements. The Tom Rose School curriculum is proven effective in meeting and exceeding those requirements. Lectures, demonstrations and hands-on experience guide you to accomplish objectives that would take a talented trainer ten years to learn on their own. We have hundreds of graduates to prove how effective our programs are. They operate successful companies around the world, are top-level employees, they operate/teach at other schools and win championship competitions worldwide. When you compare TRS requirements for graduation, the qualifications and experience of the instructors and the time established in the industry it is clear why TRS is the only choice. It’s simple: if you want to be the best, learn from the best. If you have the desire, the passion, if you believe you have what it takes, apply today.

episode i'm here today with [00:04] tom rose from the tom rose school and [00:06] he's going to give us a little tour of [00:08] his school [00:09] and how the program's set up in order to [00:11] give new students [00:12] a successful career so thank you so much [00:15] for having me today [00:16] tom i'm really excited to be here and [00:17] i'm excited to [00:19] show my audience where my education in [00:22] the dog training world started [00:23] thank you very happy to have you here uh [00:26] behind this you see [00:27] our main training building which is the [00:29] largest [00:30] training building where we do most of [00:32] our work uh [00:33] to the right here is a smaller original [00:36] training building i spent a lot of time [00:38] in both of them yeah it's nice to have [00:40] the option to [00:41] get away from activity and get along on [00:44] your own in a [00:45] different location definitely and then [00:47] if you want to we can walk [00:48] up the stairs here so i noticed we have [00:51] students right now [00:52] working with ikt is correct yes [00:55] most are iqtvs a couple of them are [00:57] their own dogs can you tell them a [00:58] little bit about the ikt and what that [01:00] is in the program [01:01] is one of the most important things yeah [01:03] it is i feel [01:05] the ikt is very important mainly because [01:08] for most all these students when they [01:11] graduate [01:12] they're going to make most of their [01:13] money from doing ikt dogs [01:15] and ikt stands for in kennel training [01:18] and so that that's going to be their [01:20] bread and butter from there they can [01:22] branch out and do other things make [01:23] other contacts [01:24] police departments customs whomever but [01:27] the ikt is what's going to [01:29] put the vast amount of money in your [01:30] account to begin with absolutely it was [01:32] huge for me when i was coming through [01:34] the school i wish i had [01:36] more ikts because that's what gives you [01:38] the experience to not only work with a [01:40] huge variety of different dogs [01:42] but also working with clients it gave me [01:44] an opportunity to get some of those [01:45] jitters out [01:46] that you have in the very first time [01:48] first time you do a lesson you're like [01:49] everything goes blank [01:50] yeah like oh i don't know what to say [01:52] you know by the time i had my 10th in [01:54] kennel training dog i was feeling really [01:56] good i was feeling confident [01:57] and by the time i went out and i had my [01:59] own clients it already seemed like i've [02:01] been doing this for a long time even [02:02] when i was still very new [02:04] within the industry so i agree i think [02:06] it's one of the most important things [02:07] it's great to see them [02:08] working with it right now can we show [02:10] them a little bit of the requirements [02:12] and what the students in the [02:13] professional course have to do [02:15] yeah just as far as obedience you're [02:16] concerned the requirements in order to [02:18] graduate [02:19] so that's something i always talk about [02:21] to my audience [02:22] one of the things that really attracted [02:24] me to the tom rose school [02:25] was that all the requirements are based [02:28] on things that you can experience [02:30] in the real world like akc [02:33] igp tracking search and rescue [02:36] scent detection so i'd like to show that [02:38] a little bit to the audience [02:40] yeah we're we're trying to graduate a [02:43] student that's very well-rounded [02:45] depending on what they want to go to in [02:46] so [02:47] we include agility we include [02:50] ipo obedience akc obedience [02:54] we include tracking as you just [02:56] mentioned [02:57] scent detection work just [03:00] as much well-rounded as many different [03:03] subjects as we possibly can can we [03:05] take them over to the whiteboard yeah so [03:07] let's go this way guys [03:10] so this over here is a whiteboard that [03:13] shows [03:13] the requirements now this is for the [03:14] professionals right yes it is [03:17] okay so you can see up here what we got [03:20] the doghouse [03:21] so novice that's akc and then we have [03:24] novice sits and down so what does this [03:26] mean when you have the novices and downs [03:27] and the novice okay [03:29] novice would just be healing with your [03:30] dog off lead [03:32] on lead whatever is included in the [03:34] novice exercises [03:35] the sits and down is just a sit stay in [03:38] a down state for a prescribed amount of [03:39] time [03:40] and here at the school at least when i [03:43] was here [03:43] we had it separated normally when you're [03:46] competing and you're doing [03:47] an akc novice obedience routine it's all [03:49] at the same time right they do their [03:50] opinions [03:51] you do the obedience and then you go out [03:53] of the ring and you wait and then the [03:55] judge calls you back [03:56] and a group of people comes back and all [03:58] those sits and bounce at one time [04:00] and if you fail the sits and down at [04:02] actual akc [04:03] you fail everything yeah but one of the [04:05] things you do here is you separate it [04:07] especially because a lot of the students [04:09] are working with puppies that don't [04:10] maybe have the attention span that an [04:12] adult dog would have correct yes [04:14] and so we have ipo one ipo one tracking [04:18] now i know tracking's a big one because [04:19] a lot of my audience [04:21] have been posting comments asking about [04:23] some tracking [04:24] and i know one of the really big things [04:26] that put the name [04:28] tom rose on the map was you were the [04:30] first american ever [04:31] to get a perfect on an fh track yeah [04:35] originally when i learned how to [04:36] tracking nobody knew anything about it [04:38] there was no one to go to [04:40] there's no one to answer my questions it [04:42] was just pretty much unheard of there [04:44] was police departments that were doing [04:46] it [04:46] but it was very incorrectly done so i [04:49] had to learn most of it and traveling to [04:51] europe and talking different people i [04:53] had to put it together myself [04:55] but we include it in the program and it [04:57] leads of course into search and rescue [05:01] felon tracking a lot of different things [05:03] but [05:04] the main thing that i like about [05:06] tracking is it's done motivationally [05:08] so it teaches the student how to train [05:11] the dog using motivational methods [05:13] because that's about the only way they [05:15] can do it at this level [05:17] and that's what i really love about this [05:19] curriculum is you know [05:20] even when i came to the school my main [05:22] focus and what i really wanted to do was [05:25] obedience i really loved the concept of [05:28] obedience and getting a dog to want to [05:29] sit and down and go into heel position [05:31] all these cool things [05:32] and then learning you know scent [05:34] detection learning tracking learning [05:37] search and rescue it just gave me a much [05:39] better understanding [05:41] of dog training right and even though it [05:42] may not have been [05:44] specifically what i was interested in at [05:45] first it made me look at dog training in [05:48] a different way which [05:49] widened my perspective and increased my [05:52] skills i believe as a dog trainer [05:53] right so i think it's absolutely [05:56] important for that to be [05:58] on the curriculum i love it so we kind [06:00] of compare it to college and your [06:02] undergraduate work they're exposing into [06:04] accounting to mathematics to english [06:07] several different things and then you [06:09] decide what you really [06:10] want to do and you enroll in law school [06:12] or med school or whatever you want to do [06:15] so that's what this is intended to do [06:17] this kind of undergraduate level [06:18] yep and i always tell people this is [06:20] like the harvard of dog training [06:22] it's one of the best so then we have [06:25] specific odor so that's going to be [06:26] the scent detection correct right and [06:28] that would be of the student's choice [06:30] they may want to do bomb work [06:31] they might want to do narcotics they may [06:34] want to [06:35] do some other scent like birch or [06:37] something [06:38] some other particular thing that they're [06:40] interested in doing we let them [06:41] decide what they want to do for the [06:43] search and the requirements for the [06:44] scent detection that's based on [06:47] police scent detection work or where did [06:49] you get the requirements for that what [06:50] were you basing that [06:51] it came from originally from an [06:53] organization in this country that [06:55] certified narcotics dogs [06:57] and we liked their testing and the way [06:59] they scored and we kind of stayed with [07:00] that [07:01] that's awesome and so we have agility [07:04] now here's something too with the [07:05] agility a lot of the students [07:07] end up having puppies and so i remember [07:09] going to the course [07:10] we would adjust the agility to work with [07:13] a puppy so the jumps were really [07:15] then we'd do that so they're not jumping [07:17] very high everything was [07:19] worked around to uh be able to handle [07:22] puppies [07:22] which i really liked and then the [07:24] agility being able to take that and [07:26] continue working with it [07:27] for me it was a lot of fun i ended up [07:28] loving agility yeah and the dogs love it [07:30] too i mean they have so much fun doing [07:32] the agility [07:33] and then right there we have the cgc so [07:36] uh cgc [07:36] is that still 100 motivational yes [07:40] yeah so what was your intentions with [07:43] that [07:43] we wanted to give students an [07:46] opportunity [07:47] to begin with young dogs that are not [07:51] yet being subject to compulsive [07:55] motivation [07:56] so it's positively motivated he wanted [07:59] to see that they had [08:01] the patience to motivation [08:04] and train dogs to attain the cgc so [08:08] it's a lot easier than akc novice yeah [08:11] and i think it's very important like [08:13] that was a challenge for me [08:15] coming through the course but what i [08:16] really loved about the school was [08:18] it wasn't one size fits all when i came [08:21] through the instructors here were [08:22] excellent it was so great to work [08:24] directly [08:24] underneath you as well but being able to [08:26] learn all the different tools in the [08:28] industry to be educated on everything so [08:30] then [08:31] now when i have a client that comes to [08:32] me and says hey do you know how to do [08:33] this or do you know how to do that or [08:35] whatever yes i do i had an opportunity [08:38] to do [08:38] all of it here and that's the real [08:40] beauty is you give everybody the tools [08:42] to build their mansion [08:43] and you let them choose what they want [08:44] to use right which i think is important [08:46] as a professional in this industry [08:48] you have to know it all yeah and that's [08:50] what i love about the school we refer to [08:51] it as this [08:52] toolbox exactly from what she said yeah [08:54] all right and then right over here we [08:56] have tdi so that's new that wasn't here [08:58] when i was here [08:59] what is that one yeah it's therapy dog [09:01] international [09:02] and it's a little bit more difficult [09:03] than the cgc [09:05] okay and so you guys added that how [09:07] recent have you added that [09:08] when did you start that uh possibly two [09:11] years ago i believe years ago [09:12] excellent i love it and so what is the [09:14] stick jump now that was here when i came [09:16] but you know for the audience with the [09:18] stick job those are just basically [09:20] tricks that we want [09:21] motivationally trained disciplines that [09:24] dogs are trained to do and that's just [09:26] you hold the stick and the dog jumps [09:27] over it [09:28] and that's it so it might be a puppy [09:30] jumping over a stick that's four inches [09:32] off the ground or it might be [09:33] a male annoyed thick that's two feet off [09:36] the ground yeah [09:37] and speaking of puppies when a student [09:39] goes through the program [09:40] they're required to take two dogs [09:42] through correct correct do they have to [09:44] be puppies or can they be any age [09:46] no we tell them any age any breed [09:48] whatever they want to do we don't [09:49] discriminate [09:50] regardless but we've found [09:54] in the past it's much easier to do [09:56] puppies [09:57] plus one of the major aspects of the [10:00] books that i've written [10:02] is we call puppy imprinting and [10:05] it's really helpful for the student to [10:08] learn [10:09] at least with one dog how to do this [10:11] imprinting [10:12] and it's amazing what we're able to do [10:14] we're able to take a [10:15] goal and retriever puppy as an example [10:18] and do imprinting work [10:19] and have him behave much like a malinois [10:22] when he [10:23] turns a year or two year and a half of [10:24] age so it's a very important part of the [10:27] program [10:28] however it's not a requirement of the [10:30] program [10:31] so the student it's up to the student [10:34] whether or not they want to start with a [10:35] puppy [10:36] it just has to be an untrained dog yes [10:38] but yeah and when i came through i use [10:39] puppies because i want to learn that [10:41] imprinting process [10:42] which i'm grateful that i have and it's [10:44] funny i've had some comments on my [10:45] channel [10:46] where people say hey can i have or is it [10:49] really that bad if i missed the [10:50] imprinting stage and [10:51] well you could train a dog even if you [10:53] missed the imprinting stage [10:54] but it's so important if you have a [10:56] young puppy to start them right away [10:58] at eight weeks when you bring them home [11:00] right i mean that's my favorite thing i [11:01] get a brand new puppy it's like let's [11:03] start training i'm gonna show this puppy [11:05] how awesome it is to train and then by [11:07] the time you have [11:08] that year old dog they absolutely love [11:11] to train [11:11] which makes it way easier to teach them [11:13] new behaviors and building their [11:15] confidence and all that stuff so i love [11:17] it [11:17] we say that they've learned how to learn [11:20] and they're happy about it [11:21] they're not upset if you criticize them [11:24] they come back and wag their tail and [11:26] they're happy yup and that's the best [11:27] way i believe [11:28] to really train a dog is to start from [11:30] the beginning yeah and [11:32] you know it's funny too i've heard some [11:33] people say oh you shouldn't train until [11:35] they're six months of age [11:36] and when i hear that i'm like no no you [11:38] want to start the sooner the better [11:40] yeah i began doing this about 50 years [11:42] ago [11:43] and i was highly criticized they [11:46] told me you don't even think about [11:49] training until the dog was a year of age [11:50] at that point [11:52] then i went out and began beating [11:54] everybody at dog shows and winning [11:56] everything [11:57] and all of a sudden i'm doing seminars [12:00] all over the country [12:01] on how to do the puppy in printing and [12:03] that was the basis of my first book [12:05] written back in the early 1980s is it [12:08] still available no [12:10] we still have a few of them but it's [12:12] almost sold out [12:13] the one i read that i love is dog [12:15] training with the touch [12:16] yeah that's my most recent book why did [12:18] you call it dog training with the touch [12:21] it turned out that i was in europe with [12:23] one of my clients who was competing in [12:25] the doberman [12:26] national in holland and [12:29] we had been working the dog well while [12:32] went inside their [12:33] clubhouse and everybody was talking and [12:36] i couldn't understand much of what [12:37] they're saying [12:39] they want me to go out and work my dog [12:41] and i did [12:42] and they seemed fascinated i don't know [12:44] why [12:45] it's this usual training for me and [12:48] they're all talking amongst each other [12:50] and they come back in and they say we [12:52] want to ask you something [12:54] we've got a translator that i'm gonna [12:55] talk to and see if she can explain our [12:58] question [12:58] and they're asking me why didn't you [13:00] correct here and why didn't you correct [13:02] there [13:03] seemed like you're off easy on the dog [13:04] but yet the dog is really doing well [13:07] and i said yeah that's kind of the basis [13:10] of what i'm trying to accomplish [13:12] and they say the only way we can figure [13:15] to [13:15] translate the word from our language to [13:18] yours [13:18] would be your training with the touch in [13:21] other words you don't [13:22] have to put a heavy duty collar on them [13:25] and make a hard correction [13:27] you seem to be able to get your point [13:28] across without doing that [13:30] i love that that's awesome and i've seen [13:32] other trainers that have that too and i [13:33] always think about that it's like what [13:34] are they doing that's [13:36] it's so effective yeah you know and [13:37] that's awesome i love that and so the [13:39] last two we have [13:40] trick one and trick two which i actually [13:42] i love these requirements [13:44] i had so much fun when i was an [13:45] assistant instructor here seeing all the [13:48] cool tricks that the students would come [13:49] up with i had a student [13:50] when i was here that he taught his dog [13:52] to make baskets [13:53] with the basketball and all kinds of [13:55] cool things i mean some simple ones like [13:57] spin [13:58] but then other ones another student [13:59] taught their dog to point out [14:01] colors or not colors it was like written [14:03] on paper so she would hold up paper [14:05] and she'd say blue and the dog touched [14:07] the blue yeah or red and the dog touched [14:09] the red it was just written out so they [14:10] were [14:11] seeing whatever you know in order to [14:13] identify it but it was cool yeah and so [14:15] i love that and so basically they just [14:16] have to come out and they have to do it [14:18] we let them tell us what trick they want [14:20] to do as you just mentioned [14:21] and then we say okay teach the dog to do [14:23] that and we'll watch whether [14:25] maybe a skateboard it might all kinds of [14:27] crazy things [14:28] getting on a barrel and rolling a barrel [14:29] like a sale would do whatever [14:31] but just whatever they want to do and [14:33] it's again it's motivational and [14:35] and what i love about that too is it [14:36] gives the students and this is something [14:38] i [14:38] tell everybody all my audience everyone [14:41] is [14:41] when it comes to training a dog what's [14:43] really important is learning and [14:45] understanding the science [14:46] and that's something that i learned a [14:48] lot here is what is the science to dog [14:50] training what gets our dogs to do [14:51] certain behaviors how does the [14:52] motivation work [14:54] and what varies between each dog which i [14:55] often tell people that i learned from [14:57] you is [14:57] their perseverance is going to be [14:59] different and you have to adjust [15:00] according to that their intelligence is [15:01] going to be different [15:02] their motivation is going to be [15:03] different right all these things [15:05] and what's cool about the tricks is they [15:08] have to problem solve [15:09] they have to go okay how can i implement [15:11] the science that i learned [15:13] in order to get my dog to do this [15:15] behavior so [15:16] for example when i was a student i was [15:18] trying to teach my dog to smile [15:19] and so what i would do is i would say [15:21] smile and i would lift my dog's lips up [15:24] and i did it over and over and over [15:25] again no matter how many times i did it [15:26] i said smile my dog didn't smile [15:28] i'm like why isn't my dog smiling and [15:30] what was i [15:31] taught my dog to allow me to lift up the [15:34] lips so if i took my dog in [15:36] to the veterinarian i go smile and then [15:37] he'd be like okay go ahead and lift up [15:39] my lip i didn't teach the behavior [15:40] right but then i blew my dog's face and [15:43] he [15:44] bit at the air i was like i could use [15:46] that yeah so then i said smile [15:48] and i blew my dog's face and he did the [15:50] thing and before you knew it now i had a [15:51] dog doing the behavior [15:53] because i was able to problem solve and [15:54] implement the science yeah so even [15:56] though that seems like something it's [15:57] not a big deal it's just a trick [15:59] i think it's so important as far as [16:01] evolving as a dog trainer [16:02] yeah it really is really cool and this [16:04] is just the professional program guys [16:06] he also has a master course which we're [16:08] not going to jump into that right now [16:09] but that [16:10] involves advanced obedience it involves [16:13] advanced search and rescue scent [16:14] detection a few other things it's taking [16:16] all of this [16:18] going to the next level which i did and [16:19] i'm so grateful that i did that course [16:21] now over here we have the training [16:22] building which you guys saw a little bit [16:24] when we walked in [16:25] this is where you guys do the testing [16:27] for the requirements [16:29] which is something else i want to point [16:30] out and this really attracted me to your [16:32] school [16:33] was the fact that just because you come [16:34] to the school and you can memorize some [16:37] information [16:37] it doesn't mean you're going to graduate [16:39] right you have to pass the requirements [16:41] you have to prove [16:42] that you can train a dog right and [16:44] that's what i wanted as a trainer i [16:46] wanted to be able to train a dog [16:48] i wanted to step out of school and be [16:49] ready to hit the ground running and [16:51] that's what i got here [16:52] it's very hands-on we've been asked [16:55] especially [16:56] during the colbit can't we do a video [16:59] course [17:00] and we could teach a lot of the words we [17:02] could teach [17:03] behaviors and so forth but when it comes [17:05] to training it's a hands-on thing you [17:07] have to learn [17:08] how to do what you need to do with the [17:10] dog [17:11] i couldn't agree more and if you're [17:12] going to the top level where you want to [17:14] be somebody who's teaching others [17:16] it's important to have somebody like i [17:18] used to get really nervous when you were [17:20] watching me train [17:21] because i'm like oh my gosh tom rose is [17:22] watching me i don't want to mess up [17:24] but it helped me a lot because you were [17:26] able to identify mistakes i was making [17:28] right [17:28] that i wasn't able to see and it [17:30] increased my skills as a trainer [17:32] yeah and same thing with the instructors [17:33] when they're helping out the instructors [17:35] every instructor i've seen at this [17:36] school has been [17:37] i mean top tier absolutely so they do [17:40] the testing here for all the indoor [17:42] stuff such as the doghouse [17:43] novice all the obedience right things [17:46] like [17:47] ipo and tracking and search and rescue [17:50] how do you do the testing for that [17:52] it's done out at our ranch we got a 260 [17:55] acre ranch we've got several training [17:57] fields set up [17:58] so it's really nice i only acquired that [18:01] a little over 20 years ago but before [18:03] that we were depending on county parks [18:05] and so forth which never really worked [18:07] out well [18:08] and the students have full access yes [18:10] they feel which [18:11] come any time of day or night which i [18:13] loved as a student i was always down [18:15] there working in the full-size [18:16] competition shits and field that you [18:18] have [18:18] constantly tracking the dogs being out [18:20] there who doesn't love being out with [18:21] their dogs [18:22] yeah right yeah and so we have the ring [18:24] gate set up right now if you want to [18:26] turn the camera [18:27] and check this out so over there that's [18:28] where in the beginning of the program [18:31] you guys do a lot of the instructional [18:33] as far as [18:34] information this is akc rules this is [18:37] basic behavioral problems you might run [18:39] into this is dog psychology [18:41] a lot of that takes place in the first [18:42] few weeks yes we start out with a lot of [18:45] lecture [18:45] there's very well there's working but i [18:48] would say it's 80 [18:49] lecture and 20 working towards the end [18:52] of the course it's [18:53] maybe 2 lecture and ninety-eight percent [18:56] working so hands-on in here training [18:59] with the instructors constantly helping [19:01] them out overseeing what they're doing [19:03] making sure they're not making those [19:04] mistakes and [19:05] developing them as dog trainers so when [19:07] they test you guys can see there's a [19:08] bunch of climb beds out here [19:10] and that's something i tell everybody [19:11] too the climb command that i taught here [19:14] and i always know when i see another tom [19:15] rose graduate because they called the [19:17] climb command as well [19:18] yeah like oh you're a timer graduate so [19:20] climb command [19:21] excellent command teacher dogs and then [19:23] so this was set out recently because [19:25] they just finished testing this morning [19:27] correct [19:27] so some of the students were testing [19:29] some of the requirements now when they [19:30] test the requirements [19:31] they come out here and they have to test [19:33] the exact same way they would if they [19:35] were competing [19:36] in the actual competition right like igp [19:39] or you name it yeah so it's graded the [19:42] same way you guys have your grading [19:44] sheets and [19:45] so it gives them that experience of [19:46] being able to compete which is a great [19:48] way [19:48] for a new dog trainer any dog trainer [19:51] really to [19:52] show that they can do what they say they [19:54] can do all right next if you don't mind [19:56] maybe we can take a trip to the ranch [19:58] and show them the ranch where they can [19:59] do [20:00] sure i always enjoy that all right [20:01] awesome it's a beautiful day let's let's [20:03] get on over there [20:04] okay one of the requirements in order to [20:06] become a certified professional dog [20:08] trainer [20:09] is igp obedience tom can you tell us [20:12] what's [20:13] behind us yeah we're looking at a [20:15] regulation size [20:17] training field for many disciplines [20:19] we've had agility trials out here psa [20:22] trials [20:22] uh shuts in igp whatever [20:26] and it's it's flat it's nice we keep it [20:29] up [20:30] and we have jumps already set up [20:33] and we got an overhead wire for working [20:35] on recalls and send outs [20:36] so it's a beautiful place to both train [20:39] and show your dog [20:40] excellent that's something that's really [20:41] important when the students are coming [20:43] through the program because we want them [20:44] to be [20:45] i should say you want them to be as [20:46] prepared as possible [20:48] when they graduate that they really know [20:50] the dog training industry not just pet [20:52] training [20:53] but also competition obedience right [20:54] yeah and i always tell people if you [20:56] could train a dog to competition level [20:57] obedience [20:59] pet training is easy it is you know so [21:01] this is a really great field i love this [21:03] field when i was here going to the [21:05] school i trained here all the time and [21:06] it's something that's available to the [21:07] students [21:08] that come to the tom rose school so [21:10] let's head over to some of the other [21:11] fields i'd love our viewers [21:12] to see the fields where the students are [21:14] able to track great okay [21:16] not only are the students able to train [21:18] in a championship size [21:20] igp field the students also have full [21:23] access to tom's 260 acre ranch [21:26] that has multiple fields to train in [21:29] whether the students want to [21:30] generalize their dogs to the obedience [21:33] by training in multiple locations [21:36] work competition style tracking teach [21:38] search and rescue to their dogs or [21:40] even just play and exercise this ranch [21:43] has it all [21:44] the tom rose school truly is the world's [21:48] elite dog training academy [21:50] had it not been for the excellent [21:51] instructions and professionalism by tom [21:54] rose at the school [21:55] i wouldn't be in the position that i am [21:57] today the school gave me the tools [22:00] necessary to thrive in the profession [22:02] that i love [22:03] by teaching me everything from the [22:05] ground up and [22:06] helped me to develop into the trainer i [22:09] am today [22:10] by showing me what i needed to know and [22:12] understand [22:13] in order to perfect this art by breaking [22:16] down the science [22:17] i was taught every different style and [22:19] modern technique available [22:21] and i've been able to choose which is [22:23] best suited for me [22:25] and the dogs i'm working with they [22:27] covered everything from basic [22:29] obedience all the way to advanced [22:31] competition training [22:33] service dog training and everything in [22:35] between [22:36] if you truly want to become a [22:38] professional dog trainer [22:40] and

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 109/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode today we will be doing a q a [00:03] video where i answer some of your dog [00:05] training questions [00:06] i'm gonna be answering 10 dog training [00:08] questions in each video [00:10] so if yours is not in this video then it [00:12] should be in one of the following videos [00:14] in this series be sure to check the [00:15] description where you can find your [00:17] question and you could jump to that [00:18] section [00:19] in the video so let's go ahead and get [00:21] started the first question [00:22] is my dog is afraid of going down our [00:24] spiral staircase [00:26] how can we help her overcome this she's [00:27] a nine month old malinois [00:29] often dogs will go through what's known [00:31] as a fear period between seven to nine [00:33] months of age this is where they're [00:34] afraid of things that they may not have [00:36] been afraid of before or things that [00:38] really there's no logic behind their [00:40] fear at least not to us humans but to [00:42] them [00:42] it's very real so we can help them [00:44] overcome this by implementing what's [00:46] known as counter conditioning [00:48] or desensitization where we take [00:50] whatever it is that they're afraid of [00:51] and we make it predict [00:52] something pleasant this is the most [00:54] simplified way of explaining it it's [00:56] also very similar to confidence [00:58] building the main difference between [00:59] counter conditioning and confidence [01:01] building [01:01] is with confidence building you just [01:03] expose your dog to new things and you [01:05] make these things predict something [01:07] pleasant therefore creating a positive [01:08] association [01:09] with counter conditioning it's something [01:11] the dog is afraid of and you're trying [01:12] to change the way they feel about [01:14] whatever it is [01:15] by making it predict something nice so [01:17] with this specific situation what i [01:19] would do [01:20] is i would turn meal time into training [01:22] time meaning [01:23] i would train my dog with my dog's meals [01:26] and if my dog is not willing to train my [01:29] dog doesn't eat [01:30] this will also increase the dog's food [01:32] drive so i would bring the dog out to [01:33] the top of the spiral [01:35] spiral staircase i would offer her some [01:37] food if she doesn't take it no big deal [01:40] we try again at dinner time making sure [01:42] we do not give any food in between [01:44] the training session bring her back out [01:47] bring her to the top of the staircase [01:48] i'm not going to ask her to go down the [01:50] staircase the very first time [01:52] just at the very top i'll give her some [01:53] rewards get her comfortable there [01:55] excellent do some obedience now we were [01:58] able to feed her a meal and then we're [01:59] gonna do it again the next day [02:01] see if she's more comfortable if she's [02:02] more comfortable i might ask her [02:04] to try to place one step or one paw [02:07] rather on the very first step [02:09] if she does that i reward then we do [02:11] some obedience again at the top of the [02:12] stairs [02:13] not asking too much too soon as she [02:16] becomes more comfortable with that [02:18] i'd gradually start asking for more [02:19] steps as she successfully accomplishes [02:22] each step [02:23] i would mark and reward if i've been [02:24] doing this for a while and the dog is [02:26] still a little cautious [02:27] of going down the stairs then i could [02:29] also teach the dog leash pressure [02:32] make the dog understand that they have [02:33] to go with the pressure on the leash [02:35] and then i can use that to get my dog to [02:37] go down the stairs as well [02:39] maybe not the entire staircase at the [02:41] very beginning but a few steps [02:43] getting her comfortable allowing her to [02:45] go back up the stairs [02:46] and repeating this process until i'm [02:48] able to get her to go down the entire [02:50] staircase this can take [02:54] a long time depending on the dog or it [02:56] could happen in a few days it really [02:57] depends [02:58] you just want to make sure you're [02:59] progressing at the pace in which [03:01] she's learning and her confidence is [03:03] going up based on successful reps [03:05] so i hope that helps let's go on to the [03:08] next question [03:08] how do i start a 12 week old puppy on [03:11] scent detection [03:12] okay so what you're going to want to do [03:13] with this this is the imprinting stage [03:15] for a dog the first 16 weeks [03:17] and it's great that you're starting at [03:18] this young age what we want to do we're [03:20] not worried about making the puppy [03:22] an expert at scent detection that's not [03:24] the goal but what you do want to do is [03:26] make the puppy [03:27] love scent detection training if you've [03:29] seen my scent detection series you could [03:31] probably start with step [03:32] two field search or just creating a [03:35] positive association [03:37] with the odor by having that odor [03:39] predict your puppy's favorite toy [03:41] what i would do is i would take the [03:42] puppy's favorite toy and i would put it [03:44] in an airtight container with the odor [03:46] that we want to teach the puppy on the [03:48] inside of the lid [03:49] not directly on the toy you leave it in [03:51] there overnight and there's going to be [03:53] a strong enough of an odor [03:55] on the toy and then you're just going to [03:56] play with your puppy with the toy [03:58] you can start doing field searches like [04:00] i demonstrate in [04:01] the second episode in the scent [04:03] detection series but just don't expect [04:05] as much from a young puppy maybe toss it [04:07] in front of them [04:08] maybe spin them a little bit and then [04:09] send them to get the toy so then they're [04:11] going to go where they [04:13] saw the toy last and then they will [04:14] naturally instinctively use their nose [04:17] to find the toy and then that's going to [04:19] be the main thing that i'm going to work [04:21] on with the puppy really creating that [04:23] strong association [04:24] to that odor by having that odor predict [04:26] a toy you can also start doing [04:28] free shaping free shaping is going to be [04:30] a big part of doing scent detection [04:32] training [04:33] because with the scent dog we want them [04:34] to be willing to work [04:36] in order to get access to a reward [04:38] without having to always rely on the [04:41] handler [04:41] and scent detection is helped great deal [04:45] by doing free shaping [04:46] free shaping is we don't have anything [04:48] in mind we want the dog to do [04:50] but when they do something that we like [04:52] we mark and reward [04:54] it doesn't have to be something [04:55] complicated just anything that [04:57] the puppy does that you like maybe the [04:59] puppy lays down the puppy sits [05:01] he looks at you he spins whatever if [05:03] he's doing something that you like [05:04] mark and reward without asking him to [05:06] perform these behaviors [05:08] this creates that proactive dog the dog [05:10] that starts to seek out behaviors that [05:12] predict [05:13] rewards and if you feel like going above [05:15] and beyond [05:16] then you can do the first step that i [05:18] have in the scent detection series [05:19] where you start having your dog jump up [05:21] on the climb platform in order to get [05:22] access [05:23] to the reward so again that would be fix [05:25] shaping you have something in mind you [05:27] want your puppy to do [05:28] you don't ask your puppy to do it you [05:30] wait till your puppy makes the right [05:31] choice [05:32] then you mark and reward and you can [05:34] even have your young pup [05:36] sticking his or her nose into the [05:38] container [05:39] in order to get the reward as well that [05:41] i demonstrate in my scent detection [05:42] video series so [05:43] to answer your question make it as fun [05:45] as possible make your puppy love the [05:46] scent detection training [05:48] build your pups confidence and do some [05:50] of that free shaping [05:52] that will help create that proactive dog [05:55] all right next question how do you get a [05:57] puppy to not [05:58] bark constantly while playing this one's [06:00] a little bit more difficult [06:02] to work with the reason why is if your [06:04] puppy is barking out of play [06:06] that's very similar to my dog ari she [06:08] barks all the time for play [06:10] excitement she barks she loves to do it [06:12] and i made the mistake of rewarding that [06:14] behavior when she was a puppy [06:16] and because of that i'm not going to try [06:18] to correct it because if i try to stop [06:21] it [06:21] while she's playing she may associate it [06:24] with plane [06:25] and then become uncomfortable or not [06:27] know when it's okay [06:28] to play and if this is the case usually [06:31] my recommendation is to let the puppy or [06:33] let the dog bark while playing [06:35] if you really do want to stop it then [06:37] one of the things you can do [06:39] is start playing with your dog or your [06:40] puppy the moment [06:42] the dog starts to bark stop the play [06:46] wait a minute start playing again your [06:48] dog barks [06:49] stop playing you want to show your dog [06:51] that barking [06:53] is going to stop the game it's not going [06:55] to predict a correction or anything [06:57] that's going to seem unpleasant it's [06:59] just going to stop the game [07:00] and then if your young pup is able to [07:03] pick up on this then hopefully [07:04] the idea is that he will stop barking [07:08] while playing because he learned that [07:09] barking stops the game if he doesn't [07:11] want the game to stop [07:12] he doesn't continue to do that behavior [07:14] so i hope that helps [07:16] do you use corrections when training a [07:17] dog if so at what point do you find it [07:19] necessary to give a dog a correction [07:22] if you do corrections correctly you can [07:24] create a very reliably trained dog [07:27] in any environment in fact the only way [07:29] you can get a dog [07:30] to be at 100 reliability is by [07:33] implementing [07:34] positive punishment a form of a [07:36] correction to stop [07:37] an undesired behavior or to get [07:40] reliability within our obedience [07:41] commands [07:42] we have two types of issues when dealing [07:44] with a dog we have behavioral issues [07:46] and we have obedience issues now if our [07:48] dog is doing a behavioral issue and it's [07:50] a [07:51] self-rewarding or self-fulfilling [07:53] behavioral issue [07:54] then that needs to either be stopped one [07:58] of two ways [07:58] by preventing the dog from being able to [08:01] practice the behavior simply not [08:02] allowing them to do it or correcting [08:05] them for doing the behavior [08:07] for example let's talk about a dog that [08:09] jumps up on people [08:10] if the dog is jumping up on people [08:12] because the act of jumping up on people [08:14] is something the dog enjoys [08:16] then the technique of simply turning [08:19] your back and crossing your arms and [08:20] ignoring the dog [08:21] is not going to work in this situation [08:24] the reason is because the dog likes [08:25] jumping [08:26] so the dog will continue to jump now if [08:29] the dog was only interested [08:30] in the attention and being pet by the [08:33] human and if the dog jumped up the human [08:35] turned away and crossed their arms [08:37] now this is creating the exact opposite [08:40] of what that dog's [08:41] goal was and if you wait for that dog to [08:43] stop jumping up and then you start to [08:45] pet him [08:45] then that dog will learn okay if i want [08:47] to receive attention and affection from [08:49] this human [08:50] then i have to sit politely on the [08:52] ground and they will provide that reward [08:54] for me [08:54] jumping up simply makes it go away [08:56] that's implementing negative punishment [08:58] removing something of value [09:00] from the dog for doing a specific [09:02] behavior so those situations we have to [09:04] adjust accordingly to each dog [09:07] now if it's a behavioral issue something [09:09] such as digging or getting into the [09:11] trash or chasing after cars [09:13] those i do correct right away i use [09:15] positive punishment to remove that from [09:17] the dog's repertoire [09:18] now when we're correcting our dog the [09:20] correction has to be adequate to that [09:21] dog's training level [09:23] an analogy i often talk about is a [09:25] speeding ticket analogy [09:26] let's say you're driving down the [09:27] highway police officer pulls you over [09:29] and writes you a 25 cent speeding ticket [09:31] you're probably going to keep speeding [09:33] it's not enough to get you to slow down [09:35] or to get you to change your behavior [09:36] but let's look at the other extreme end [09:38] of the spectrum this would be known as [09:40] an avoidance level correction a [09:42] correction so high [09:43] you never do the behavior ever again [09:45] that would be if the police officer [09:46] pulled you over and wrote you a hundred [09:48] thousand dollar speeding ticket [09:50] you're never going to want to drive [09:51] again it's not going to be worth it [09:52] you're going to be stressed out and [09:54] you're going to avoid driving [09:56] now let's say that he writes you a 200 [09:58] speeding ticket that's enough to get you [10:00] to slow down without getting you to [10:01] avoid the behavior of driving [10:03] now that's the same when we're [10:04] implementing any sort of positive [10:06] punishment a physical correction to our [10:08] dogs [10:08] it has to be adequate to their bank [10:10] account some dogs are very rich [10:12] some are very poor if you're giving your [10:14] dog a correction and that dog continues [10:16] to practice the undesired behavior [10:18] then the correction is not high enough [10:20] remember everything our dogs do is based [10:22] on motivation [10:23] they're either motivated to access [10:24] something pleasant or they're motivated [10:26] to prevent something unpleasant or the [10:28] behavior itself [10:29] is fun if i give a dog a correction and [10:31] they continue to do that behavior [10:33] that means the motivation to do the [10:35] behavior is overriding the motivation to [10:37] prevent the correction [10:39] look at bank robberies for example why [10:42] do most people choose not to rob the [10:44] bank [10:44] because the motivation not to go to jail [10:46] overrides the motivation to make a quick [10:48] buck [10:49] now some people still rob the banks [10:51] those people their motivation to make [10:53] the money overrides the motivation to [10:55] prevent going to jail so we have to look [10:57] at each dog's [10:58] individual motivating factors if it's a [11:01] normal behavioral issue we can just [11:03] correct it [11:03] and that will normally remove it from [11:05] the dog's [11:07] behaviors however if the behavior is [11:10] based on fear just like earlier you [11:12] cannot use a physical correction [11:14] to stop that behavior it's only going to [11:16] make it worse if you have a dog afraid [11:17] of something and you correct them to try [11:19] to get them over the fear [11:20] their fear becomes worse because you're [11:22] solidifying that they should be afraid [11:24] of whatever it is you're trying to [11:25] correct so if you're dealing with fear [11:28] counter conditioning and desensitizing [11:30] them is going to be your best friend [11:31] when it comes to fixing those issues [11:33] but if it's not based on fear let's say [11:35] digging the dog goes to dig i have a [11:37] leash and collar on the dog [11:38] the dog is digging the moment they're [11:40] digging i say no [11:41] i pop the leash giving them a correction [11:43] the moment they stop digging [11:45] yay good puppy when giving corrections [11:48] we have to make sure [11:49] to never make the corrections personal [11:51] meaning we don't get angry we don't [11:53] yell it's simple cause and effect if you [11:56] go to dig [11:57] i can't help it i have to pop the leash [11:59] giving you a correction [12:00] and the moment you stop i'm going to [12:01] praise and reward you for making the [12:03] correct [12:03] decision this is important again we [12:06] don't ever want to get mad we don't want [12:08] to yell at them that could create fear [12:10] and that could create or it could lower [12:12] their confidence and remember we're [12:14] always trying to build their confidence [12:15] we're working together with our dogs on [12:18] the same team [12:18] towards a common goal now let's talk [12:21] about obedience this is going to be [12:22] different from our behavioral issues [12:24] if i'm correcting my dog for obedience [12:26] there's certain things that are required [12:27] before they're given any sort of [12:29] correction [12:30] and again my corrections if i am using [12:32] them i'm using a training collar [12:34] with a leash or remote training collar [12:37] depends on what i'm trying to accomplish [12:39] if i want a dog to be off leash trained [12:41] then remote training collar is going to [12:43] be the only way to do that [12:44] to where we can have the dog 100 [12:47] reliable [12:48] and i 100 off leash reliable so [12:51] both my dogs charlie and ari are trained [12:53] on a remote collar [12:54] and i use a remote collar every time i [12:56] take them to a location where they're [12:58] going to be off leash [12:59] i almost never have to correct them but [13:01] i want to have that control [13:03] so let's say i'm taking my dogs on a [13:05] hike and they see a coyote [13:06] and they decide they want to chase the [13:08] coyote i can stop them [13:10] with the remote training collar i like [13:12] to call it my safety net [13:13] we don't want to fall into our safety [13:15] net but if we do fall it's there to [13:17] catch us [13:17] and that's why we use this again for [13:19] reliability and making sure our dogs are [13:22] as safe as possible nobody gets a dog to [13:24] correct them [13:24] but we correct them to make sure they're [13:26] safe in the world in which they live [13:28] with us humans [13:29] so now in order to correct a dog for [13:31] obedience the process that i take is [13:33] number one they [13:34] have to know what command i'm asking [13:35] them to perform so we're going to talk [13:36] about correcting for obedience commands [13:39] if i give a dog a command let's say down [13:40] and the dog chooses not to do it [13:42] well i have to make sure they know the [13:44] command on the verbal alone [13:45] that means i tell the dog down and the [13:47] dog lays down every single time [13:49] on the verbal command without being [13:51] helped with the physical cue [13:54] the next step is the dog also has to [13:56] know how to turn off pressure [13:58] by complying we do this by leash [14:00] pressure training [14:01] leash pressure work is one of the [14:03] biggest things when it comes to training [14:04] a dog [14:05] clearly and effectively and not creating [14:08] any issues [14:09] i'm laughing because ari keeps looking [14:10] up at the camera she keeps walking back [14:12] and forth [14:13] but leash pressure is huge and i highly [14:15] recommend if you haven't watched my [14:17] leash pressure training video [14:18] to check it out and start implementing [14:20] leash pressure in your training [14:22] now i have a dog i tell the dog to down [14:24] if the dog goes into a different [14:25] commanded position [14:27] let's say the sit that's when i use the [14:30] non-reinforcement marker which is a [14:32] signal [14:32] for negative punishment withholding a [14:34] reward so i have the treat let's say [14:36] you're the dog i say down you sit [14:38] instead i say wrong [14:39] down you go down yes reward so then i'm [14:42] giving the dog a clear path [14:44] to get the reward and i'm not correcting [14:46] them when they're making a mistake [14:48] we don't want to correct dogs for [14:49] mistakes because if we start correcting [14:51] them for mistakes they're not going to [14:52] be as willing to try new things [14:54] for example if you've seen my video on [14:56] how to teach a dog to ring a bell [14:58] ari i never corrected her for making a [14:59] mistake so she's always willing to try [15:02] new things in order to get access to the [15:04] reward so that's very important [15:06] now i teach the dog how to turn off [15:07] pressure by complying by using the leash [15:09] pressure so when i first start giving a [15:10] dog a command when they first [15:12] start choosing not to listen to it i [15:14] reinforce it with the leash pressure [15:16] now if you're using a word that predicts [15:18] leash pressure then you want to use a [15:20] different word that predicts a [15:21] correction with the training collar [15:24] the reason for this is if you use the [15:25] same word for both [15:27] and the dog becomes conditioned to the [15:28] word predicting a correction [15:30] when you're using it for leash pressure [15:32] the dog is still going to have all the [15:34] same [15:34] associations with whatever it is that [15:36] you're doing that they would feel [15:38] when you correct them a dog trainer that [15:40] i'm a huge fan of michael ellis i love [15:42] the way he explains this in one of his [15:44] videos [15:44] he says if i walk up to you every day [15:46] and i say hey and i punch you in your [15:48] stomach [15:48] eventually i walk up to you i go hey you [15:50] go huh whether or not i hit you [15:52] the body takes over so it's the same [15:54] with our dog so we want to make sure we [15:56] use a different word that predicts [15:58] one predicts leash pressure the other [15:59] one predicts a leash pop or a correction [16:01] on the training collar [16:02] so i tell the dog to down this would be [16:04] the first step the dog chooses not to [16:05] down [16:06] i say wrong that's my word for the leash [16:08] pressure let's say or bad or uh [16:10] whatever we want to use then i apply the [16:12] leash pressure placing the dog into the [16:13] commanded position [16:14] i release the pressure once they do it [16:16] good job [16:17] so i'm going to first start doing that [16:19] so then if they make a mistake they know [16:21] what they have to do in order to fix [16:23] that mistake [16:24] this is again very important when we [16:26] correct a dog they have to know [16:27] what they're being corrected for they [16:29] have to know how to turn off pressure by [16:30] complying [16:31] while we're giving them a very clear [16:33] path to success so now i've done all [16:34] these steps [16:35] i tell let's say i tell the dog to sit [16:37] the dog looks at me and says i don't [16:39] want to sit [16:40] within the first second of the dog [16:41] choosing not to sit i say one no [16:43] i pop the leash upward giving the dog [16:45] the direction [16:46] that i want them to do the behavior up [16:48] is for sit if we're doing leash pressure [16:49] training so they should understand that [16:51] after i give the correction i recommand [16:53] sit then i help the dog go into the [16:56] commanded position with [16:57] the leash pressure i don't continue to [16:59] correct for the same mistake [17:02] over and over again and when you first [17:03] start adding corrections to a dog [17:05] it might get them a little flustered [17:07] they're not used to it so they're not [17:09] thinking as clearly [17:10] so we want to help them be successful we [17:12] wouldn't want to go [17:13] sit no correction sit no correction [17:17] set no correction that would be very [17:19] unfair we do not want to do that [17:20] it would be sit the dog doesn't sit no [17:22] correction sit we help the dog release [17:24] pressure good dog [17:25] that's going to help get you to a point [17:27] where you have very reliable obedience [17:29] without creating any sort of fear or [17:31] additional stress [17:32] with your dog again my dogs are trained [17:35] on remote collars it gives them absolute [17:37] freedom [17:37] they can run around and do whatever it [17:39] is that they want because i have control [17:41] of the remote collar so [17:42] this information is also going to be [17:44] written out in my training manual [17:45] version 3 when it's released should be [17:47] here in a couple weeks [17:48] maybe a week or so so be sure to check [17:50] that out i hope that answers your [17:52] question but that's the process [17:53] basically that i like to follow [17:55] when i'm implementing corrections in my [17:57] dog training routine [17:58] all right next question how do you [18:00] increase motivation and drive in a dog [18:02] that's only moderately interested in [18:04] food and toys [18:05] when it comes to increasing our dog's [18:07] motivation there are a few things that [18:08] we can do when a dog doesn't have a very [18:10] high food drive [18:11] that's often caused by a few different [18:13] things one it could be the dog is being [18:15] free fed [18:16] sometimes just feeding a dog out of a [18:18] bowl will lower the dog's food drive [18:21] giving the dog very high value rewards [18:23] such as [18:24] a cooked piece of steak may lower your [18:26] dog's food drive [18:28] when i'm raising a dog especially during [18:30] their imprinting stage [18:32] that first 16 weeks i make them work for [18:34] every [18:35] bite of food which greatly increases the [18:38] value [18:38] into adulthood so then when i'm working [18:40] with that dog as an adult [18:42] even if they just ate a full meal and [18:44] they're comfortable [18:45] they're still gonna want to work for the [18:47] food because i did that during the [18:48] imprinting stage by making them work for [18:50] every bite of food [18:51] so simply by turning meal time into [18:53] training time and what i mean by that is [18:55] you use the dog's meal in order to train [18:58] them [18:58] now sometimes depending on where you are [19:00] in the training if you're doing [19:01] continual reinforcement still rewarding [19:04] every single behavior [19:05] then you can just use every single [19:08] behavior as an opportunity to give your [19:09] dog [19:10] some of their food if you're spacing out [19:12] the rewards so your dog's not getting a [19:14] reward now [19:15] after every single rep then you could [19:16] just give the dog larger handfuls when [19:19] they do complete [19:20] 10 correct behaviors or wherever it is [19:23] that you are in your training [19:25] so you're still able to use meal time as [19:28] training time [19:29] that will increase the dog's food drive [19:30] and that's my number one recommendation [19:33] if you bring your dog out i talked about [19:35] this a little earlier in the video [19:36] if you bring your dog out and you ask [19:38] your dog to do a behavior for food and [19:40] they say [19:41] i'm not interested no problem you stop [19:43] training [19:44] you don't give the dog any food when [19:47] dinner time rolls around [19:48] you offer the dog another opportunity to [19:51] train for the food [19:52] if the dog still says nope not [19:53] interested you say no problem we'll try [19:55] again at breakfast [19:56] breakfast rolls around you offer the [19:58] food to your dog while training your dog [20:00] says okay now i'm hungry i'm willing to [20:02] work for the food and that's going to [20:04] increase the dog's food drive [20:05] i've done that with a lot of dogs that [20:06] had very low food motivation [20:08] and i was able to increase their food [20:10] motivation [20:11] really fast by implementing that [20:13] technique now when it comes to toy drive [20:16] one of the best ways to increase our [20:17] dog's toy drive is by using [20:20] dry building exercises you can see an [20:22] example of this [20:23] in my video on how to teach your dog to [20:25] bark on command you can do this one of [20:27] two ways you can [20:28] have your dog with either a harness or [20:30] an agitation collar on an agitation [20:32] collar is a very thick collar [20:34] that distributes the pressure across [20:35] their entire neck so they're able to [20:37] pull [20:38] or you can use a harness designed to [20:40] pull [20:41] and then you can have either somebody [20:42] holding the leash like we're doing in [20:44] the video [20:44] or you can have it attached to something [20:48] i like to have it attached a little bit [20:49] higher off the ground because then the [20:51] dog's pulling and they're not going to [20:52] step on the leash [20:53] you could have it lower as well but they [20:55] might step on the leash while doing the [20:56] dry building exercise so a little higher [20:58] is going to be better to prevent that [21:00] then you tease them with the toy you [21:01] tease them you act like hey this toy is [21:03] the most amazing thing wouldn't it be [21:05] fun if you could play with it [21:06] and when they get frustrated enough or [21:08] they bark then you reward them with the [21:10] toy [21:11] so you're using frustration in order to [21:13] increase [21:14] the dog's toy drive so usually that will [21:16] work [21:17] and i'll do that once a day for a couple [21:20] weeks to really build the dog's food [21:21] drive so [21:22] check out the video you can see how we [21:23] do it there and i'm going to be putting [21:25] up more videos in the future [21:26] specifically on dry building exercises [21:30] my eight-month-old golden retriever gets [21:31] super excited when my sibling runs [21:34] around [21:34] he will then jump up and grab onto their [21:37] arm he doesn't bite he just holds on but [21:38] it's enough that it doesn't feel very [21:40] good [21:40] how do i teach him to stop or at least [21:42] let go when asked [21:44] this is going to go back to the leash [21:45] pressure training that we talked about [21:47] earlier leash pressure has so many [21:48] different applications when it comes to [21:50] clearly communicating with our dog and [21:52] it really should be called a leash cue [21:54] because we're using it as a cue again [21:56] for clear communication the more [21:58] clear we are to our dogs the faster they [22:00] learn and this is what i would do in [22:02] this situation first i'm going to teach [22:04] the dog [22:04] how to turn off pressure by compliant [22:06] and that goes right with the leash [22:07] pressure training [22:08] and i implement the word whatever word [22:10] we want to choose again just be [22:11] consistent with it for this example [22:13] let's just stick with the word wrong [22:15] so i can use it for multiple things that [22:17] i don't want the dog to do without [22:18] adding a correction so let's say the dog [22:20] jumps up on the couch [22:21] i can go wrong i can use the leash [22:23] pressure cue the dog off the couch good [22:25] dog [22:27] name it whatever it is the dog gets into [22:29] something you don't want wrong [22:30] apply leash pressure they stop yay good [22:32] dog so we're giving them an [22:33] opportunity to learn what they're not [22:35] supposed to do without giving them a [22:36] correction [22:37] i also like to use this when i have a [22:38] dog that's interacting with another dog [22:40] or another human [22:41] when they're doing something that i [22:42] don't want i never recommend [22:45] implementing any form of positive [22:46] punishment when a dog is [22:48] actively engaged with another dog or [22:50] another human [22:51] the reason why is because they could end [22:53] up believing that it's the other dog or [22:55] human that's causing the correction [22:57] at least when the correction comes from [22:58] their neck so if you're correcting your [23:00] dog on a training collar around their [23:02] neck [23:02] they could think it's the other person [23:03] or the other human so we don't want to [23:05] do that because we don't want to create [23:06] any sort of aggression [23:08] towards people or dogs so what i do [23:10] rather in the situation [23:11] is i use the leash pressure i set the [23:14] puppy up [23:15] puppy runs and bites whoever [23:18] and i say wrong i apply the leash [23:20] pressure the moment the puppy stops [23:21] biting i turn the pressure off yay good [23:24] pup [23:24] and then we're able to continue going [23:26] from there anytime the puppy does that [23:27] behavior [23:28] wrong i use a leash pressure preventing [23:30] them from being able to practice it [23:32] and after enough reps the pup says [23:34] there's no value in biting all it does [23:36] is it stops the play it predicts leash [23:38] pressure [23:39] so i'm not going to continue to practice [23:41] this and the behavior should quickly [23:42] become [23:43] a behavior of the past all right next [23:46] question [23:47] my dog goes crazy with the mailman but i [23:49] feel like she's afraid but aggressively [23:51] barking [23:51] what are the steps i could take to [23:53] handle this this is another question [23:55] that goes back to our counter [23:56] conditioning and we have a situation [23:58] where the dog is afraid of the male [23:59] person [24:00] what we want to do is at least this is [24:02] what i would do is i would find out what [24:03] time on average the mailman comes around [24:06] if i'm not able to do any training [24:08] during this time [24:09] then i'm gonna make sure my dog or my [24:11] puppy simply can't see when the mailman [24:13] comes by [24:14] i'm gonna put the dog in the crate or [24:16] the puppy in the crate whatever just to [24:17] reduce the likelihood of the dog [24:19] practicing this bad behavior that i [24:20] don't want which is going to be barking [24:22] now if i'm able to be in the situation [24:24] when the mailman comes around [24:26] then what i'm going to do is i'm going [24:27] to reward my dog and i'm going to do [24:29] obedience so i'm going to make sure i'm [24:32] far enough away so let's say [24:33] up at the front window is where the dog [24:35] is going to react [24:36] the most to the mailman or the male [24:38] person coming around then i'm going to [24:40] make sure i'm training my dog [24:41] perhaps in the kitchen where my dog can [24:43] see the front window and may be able to [24:45] see the mailman [24:46] but is far enough away to where it's not [24:48] going to [24:49] create any sort of response or reaction [24:52] from my dog [24:53] as my dog gets more comfortable training [24:56] while the person comes by so now i'm [24:57] creating a positive association because [25:00] i'm training which [25:01] your dog should enjoy if you're doing [25:02] the training correctly because it [25:04] predicts play it predicts engagement and [25:06] predicts rewards [25:07] so now we're creating that positive [25:08] association by having [25:10] the male person coming around predict [25:12] training if your dog stops in the middle [25:14] of the training [25:15] and barks then what you can do is you [25:16] can back up a little farther to where [25:19] there's not as much of an opportunity or [25:22] there's not as much of the stimuli in [25:24] order to create that reaction so the [25:26] farther you are away from the stimuli [25:28] the less likely your dog is going to be [25:30] to react to it [25:31] and as your dog becomes better with this [25:33] you simply get closer and closer to [25:35] where [25:35] your dog would be in the position [25:36] reacting in a way that you don't want [25:38] but no longer reacting because now the [25:40] dog is more focused on obedience [25:42] so again we take something that the dog [25:44] may be afraid of and we change the way [25:46] they feel by having it predict something [25:48] pleasant [25:48] you just have to make sure anytime [25:50] you're doing counter conditioning that [25:51] you're not rewarding your dog when your [25:53] dog is acting out the fearful or the [25:55] undesired behavior [25:57] because if you do that if you're [25:58] rewarding the dog while they're doing [25:59] the behavior you don't like [26:00] then the dog is going to think that's a [26:02] behavior you want and they're going to [26:04] end up repeating it even more so [26:05] very important make sure you don't [26:07] reward while your dog's acting out the [26:08] bad behavior [26:09] another thing you can do is when your [26:10] dog sees the mailman get your dog's [26:12] attention the moment your dog looks back [26:14] at you [26:15] mark and reward so then your dog's [26:16] responsibility becomes i see the mailman [26:19] i look at you i get a treat [26:20] i see the mailman i look at you i get a [26:22] treat and then that's going to be their [26:24] default behavior so again we change what [26:26] it means by what it predicts [26:28] how to deal with reactivity towards [26:29] other dogs on and off leash [26:31] my dog is a female 1 year old border [26:33] collie and she hates it when other dogs [26:35] are on the leash or behind a fence and [26:37] she barks like crazy [26:38] pulls horribly does flips in the air and [26:40] i get scared she'll get hurt [26:42] when we're at the park she's very social [26:44] with the dogs that are inside but hates [26:46] the ones that pass [26:47] outside when i take her on walks she [26:49] barks at dogs that are even inside their [26:51] houses [26:51] the fact that your dog is comfortable [26:53] with other dogs while she's in the park [26:54] makes me believe that her reactivity [26:57] does not have to do with fear but rather [26:59] more frustration just like where i was [27:01] talking about building a dog's [27:02] frustration in order to increase a dog's [27:04] food drive [27:05] by putting them on a back tie and using [27:07] that frustration [27:08] in order to get the dog to bark our dogs [27:11] may do the same thing [27:12] on their own when they're on a leash or [27:14] there's some sort of barrier [27:16] it could be that your dog wants to get [27:18] to these other dogs and that frustration [27:20] is coming out as barks [27:21] if you don't want your dog to bark while [27:23] going on a walk i've dealt with a lot of [27:25] dogs that have this exact same issue [27:27] and often just implementing positive [27:29] punishment is going to stop the dog from [27:31] doing that behavior [27:32] so you take your dog on a walk again if [27:34] you're adding any sort of corrections [27:36] and training follow the steps that i [27:37] talked about earlier in this video [27:39] but i would take the dog i would be far [27:41] enough away to where it's not going to [27:42] create a strong reaction [27:44] but enough to where i can do a [27:45] correction this is going to keep it at a [27:48] low enough of a level so where the [27:49] correction doesn't have to be that high [27:51] since the stimuli is not that high [27:53] when the dog goes to bark or whenever [27:55] the dog is doing whatever i don't like [27:57] i can first start by implementing leash [27:59] pressure so i say my wrong i lift up on [28:02] the leash [28:02] the dog sits i turn off the pressure the [28:04] dog stops barking good dog [28:06] if the dog continues to act it out the [28:08] dog barks or gets [28:09] frustrated at the other dog no [28:11] correction the moment the dog stops [28:13] barking yay [28:15] good dog and we pet and reward them for [28:16] doing the correct behavior [28:18] so again the process is always going to [28:20] be the same first we show them what we [28:22] what we don't want them to do by using [28:23] the leash pressure that's going to be [28:25] the best way in order to make sure the [28:27] dog has a very clear path to success [28:29] and then if they continue to practice [28:30] out the behavior we can implement [28:32] positive punishment [28:33] make sure it's at your dog's correction [28:35] level again what we talked about earlier [28:38] you don't want it so high that your dog [28:40] avoids [28:41] the behavior entirely meaning if you [28:43] corrected her too high when she was out [28:44] and about on a walk she may not want to [28:46] go on a walk anymore so [28:48] again we want to make sure the [28:49] correction is adequate to her bank [28:50] account [28:51] and we also don't want the correction to [28:52] be so low that she continues to do the [28:55] behavior that we don't want [28:56] however when it does come to correcting [28:58] i always prefer to start on the lower [28:59] end [29:00] and increase if necessary i hope this [29:03] answers your question [29:04] how to stop resource guarding with me [29:06] and my family my dog doesn't like other [29:08] dogs to even get near us [29:09] let alone try to be pet by us she gets [29:12] very aggressive and only leaves the dog [29:13] alone once they back off of us [29:15] mind you she isn't like this with [29:17] anything else not food or toys nothing [29:20] just the family this is another common [29:22] problem that a lot of people run into [29:24] the dog is resource guarding the humans [29:26] is what's happening [29:27] and this is one of the few occasions [29:29] where a dog is doing a form of resource [29:31] guarding [29:32] and we can correct them for it i usually [29:34] don't recommend correcting a dog that is [29:35] resource guarding food or toys [29:38] as it can often make the aggression [29:39] worse there are different steps that we [29:41] can do to fix those types of issues [29:43] but when it comes to a dog resource [29:45] guarding a human the human that the dog [29:47] is resource guarding [29:48] corrects the dog that is the best way [29:50] and the fastest way rather [29:52] to stop a dog from resource guarding a [29:54] human so if i had ari sitting next to me [29:56] and somebody walked up and she barked [29:58] and snapped at them i would say no [30:00] i would give her a correction on the [30:01] training collar the moment she stopped [30:03] that would say good dog [30:04] the reason why i'm going to correct that [30:06] right away i'm not even going to do the [30:07] leash pressure i'm just going to correct [30:08] it i want it out of the dog's repertoire [30:10] i don't want them practicing something [30:11] again [30:12] that could be potentially dangerous [30:14] either for themselves [30:15] or for somebody else and usually when [30:18] you correct a dog for resource guarding [30:20] you [30:20] as the human they go oh i'm sorry i did [30:23] not know you didn't want me to do that [30:25] i'll stop so again this is a situation [30:28] where i would use positive punishment [30:30] and the way i would do it [30:31] just like i talked about earlier we [30:32] don't want to make it personal the [30:34] correction [30:35] we're never angry we're not upset it's [30:36] simple cause and effect [30:38] so i'm sitting there i have the leash i [30:40] know my dog's gonna react this way [30:42] because my dog has done it before so i'm [30:43] setting my dog up to fail so i can [30:45] correct my dog the exact moment [30:47] he or she makes the wrong choice so i'm [30:49] sitting there this is how i would do it [30:51] she goes to [30:52] bark or act aggressive resource guarding [30:54] me and i would go [30:55] no correction she stops yay good girl [30:59] she goes to bark again [31:00] no correction she stops good she goes to [31:04] bark no correction she stops [31:06] good and then i pet and reward her so [31:09] again that's going to be [31:10] the process that i would take in this [31:12] situation [31:13] because more likely than not the dog [31:15] thinks that that's her responsibility [31:17] and by simply telling her no and giving [31:19] her a correction [31:20] should stop it and should make it go [31:21] away how do i stop my dog from getting [31:24] into other dogs [31:25] fights she can be completely mine in her [31:28] own business but if other dogs start [31:29] fighting [31:30] she'll get in and fight too then again [31:33] this is a situation where i'm going to [31:34] set the dog up to fail if i know the dog [31:36] practices this behavior [31:38] then either i'm going to make sure i [31:39] have my dog on a leash if something does [31:41] happen i'm able to stop her [31:43] before she is able to practice this [31:45] behavior or [31:47] if it was my dog i would do remote [31:49] collar training [31:50] i would make sure i have that off leash [31:52] reliably trained dog [31:53] with the remote collar and then any time [31:55] my dog's in [31:56] an environment where there's other dogs [31:58] and there's a possibility of a dogfight [31:59] breaking out [32:00] if the dogfight does break out i can [32:03] guarantee to get my dog [32:04] over to me prevent my dog from jumping [32:06] into the dog fight and causing any harm [32:08] to herself or the other dogs [32:10] so again remote collar training is going [32:13] to be your friend in a situation like [32:14] this [32:15] where your dog does things when she's [32:18] off leash [32:18] and makes it difficult for you to [32:20] control the off-leash reliability [32:23] comes with that remote collar training [32:25] i'm going to explain [32:26] very quickly how i teach a dog a remote [32:29] collar there are different ways of doing [32:30] this [32:31] this is just a process that i like to do [32:33] it works the best and i've always had [32:35] success with it and i'm able to get a [32:37] dog [32:37] to be obedience trained on a remote [32:40] collar usually pretty fast [32:43] there's two brands that i use if i'm [32:44] using a remote training collar that's [32:46] e-collar technology [32:47] and dogtra i like both of them they're [32:49] both great so if you're going to use one [32:51] pick one that you prefer now if i'm [32:54] using the collar first i have to get the [32:55] dog to be what's known as [32:57] directional to the collar if you're [32:58] using a remote collar for behavioral [33:00] issues that are not based on fear [33:02] you don't have to worry about the dog [33:03] being directional to the collar [33:05] when i say directional i mean the dog [33:07] understands that it's a correction [33:08] coming from you as the human [33:10] if you read a manual it's going to say [33:12] make sure your dog doesn't know that the [33:13] collar or the correction is coming from [33:15] you [33:15] what that means is don't take the remote [33:17] and go i got the [33:18] remote don't make me correct you dog [33:21] that's what it's [33:22] talking about but if you're using it for [33:23] obedience they have to know it's coming [33:26] from you [33:26] they cannot think it's some magical [33:28] thing biting them or pinching them or [33:30] something like that where they don't [33:31] understand where it's coming from it's [33:32] not a bug biting them on the neck they [33:34] have to know it's correction coming from [33:35] you [33:36] but again if it's something that is a [33:38] behavioral issue then i'm not worried [33:39] about them knowing where it comes from i [33:41] want them to associate the correction [33:43] with [33:43] whatever they were doing let me give you [33:44] an example i have a dog that digs all [33:47] the time so i put the remote training [33:48] collar on the dog [33:49] i send the dog out to the yard i watch [33:51] the dog from inside the house [33:53] and i wait till that dog starts to dig [33:55] the moment that dog starts to dig i [33:57] stimulate the collar [33:58] and then i get to be the good guy so the [34:01] dog gets corrected [34:02] and the dog comes running over to me and [34:04] i go what happened [34:05] did that dirt bite you that dirt could [34:08] be mean sometimes [34:09] you better not dig and then the dog [34:11] associates the correction with digging [34:12] stops digging [34:13] easy but when it comes to obedience it's [34:15] a little different if i have a dog in a [34:17] down stay let's say [34:18] and i have the remote collar on the dog [34:20] and i tell the dog to come to me [34:21] and the dog decides not to come to me [34:23] and i just correct the dog [34:25] the dog can't associate anything to that [34:27] correction because the dog was just [34:29] laying there when they're digging they [34:30] can go oh [34:30] digging but if the dog is just lame and [34:33] gets a correction [34:34] the dog can't associate it with anything [34:36] so we have to teach them to be [34:37] directional i followed the same process [34:39] that i talked about earlier when it [34:41] comes to adding corrections within my [34:42] dog's obedience i have to make sure they [34:44] know what [34:44] what's expected they know how to turn [34:46] off pressure by complying and they've [34:48] been given a [34:48] very clear path to success when it comes [34:50] to correcting them i [34:52] pair it with the leash so i have a flat [34:53] collar on and when i go to pop the leash [34:56] i'm making sure i pop it [34:57] at a very light level i don't want to [34:59] pop too hard [35:00] because the correction from the leash [35:01] pop might override the stimulation from [35:04] the remote training collar [35:05] we want the dog to feel the stimulation [35:07] from the remote training collar [35:08] so i tell the dog let's say sit the dog [35:10] decides not to sit i say [35:12] no i lightly pop the leash upward the [35:15] moment i pop the [35:16] leash i press the button on the collar [35:18] giving the dog a correction or [35:19] stimulation from the remote training [35:21] collar [35:21] i pair every correction with the leash [35:23] for the first two weeks [35:25] so the dog breaks the stay i say no i [35:28] pop the leash the moment i pop the leash [35:30] i stimulate the collar [35:31] i recommand the climb whatever it is [35:33] that the dog broke or the down [35:34] and i place the dog back into that [35:36] position so i followed the same [35:38] process that i would if i was just using [35:39] a normal training collar like maybe a [35:41] prong collar and i'm popping the leash [35:44] i usually do this for about two weeks [35:45] after two weeks i take the leash off [35:48] i put the dog on a climb state and i [35:50] wait till the dog breaks the climb stay [35:52] when the dog breaks the climb state i [35:53] say one no i stimulate the collar [35:55] and i watch to see what they do if the [35:58] dog goes back on the climb platform [36:00] or the dog freezes then i know the dog [36:03] is [36:03] more likely than not directional to the [36:05] collar and i can start implementing it [36:07] in my obedience [36:08] i'll also use it when i'm taking the dog [36:10] on a walk they go ahead of me [36:11] i'll say no i'll stimulate the collar [36:13] without popping the leash [36:14] and i'll see how the dog responds if the [36:17] dog comes back into heel position and it [36:19] seems like they knew what they were [36:20] corrected for and they knew how to [36:21] adjust accordingly [36:22] then that shows me the dog is [36:24] directional to the remote training [36:26] collar now we can start using the remote [36:27] training collar on the dog while they're [36:29] off leash and [36:30] getting that full 100 reliably trained [36:33] dog off leash so [36:35] this is the q a video for today i hope [36:37] i've answered a lot of questions giving [36:39] you guys [36:40] a little bit more of a clear path look [36:42] forward to the next one [36:43] again if your question wasn't answered [36:45] in this video it should be in one of the [36:47] following videos because there were [36:49] i

The school he founded is the culmination of that passion, and their students and graduates share his dedication. Over the past four decades, TRS graduated a major percentage of the foremost trainers in the world. Employers snap up at their alumni.  Those who start their own businesses succeed consistently. One very successful graduate put it this way,  “There is no other school with the experience and instructional track record of TRS. There is no other school that teaches many different training techniques, then encourages the student to choose the methods most comfortable for them."" Tom authored three major dog-training books. He won training competitions time after time with dogs he raised and trained. He pioneered and developed the celebrated Puppy Imprinting Program. He coined the phrase ""imprinting"" as it applies to dogs.  He is first to import the Belgian Malinois breed to the United States."

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 113/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another episode at the [00:02] tom rose school here again with [00:04] tom rose today we're going to be [00:05] discussing and they're going to be [00:07] demonstrating [00:08] some of the scent detection training [00:09] that they do here at the school so tom [00:11] how is it that you get the students [00:13] started [00:13] in this course or this this is a [00:15] requirement for the professional program [00:17] as well as the masters correct [00:18] yes and right now what we're going to [00:20] show you is intermediate step [00:22] okay after the the dog has to be sin [00:24] associated he has to [00:25] develop some sort of an indication but [00:28] this is a way that [00:29] again we're drive building we're trying [00:30] to get him excited about [00:32] so very quickly if you don't mind how do [00:34] you start the beginning process if you [00:36] can kind of quickly give me a lot of [00:37] different ways to do it i [00:39] prefer what we call field searches you [00:40] take a dog that really likes to retrieve [00:43] and i'll use a scented tennis ball [00:46] but we've gone as far back as the litter [00:49] box and scented [00:50] uh things in the litter box to crack the [00:53] dog to the scent [00:54] so using pseudo cancane which is a [00:57] liquid [00:58] we found it's a lot of things we can [01:00] send all the toys that he plays with [01:02] that are the ones that we play with him [01:04] with [01:04] and so forth until as he grows older it [01:07] becomes [01:07] very well sin associated at that point [01:11] then we can go ahead and move into [01:12] something like this so right away you [01:14] really want to create that positive [01:16] association from [01:18] odor to reward for the dog right so in [01:20] their mind and they smell that pseudo [01:22] cocaine or whatever odor [01:24] the trainer decides to use because you [01:26] said you also allow the students if they [01:27] want to teach the dog bomb detection [01:29] they could do that [01:30] or they can do uh narcotics detection [01:33] right so whichever one you know it's not [01:35] like the dog's finding [01:36] the pseudo cocaine because it likes [01:38] pseudo cocaine right [01:39] right it's finding the pseudo cocaine [01:41] because it has that positive association [01:42] to the toy [01:43] and dogs love it so much we've actually [01:45] had accidents where people [01:46] walked into my house that had pseudo on [01:49] them or the real cocaine [01:51] and have the dog mall them by the time [01:53] we could get to them [01:54] not hurting them but jumping all over [01:56] trying to get in their pocket and trying [01:58] to get at them [01:59] because they want a reward yeah they [02:00] just their toys like you got my toy [02:02] let's go play [02:03] what are some of the ways that handler [02:05] help can affect the training [02:07] and of course a negative way what does [02:10] handler help there's so many ways it can [02:12] happen for instance i [02:14] judged a narcotics competition one time [02:17] that we [02:17] hid a comb on a car a hair comb [02:21] and almost all the dogs indicated on it [02:24] and that was because during the training [02:26] they had made the mistake of having [02:28] human scent [02:29] on the toys that they were using as a [02:32] reward [02:33] so in addition to being exposed to the [02:35] narcotic scent [02:36] the dog was exposed to the human scent [02:38] and learned to do both [02:40] narcotics work is motivational [02:43] and by motivation i'm referring to [02:46] purely positive motivation as opposed to [02:48] any correction which [02:50] could also be considered motivation [02:51] right but it's not used in doing this [02:53] so the dog is enthusiastic he wants to [02:57] do it and [02:58] they can he can make a lot of mistakes [03:00] and far too many to even discuss here [03:03] right but once again that's why you [03:05] really need to have [03:06] a professional watch you during the [03:08] training because [03:10] as the example of the comb you could [03:12] have [03:13] handlers training dogs to find the wrong [03:15] thing and then you got to figure out how [03:18] to undo the problems that they caused [03:21] of course so and you mentioned the field [03:23] searches and [03:24] in my scent detection series that i have [03:26] on my channel [03:27] i use the field search technique that i [03:29] learned from here [03:30] but one of the questions that was asked [03:32] throughout the video was [03:33] what if you are working with a dog [03:35] that's not toy motivated are there other [03:36] other options that you can use [03:38] you can use food if a dog really likes [03:41] food i [03:42] have had over the years many many police [03:45] departments [03:46] bring me dogs that were not fall [03:48] motivated [03:49] and they wanted me to teach them with [03:50] food and typically what i've done is [03:52] double the price [03:53] because it's going to take me a lot [03:55] longer it's a lot more difficult [03:57] and it can be done but you can still get [03:59] the results using a lot of success [04:01] but i would really prefer to use a toy [04:03] because it's [04:04] so much more exciting i've noticed that [04:07] as well when i went through the course [04:08] i actually had a special toy that i used [04:11] just for scent detection [04:13] right so when we were doing scent [04:14] detection my dog was really excited [04:16] because it was her favorite toy and she [04:17] knew that was part of the game that's [04:19] the only time he got [04:20] exactly the only time so can you tell me [04:22] what do we have back here what's the [04:23] equipment there's some props that we [04:25] like to use [04:27] this is an idea i had many years ago and [04:29] we've been using it ever since [04:31] and what it is is each one of these [04:34] panels [04:35] has four outlets in it and [04:38] we will one day we'll use one hole [04:42] and then we'll clean it out real good [04:44] and the next day we might use a [04:45] different one but you don't want to use [04:47] it over and over in different spots [04:48] because pretty soon the dog's just gonna [04:50] be sticking his head and everyone [04:52] and trying to get an indication and [04:54] where's the odor [04:55] okay we've got these little pieces [04:59] that screw into the side of the tube and [05:01] we can [05:02] put a cotton ball with some scent inside [05:04] here [05:05] the nice thing about pseudo is if you [05:08] use [05:09] isopropyl or rubbing alcohol it totally [05:12] changes the scent of the cocaine to [05:15] something totally different [05:16] so it makes it very easy to clean up so [05:19] we're able to put something in here but [05:21] normally i would use the same one for [05:24] quite a long period of time until i [05:25] can't smell it anymore [05:27] then i'd reset it but it can be moved [05:29] around okay but for any given day [05:31] i would only put it in one hole and then [05:34] i would at the end of the day i'd wipe [05:36] out each tube with isopropyl alcohol [05:38] so when we start the next day there's [05:40] nothing in the way of residual left [05:42] from the day before which can really [05:45] convolute training so [05:46] you have to make sure when the dog's [05:48] coming back to train there's no more [05:49] odor left if you don't want the dog [05:50] indicating another spot that's what the [05:52] alcohol is for cleaning out each one [05:54] making sure there's no [05:55] cross-contamination and so the [05:57] training process is very controlled i [06:00] guess would be a good word yeah [06:01] so we have the dog coming over now how [06:03] does the reward take place the way the [06:04] reward [06:05] does is we can either have a helper or [06:07] sometimes the handlers will reach across [06:10] if the handler reaches across it's very [06:12] important you got the dog [06:13] and this hand you got the ball and this [06:16] hand [06:17] and you have the ball the whole time but [06:20] when the dog [06:21] indicates on the right one the tube is [06:23] long enough in the back that you can [06:25] drop it into the tube [06:26] we call this a a back up search we've [06:29] got the dog in front we're blocking with [06:31] our body [06:32] so we're holding the leash at about a [06:34] foot's length so he's searching and [06:36] we're [06:37] getting to go up and down that's why [06:38] these are different locations [06:40] as we step back when he gets an [06:42] indication [06:44] all you've got to do is turn this to the [06:45] ball slides down the tube and pops out [06:47] for [06:48] him and so you're basically each one [06:50] your body language just like we were [06:51] talking [06:52] about earlier is exactly the same on [06:53] each one yeah and sometimes [06:55] if the dog indicates the wrong one [06:58] uh as he gets further along in the [07:00] training i mean oh good boy is there [07:01] something in there what's [07:02] what you fell in here yeah and there's [07:04] nothing so there's nothing here and then [07:07] he moves down to the next one [07:08] and a lot of times when he hits the [07:10] right one i won't say anything i'll just [07:11] drop the ball [07:12] so then it's showing him he's starting [07:14] to believe that the reward [07:16] is really coming from the scent right so [07:18] maybe he's trying to do a false [07:20] indication because he thinks they're [07:21] going to give him a reward [07:22] right and then he realizes that doesn't [07:23] work the only way i'm getting the reward [07:25] is if i find that specific odor i want [07:27] the dog to actually believe [07:28] i have no idea and so having a helper [07:31] having a helper is probably the best way [07:32] to do it [07:33] if you have a helper but of course [07:35] you're not always going to have a helper [07:36] so you want to have techniques [07:37] to be able to adapt and overcome if [07:39] you're in the situation you still need [07:40] to get the training [07:41] the reverse search pattern is when [07:43] you're beginning to use that what you're [07:44] going to be doing on all your later [07:46] searches [07:47] because you're holding the lead and your [07:49] body is blocking the dog so he doesn't [07:51] get ahead of you [07:52] you want to keep control of the search [07:54] so by blocking [07:55] as he goes around we can point get him [07:58] to go high and low [07:59] as we go around and having at different [08:01] heights this helps when you transition [08:03] the dog from training equipment [08:04] to real life situations we'll talk about [08:06] the boxes in minutes i was about to ask [08:09] low he's going to have trouble with high [08:12] and i've found in actual searches that [08:15] we've done [08:16] we've found narcotics hitting in ceiling [08:19] fans [08:20] and panels up in the ceiling and dogs [08:22] have to learn to be able to do that [08:24] so this is the baby steps this is the [08:26] beginning of it [08:27] yeah i love this i want one of these at [08:29] my house can you come over and build it [08:31] for me tom [08:33] and so what are these containers now [08:35] okay now this [08:36] is a and many times a prelude from doing [08:40] this but i think a lot of times [08:41] people use both each one of these boxes [08:44] is the same [08:45] it's got a tennis ball in it it's got a [08:47] tube in it [08:48] it and it obviously looks the same one [08:51] of them [08:51] has cocaine the others don't the [08:55] uh handler has a button he can push [08:58] when he when the dog finds the correct [09:02] box or the truck scent i think it's in [09:04] this one right now [09:06] the handler pushes the button [09:09] and it pops out and the dog gets it what [09:12] about the ones that have tennis balls do [09:14] you ever find a dog [09:15] just getting stuck because he sees the [09:17] tennis ball yeah if that happens [09:19] we let him obsess about it a little bit [09:22] and then we just kind of pull them away [09:24] from it usually a lot of times [09:26] dogs would do that in the beginning so [09:28] if if they're obsessing over this [09:30] it's like i don't know what you're doing [09:32] come on let's let's go on let's go on to [09:34] the next one [09:35] and when he hits the right one he finds [09:36] it that's what's so neat about this [09:38] because [09:38] i like that that's really cool i'm [09:40] throwing the ball i'm not doing there's [09:41] nothing about me to tell the dog [09:44] that it's there it's just obviously hey [09:46] it pops up [09:47] plus we can take this and we can do we [09:50] call musical chairs where we can switch [09:52] it all up put them in different [09:53] locations [09:54] five here so we got nine different boxes [09:56] we can mix up in any pattern we want [09:59] and because it contains the scent in the [10:02] box [10:02] we don't have to worry about [10:04] contaminating the floor if we [10:06] used to use chairs and we put something [10:08] underneath the chair [10:09] and we found but the scent flows down [10:12] and there would be a scent pool there on [10:14] the floor [10:14] and then when we moved it the dog would [10:16] still indicate there [10:18] but this really addresses that problem [10:21] and prevents that's from happening [10:22] this makes it very controlled which [10:24] brings me to my next question [10:26] what about the indication that again is [10:28] the long [10:30] discussion but i like to start with free [10:32] shaping [10:34] sorry not pre-shaping but shaping i'll [10:36] i'll set up [10:37] something uh and i will try to [10:41] get the dog to indicate where i want him [10:44] to indicate with whatever indication he [10:46] wants [10:47] so if there was a toy that would lead [10:49] him [10:50] to the indication even the scented ball [10:52] probably would be if we started him [10:54] earlier [10:54] we'll wait for him to come up with [10:56] something like we recently had a student [10:58] had a dog with [10:59] spin in circles real fast we don't want [11:01] them barking we don't want them [11:02] scratching [11:03] both of which are real popular behaviors [11:06] for dogs to show us [11:08] but we'll wait for him maybe to sit or [11:11] maybe to throw his body a certain way [11:13] but we wait [11:14] for the dog to come up with something [11:16] and then we reward that behavior [11:18] but we wouldn't begin that here he would [11:22] be using that here but that would be way [11:24] back [11:25] we'll even have a little fenced area [11:27] where we have different things [11:28] we look for the dog to do something [11:30] rewarding for it and we build it [11:33] years ago we did scratching and that was [11:36] real easy to teach [11:37] and then we discovered in doing actual [11:39] searches we were tearing up [11:41] a lot of stuff i was about to ask how [11:42] come they don't teach the scratching [11:44] anymore scratching the car [11:45] and all of a sudden we're paying for a [11:46] paint job so what about the barking why [11:49] not the barking [11:50] the barking again if you go into bomb [11:53] detection [11:54] it could set off a bomb very easily so [11:58] we didn't [11:59] never ever did that but uh we [12:02] if he some sort of ideal indication my [12:06] opinion would be a sip [12:08] but i would like to have the dog's nose [12:10] go as close to the object as possible [12:12] and then we give him the reward when he [12:14] gets his nose over on it [12:16] years ago we would teach the dog using a [12:19] correction [12:20] and make him do a down or make him do a [12:22] sit [12:23] but with students we found they're [12:25] always trying to cut corners [12:27] and so they make corrections to get the [12:30] dog to sit [12:31] and then the dog's over here and he [12:33] finds it he's excited to find it [12:35] also and he gets a correction so the dog [12:38] thinks [12:39] this is no fun i'm not going to do this [12:41] i just get hurt they created an [12:42] avoidance to it then [12:43] yeah so you can't do that so a a good [12:47] trainer or an experienced trainer [12:49] could do a sit and i do that but by the [12:51] time we're doing a search [12:53] all i got to do is say sit and my dog [12:55] has said i don't care where he is [12:57] what is chasing he i can throw a ball on [12:59] his way i'll say sit he'll stop and see [13:02] once he knows it that well yes i can use [13:04] it here it's a real good way to do it [13:05] but we found for [13:07] beginning people it's much better to let [13:09] them [13:10] find some way to solicit to tell you [13:13] where it is and then you have to read [13:14] what they're telling you [13:16] and that's important and i like that you [13:17] were able to point out how [13:19] maybe a more experienced handler is [13:21] going to be able to [13:23] learn at a different way but when you're [13:24] working with someone who's brand new has [13:26] never done any sort of dog training [13:27] whatsoever [13:28] you've learned over your years of [13:30] experience and working with new trainers [13:32] what's the most effective way to get [13:33] them to learn and what's the most [13:35] effective way to get them [13:36] to be able to pass the requirements in [13:38] order to become a certified [13:40] professional doctor we've discovered and [13:41] i brought it out in the book [13:43] is most people with their first dog [13:46] are entirely too correction oriented [13:50] i don't know why it happens that way [13:51] there you would think they'd be less [13:53] likely to make corrections but they're [13:54] not they're much more likely to correct [13:56] make corrections [13:57] much more likely to make harsh [13:59] corrections more likely to get angry [14:01] with the dog [14:02] all kinds of horrible things that do [14:03] nothing but screw the dog up [14:05] after they finish that dog they're [14:07] coming to me why is my set slow why is [14:10] my down slow why [14:12] why does this dog act this way or that i [14:14] said because it's the way you train him [14:15] you made him afraid [14:17] so narcotics is a really good discipline [14:20] even though you may never plan on doing [14:21] it [14:22] it really helps the trainer to learn how [14:24] to read the dog because that's [14:26] exactly what you're doing you're reading [14:28] his signal that there's something here i [14:30] couldn't agree more if you don't mind [14:31] tom can you [14:32] give us a demonstration can we do that [14:34] yeah okay in this case [14:36] we're going to have two hides in the [14:38] wall and one of the box [14:41] normally we wouldn't have that many in [14:43] such a area small [14:44] area but we did that for purposes of [14:46] demonstration [14:48] okay go ahead search [14:52] i want the dog to stick his nose in and [14:54] smell each one [15:03] mark [15:07] yay good girl normally i would have [15:09] asked kelvin to already [15:11] be behind the wall so you wouldn't have [15:13] to go you wouldn't necessarily want to [15:15] stand directly behind this one yeah [15:17] but in the area so on the next one he'll [15:20] be in the area so we can [15:22] the reward that time was a little too [15:24] slow in coming [15:25] okay search [15:30] search search search [15:33] you've found it already mark [15:37] yeah good girl good job [15:40] and you notice the dog is fixated on the [15:43] exact [15:44] hole where the dog is the ball out [15:47] that's exactly what we want to have [15:48] happen [15:49] search now we're doing the boxes and i [15:52] always thought this was a fun one [15:54] he found it mark hey [15:58] good job so go get it i think for the [16:01] dog that's [16:01] very exciting because the dog the ball [16:03] is animated [16:04] so here the dog did a very good job as [16:06] we say this would be a beginning [16:08] to an immediate step in training but the [16:11] dog was definitely [16:13] associated he did the right thing [16:15] continued through the search [16:16] one thing i might mention and we've done [16:19] a lot of searches of schools and prisons [16:21] and various things [16:23] one of the big differences between our [16:24] training situation [16:26] and the real thing is say you're [16:28] searching the prison [16:30] you might go 10 or 15 minutes with no [16:32] fines at all [16:33] so as we finish a dog we that is our [16:36] focus is to get the dog to work for a [16:39] really long period of time without [16:40] getting rewarded [16:41] and not burning out thank you again tom [16:43] this has been such a pleasure [16:45] that dog was really excellent and to be [16:48] able to see the dog come out and to have [16:49] that energy and the excitement to be [16:51] able to train [16:52] you can see that the process has been [16:53] done correctly right cause just like you [16:55] said [16:55] the dog got to the odor you could see [16:57] the dog continue to look at that odor [16:59] waiting for the reward exactly how you [17:01] explained earlier [17:02] and you said this is around intermediate [17:04] level beginning [17:06] intermediate and the neat thing about it [17:08] is the dog was enthusiastic he really [17:10] enjoyed it [17:11] this is so much fun for the dog to be [17:13] able to do this and that's what we want [17:14] and that's the best and one of my [17:15] favorite quotes you would always say is [17:17] dog training is supposed to be fun [17:18] yeah it should be for both the hand or [17:20] the dog you should put a smile on your [17:22] face [17:23] you're the wrong person you got the [17:25] wrong dog one of the times i agree so [17:27] hey everybody i hope you guys enjoyed [17:29] today's video [17:30] as always like subscribe hit the [17:32] notification bell in the description

This is a tool that we can use to help communicate more clearly what we would like from our dogs. This is not meant to be used as punishment or any form of intimidation. The process is simple. 1) First get your dog used to the heeling stick by petting them with it while providing treat rewards and praise. 2) Start with the pressure first and once your dog moves in the desired direction, mark and reward. Pro Tip: We can make this process easier by using something the dog already knows to get them to quickly learn this concept. It will go like this: • First, apply pressure. • Next, after the pressure has been applied, then you will use luring to guide your dog into the desired position. For example; we want to use the heeling stick to get the dog into the down position, so we would apply pressure first. Once the dog feels the pressure, we would then lure the dog into the down with a piece of food. This will help teach the dog the heeling stick—which occurs because whatever comes first is what you are teaching your dog. So, in this situation—it’s the heeling stick. • Turn the pressure off. • Mark and reward.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 117/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode today we're going to be going [00:03] over a healing stick [00:04] i have two depending on what exercise [00:06] you're going to be doing will depend if [00:08] you need one healing stick or if you [00:09] need to [00:10] first we have to teach our dog what the [00:12] healing stick is and how they have to [00:13] respond to it [00:14] we're going to be implementing negative [00:15] reinforcement this is not for [00:17] positive punishment this is not for [00:19] corrections it's one more way we can [00:21] communicate to our dog what we want and [00:23] what we expect from them [00:24] and this is usually often used more so [00:26] for precision style obedience [00:29] and for a focused heal when i say [00:32] negative reinforcement [00:33] what this means is we turn pressure on [00:35] when they comply we turn the pressure [00:36] off [00:37] we use negative reinforcement when we [00:38] use leash pressure remember this is not [00:41] a correction [00:41] easy way to remember negative means [00:43] taking away positive means adding [00:46] reinforcement means encouraging a [00:48] behavior to be repeated [00:49] so negative reinforcement the pressure's [00:51] turned on when they comply we turn it [00:52] off [00:53] we have to teach them how to respond the [00:54] way i like to start that is by using a [00:57] place bowl [00:57] i'm gonna have ari put her paws on the [00:59] bowl and then i'm gonna use the stick [01:01] i'm gonna have both of them together but [01:03] you can use just one for this exercise [01:05] and i'm gonna tap either side of her hip [01:07] and that's going to be the direction i [01:08] want her to go [01:09] so if i push on her left hip that i want [01:12] her to shift to the right [01:13] if i push on her right hip then i want [01:15] her to shift to the left [01:16] this helps when you're doing focused [01:18] heel for the left about turn [01:20] it also helps if your dog has a tendency [01:22] to be a little wide or crab walk as they [01:24] call it where they're walking [01:26] on a slight angle so this is going to [01:28] help clean up some of those issues that [01:29] you may be having [01:30] this also helps with the backwards [01:32] follow exercise and the sit front [01:34] position [01:34] and i'll show you what i mean by that [01:36] you're going to want to make sure your [01:37] dog knows the place [01:39] and you can see that i pointed to the [01:41] place and that got her to come over to [01:42] it it's some of the other stuff i've [01:43] been working on with her [01:45] this is again like i said a form of [01:46] communication whatever comes first is [01:49] what you're teaching your dog so when [01:50] you're teaching them this [01:51] if you need to help them learn by luring [01:53] or doing something else [01:55] you can do that just make sure the [01:56] pressure from the stick comes first [01:59] so i'm going to start by doing the [02:00] pressure oh something i forgot [02:02] you also want to get them used to it i [02:04] like to just pet them and reward them [02:06] with the healing stick [02:07] while i'm petting them you don't have to [02:09] mark or do anything like that you just [02:10] want to make sure they're comfortable [02:12] being around the healing stick so what [02:15] i'm going to do is i'm going to place it [02:16] on her [02:17] side boom she pivots i mark and reward [02:20] or just reward yes good girl we're not [02:23] asking for a lot [02:24] just a little bit she feels it she takes [02:26] a step to the side she feels it [02:28] yes she takes a step to the side and [02:29] that's why it's negative reinforcement [02:31] you see the pressure's turned on [02:33] once she complies the pressure's turned [02:34] off [02:40] three she gets a little excited and she [02:42] barks sometimes [02:43] alright go climb now i worked with her [02:46] already on this but this might take a [02:48] little bit first time you're doing it [02:49] you're gonna find you're putting [02:50] pressure [02:51] and the dog's not pivoting if that's the [02:53] case you can use your food lure [02:55] to help get your dog to pivot their back [02:56] end but like i said make sure the [02:58] pressure from the stick [03:00] comes first now with the backwards [03:02] follow exercise [03:04] i'm simply going to hold both of them in [03:06] front of me and i want my dog to walk in [03:07] between them [03:08] this is one way we can help keep our dog [03:10] straight when we're doing the sit front [03:12] exercise [03:12] of course you want to make sure your dog [03:14] already knows the sit front and nose [03:16] come when called so we're going to say [03:18] come and we're going to walk backwards [03:20] and you can see this is helping her stay [03:22] straight [03:24] oh sorry ari i messed up [03:27] free good girl mark and then we give her [03:30] a reward [03:31] i go climb with heel [03:34] i like to have one in the front and one [03:36] on the side the one on the side [03:37] is going to help with her back end if i [03:40] need her to pivot [03:41] to the right this is going to be very [03:42] helpful when we're doing our left about [03:45] turns [03:45] we can also use it for our right about [03:47] turns [03:48] what i'll do for that is every time i'm [03:51] starting to do the right about turn [03:53] i you shush it young lady i will bring [03:56] the healing stick to the right as i'm [03:58] turning as a cue for my dog to let her [04:01] know [04:01] we're going to be turning to the right [04:03] so again these are all just different [04:04] ways we can communicate [04:06] with our dog i also like them to walk [04:08] backwards when they feel the pressure on [04:09] their chest [04:10] you have to make sure you can get your [04:11] dog to walk backwards first she knows to [04:14] walk backwards when she's in the heel [04:15] position [04:16] all i'm going to do for this is i'm [04:17] going to walk with her and heal i will [04:19] apply the pressure [04:20] then i will walk backwards once she [04:23] walks backwards with me [04:24] i mark and reward and you're going to [04:26] see i'm going to use it as well when we [04:28] do the left about turn [04:29] i keep the stick in the front to prevent [04:31] her from forging then i use the one on [04:33] the side [04:34] to help her if she needs a little bit of [04:36] guidance pivoting her back [04:37] and around to make sure she maintains [04:39] that perfect heel position [04:41] while doing a difficult left about turn [04:44] so we're going to call her in the heel [04:45] our heel that's not that's not heel [04:49] our heel that's better so heel we're [04:52] going to walk forwards [04:53] there's the pressure and then oh good [04:56] girl [05:00] very nice much better [05:05] and we'll do the look about so fast [05:08] good and then the right [05:12] you see how what i do is [05:16] good down go climb [05:19] free i'm sorry it might be a little hard [05:22] to hear she's very enthusiastic [05:24] about training what i was doing if you [05:26] didn't see it [05:27] was i was simply like i said applying [05:29] the pressure then walking backwards [05:30] same thing with the left about turn just [05:32] having that there is going to help [05:34] prevent your dog from being wide [05:35] so once again this is just a tool that [05:37] we can use to communicate to our dog [05:40] we can also use this for different [05:41] things such as using it to have our dog [05:44] sit by [05:45] placing it on the back end once they sit [05:47] we turn the pressure off mark and reward [05:49] we can also do it on their shoulder [05:51] blades down [05:53] free what i did right there was i said [05:55] down but you notice i started the [05:57] pressure first [05:58] if your dog doesn't know to go with the [06:00] pressure on something we can use [06:01] something that they already know [06:02] in order to help teach them to go with [06:05] the pressure so for this [06:06] it becomes a predictable pattern every [06:08] time i place the stick on her shoulder [06:10] blades [06:10] i then say down after enough of those [06:14] she'll feel that pressure and she'll lay [06:15] down sit or you can do [06:17] a different form of a physical cue you [06:20] could point to the ground [06:22] i sit you could point and then say down [06:26] after enough of those you point to the [06:27] ground boom your dog lays down [06:29] this is also very helpful if you have a [06:31] hard time [06:32] you know doing down a bunch of times we [06:35] can use this [06:36] for the training process by implementing [06:38] this in a combination [06:40] with leash pressure so again very simple [06:43] the concept is to get your dog to go [06:45] with the pressure not to push into it [06:48] just like leash pressure work and it's [06:49] one more way we can communicate as [06:52] clearly as possible with our dogs [06:53] because [06:54] really that's what dog training is it's [06:55] being able to communicate with our dogs [06:57] in a timely manner when they're right [06:59] and when they're wrong [07:00] i hope you guys enjoyed today's

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 122/841,org and [03:04] without even contacting the breeder [03:05] you should be able to search a couple of [03:07] their dog's name in their database [03:09] and the health testing will pop up so [03:11] it's a good way to be able to [03:13] kind of fact check the breeder to make [03:15] sure that their health testing is being [03:16] done [03:17] with that being said if i have a dog [03:19] named [03:20] pluto his registered name might be [03:23] jumping over the moon [03:24] so make sure you know what the [03:26] registered name is because pluto may not [03:28] show up on that database [03:30] but it's because you're looking for the [03:32] wrong dog not necessarily because they [03:33] didn't do that [03:34] testing so number one is health testing [03:37] number two [03:37] find out what their goals of their [03:39] breeding program is [03:41] and their goal of their breeding program [03:42] should match your goal [03:44] of what you're looking for in your next [03:46] dog so if i'm looking for a dog that [03:48] does search and rescue [03:49] i'm going to find a breeder that breeds [03:52] dogs that will do well in search and [03:53] rescue which means they have to be [03:55] environmentally confident they have to [03:56] be comfortable walking on different [03:57] surfaces [03:58] they can't be shy of loud noises they [04:00] have to be friendly with people and they [04:01] have to be motivated [04:03] so without saying i'm looking for a [04:04] search and rescue dog i want to ask them [04:07] what kind of dogs do you produce if they [04:09] are giving me qualities that would make [04:11] a good search and rescue dog then i can [04:13] after i've asked them that question then [04:15] i can tell them i'm looking for a dog [04:16] for search and rescue [04:18] have any of your dogs done that before [04:20] and then they can tell you yes or no [04:21] just because a dog a breeder hasn't [04:23] produced search and rescue dogs doesn't [04:25] mean that a puppy can't [04:26] but if you want a sure thing it's better [04:28] to find a breeder [04:29] that has produced that if you are [04:31] looking for a family pet [04:33] i want to make sure that i ask the [04:35] breeder how are your dogs with kids [04:38] if they are shy with kids if they bark [04:40] at kids that's probably not a breeder [04:41] that [04:42] i'm going to choose to be my family pet [04:44] when i'm looking for a family pet i'm [04:45] looking for a dog that doesn't the [04:47] parents don't have any [04:49] resource with or issues with resource [04:51] guarding i want to make sure that [04:52] they're confident and they're friendly [04:54] they're not aggressive if when people [04:55] come to the door because most families [04:57] will have [04:58] a very busy household so just make sure [05:00] that the goals of the breeder align with [05:02] your goals in terms of what you're [05:03] looking for [05:04] in a dog so when i'm also looking for a [05:06] breeder i don't like to pick out my own [05:08] puppies [05:09] i like the breeder to pick the puppy for [05:11] me good breeders will not let you pick [05:14] up [05:14] pick out their puppy or your puppy so if [05:17] i [05:17] am looking for a dog most good breeders [05:20] will have like a puppy matchmaker or a [05:22] questionnaire [05:22] that you will fill out it's almost [05:25] impossible for me to [05:26] evaluate a litter and pick a puppy with [05:29] spending [05:29] 20 minutes with them if i'm looking for [05:32] a [05:32] dog for detection i want a dog that's [05:36] bouncing off the wall's energy and will [05:37] do anything for a ball or food [05:40] if i go and visit the litter and the [05:42] puppies have been running around for an [05:44] hour and maybe there's only [05:45] one puppy that still has energy i would [05:47] go oh that's the best puppy i want this [05:49] one [05:50] well maybe that one wasn't running [05:52] around with all the other puppies and [05:53] this one is actually the sleeper [05:55] and when the breeder was playing with [05:56] them that one was taking a nap and now [05:58] the active ones are sleeping because [05:59] they've been playing for the last hour [06:01] so now the sleeper seems like he has the [06:03] most energy so it's almost impossible to [06:05] go [06:06] and visit a breeder for 15 minutes even [06:08] an hour and have a good idea of [06:09] temperament [06:10] a good breeder will spend a lot of time [06:13] with the puppies for the first [06:14] eight weeks so it's they have the best [06:16] idea in terms of [06:18] temperament and personality [06:21] the other thing with puppies is they [06:22] change a lot so there's certain [06:24] temperament tests like the vollard test [06:26] that is supposed to give you a good idea [06:28] that's done at seven and a half weeks [06:30] that checks sociability the dog's desire [06:32] to retrieve [06:34] their physical sensitivity their pack [06:35] drive it's supposed to test all of those [06:37] things [06:38] well based on the research it really [06:41] isn't [06:41] a predictor of future temperament the [06:45] earliest that i think the research has [06:46] been done that shows [06:48] real future temperament predictions it's [06:50] done around four to five months [06:52] most breeders aren't going to hold on to [06:53] their dogs until four to five months [06:56] a good breeder will also not let their [06:57] puppies go home before eight weeks [07:00] during those first eight weeks the [07:02] puppies need to learn [07:04] communication with each other and also [07:06] they learn a lot from the mom [07:07] so i want to make sure that the breeder [07:09] is not letting their puppies go before [07:11] eight weeks [07:12] so the breeder should pick the puppy for [07:14] you have some kind of a matchmaker and [07:15] it shouldn't be [07:16] based on a list of well i have the first [07:18] deposit down so i get first pick [07:20] that used to be the way that it was but [07:22] now good breeders they're not doing that [07:24] anymore [07:25] the other reason why i personally don't [07:27] let people pick their own puppies [07:28] is because people pick based on looks as [07:31] well [07:31] well looks will change and golden [07:34] retrievers puppies tend to start really [07:35] light and they get darker when they get [07:37] older [07:38] in my breed they start really dark they [07:40] get lighter and then they get darker [07:42] some people will pick the puppy because [07:44] he has a little white on his foot or a [07:45] little white on his chest [07:47] well that's not going to make you make [07:50] this puppy a good pet for you [07:52] temperament behavior genetics all of [07:54] that stuff is important [07:55] so because people are automatically [07:57] drawn like i personally love the color [07:59] red so i'm always drawn [08:01] with a puppy with a red collar i know [08:02] that personal preference so if i'm going [08:04] to keep a puppy out of one of my litters [08:06] none of the puppies get red collars so [08:07] that way i don't [08:09] pick based on color so a good breeder [08:11] will also have a contract [08:12] on that contract it'll have the dog's [08:15] information the registration number [08:17] microchip and then it will also have [08:21] all of the different scenarios that may [08:22] occur in the dog's life so [08:24] if for whatever reason the buyer or the [08:26] new puppy owner cannot keep the puppy [08:28] what happens to the puppy [08:30] in my situation or good breeder [08:32] situation they will always take their [08:34] dogs back [08:35] not giving a refund is not necessarily a [08:38] sign of a bad breeder [08:41] but they will always take their puppies [08:43] back so don't expect to get a refund if [08:45] you have to give your puppy back [08:46] but the breeder should always take the [08:48] puppy back good breeders won't litter [08:50] they won't have their puppies ever go to [08:52] a shelter [08:52] in my contract it says if for any reason [08:56] you are unable to keep the puppy the pup [08:58] either comes back to me [08:59] or if you have a good friend the puppy [09:01] can also go to the other person they [09:02] don't have to come back to me [09:04] but they're never allowed to go to a [09:05] rescue or end up in an animal shelter [09:08] the other thing that should be in the [09:09] contract is spay and neuter if that is [09:12] something that they want to do [09:13] but not a premature span neuter [09:16] so mo a lot of vets are still [09:18] recommending pediatric spays and neuters [09:21] and it is not recommended anymore in [09:23] terms of [09:24] physical developmental and developmental [09:27] mentally [09:28] so in my contract personally dogs aren't [09:31] allowed to be [09:32] spayed or neutered until at least a year [09:34] and a half two years is ideal [09:36] if they spare a neuter too early my [09:38] health contract is void [09:39] because if you spay a neuter at seven [09:42] weeks of age [09:43] the bone there's been research done [09:44] where the dogs actually grow [09:46] unproportionally and they have more [09:48] tension [09:49] and more issues with like soft tissue [09:51] tears ccl issues and things like that [09:53] so it's not ideal to neuter before a [09:55] year and a half if you're going to [09:56] neuter it all [09:57] with that being said a good breeder will [09:59] also have stipulations on you breeding [10:01] your dog [10:02] so just because you leave them intact [10:03] does not necessarily mean that you [10:05] should breed your dog [10:06] so in my case if you're going to have [10:09] breeding rights on your dog [10:11] the dog has to be titled in a dog sport [10:13] you have to have your health testing [10:14] done [10:15] and whatever dog you breed with also has [10:17] to be titled and have health testing [10:19] done [10:20] and for me that's the bare minimum in [10:22] terms of what to look for [10:24] when you're breeding the dog so i don't [10:26] just let everybody breed their dogs but [10:28] i also don't make [10:29] them spay or neuter their dogs you have [10:31] to be responsible about it [10:33] if you don't trust the breeder and the [10:35] breeder doesn't trust you [10:36] in terms of keeping your dog intact or [10:38] not neutering then you probably [10:40] shouldn't get a dog from them [10:41] avoid any breeders that spay and neuter [10:45] before you get the dog especially but if [10:47] they have a stipulation saying that you [10:49] have to spay or neuter by six months [10:51] find somebody else if you're looking for [10:53] a pet it still matters [10:55] because again if you're playing the [10:57] backyard and a dog twists and turns [10:59] playing ball they're more likely to get [11:00] that ccl tear if they were spayed and [11:02] neutered too young [11:03] another thing that you want to look for [11:05] in the contract [11:06] is just some kind of a health guarantee [11:09] saying that the dog has given been given [11:11] age-appropriate vaccinations that [11:13] they're healthy maybe even had a vet [11:15] check them over before they go [11:16] and if they've had any kind of [11:18] dewormings [11:20] there's certain things that are very [11:22] very common that a lot of puppy buyers [11:24] freak out about especially in california [11:26] we have a lot of giardia a puppy testing [11:28] positive for giardia is does not mean [11:30] that the breeder is a bad breeder [11:32] it's very common and it's very easily [11:34] treated [11:35] but a lot of veterinarians will tell the [11:38] breeders that the puppy came from a [11:40] dirty breeder [11:41] but it actually just comes from water so [11:43] if one puppy steps in [11:44] poop and then tracks its way and sticks [11:46] his paws in the water bowl which a lot [11:47] of them do [11:48] that's how you can get giardia so it [11:50] doesn't mean that the puppy has been [11:52] neglected or abused [11:53] giardia is very common so some kind of a [11:55] health certificate some kind of [11:56] or some kind of health guarantee all the [12:00] information's for the parents [12:02] [Music] [12:05] so red flags what to look out for you [12:08] don't want [12:09] a breeder who sends their dogs home [12:11] before eight weeks of age [12:13] if it's a couple days because it's a [12:14] weekend they want to make sure that you [12:15] have time with the puppy [12:16] that's okay but nothing earlier than [12:19] seven and a half weeks [12:21] like at the absolute minimum i also [12:24] don't like to get my puppy for me [12:26] because i do work i don't like to get [12:28] them [12:29] past 13 weeks of age unless the breeder [12:31] is doing a great job socializing them [12:33] because dog's key socialization period [12:35] is up to 13 weeks [12:36] if you're looking for a pet dog and the [12:38] breeder is doing all of their homework [12:40] and is really working with the dog then [12:41] that can be a great advantage waiting [12:43] until after their key socialization [12:44] period [12:45] because the breeder is basically doing a [12:47] lot of your homework for you [12:48] but if the breeder is not doing their [12:50] homework and you get the dog after 13 [12:53] weeks of age they've never left the [12:54] backyard [12:55] they've never had anybody come over they [12:57] don't do anything with the puppies [12:58] that's a big red flag because that's [13:00] going to be big problems for you later [13:03] another red flag is breeders who say [13:05] that health testing [13:06] is the fact that their vet checked them [13:08] over and said that they're healthy [13:09] that's not health testing [13:10] yes that's good that they're healthy but [13:12] that does not make them a breeding [13:14] quality [13:15] dog another red flag for me is any kind [13:18] of fearfulness [13:19] there's no reason to be breeding fearful [13:21] dogs [13:23] if you're looking for a pet or a working [13:25] dog if i have a dog that is nervous of [13:27] people [13:28] in my opinion it does not need to be [13:30] bred i want confident happy no matter [13:32] what you're looking for you want a [13:33] confident happy dog [13:34] another red flag would be a really [13:37] simple if you go and see the litter [13:39] or you're talking to the breeder on the [13:41] phone and the puppies are [13:43] eight weeks or almost eight weeks ask [13:45] when when was last time they had their [13:47] nails trimmed [13:48] so backyard breeders a lot of times [13:50] don't trim their nails they don't think [13:51] about it they don't handle their dogs [13:53] that often they're not getting scratched [13:54] up they obviously just don't care [13:56] good breeders will be trimming their [13:57] nails pretty often that also leads [13:59] itself into dogs that are used to being [14:01] handled [14:02] if the puppies are used to being handled [14:03] and used to having their nails done [14:05] again that's one less thing that you [14:06] have to worry about because the dog has [14:08] already been desensitized to that kind [14:09] of handling [14:10] another thing to look out for is if the [14:13] breeder [14:13] wants to just meet you at a parking lot [14:17] if they refuse [14:18] to face time with you so you can see [14:20] where the dogs are kept [14:21] or you're not able to meet the parents [14:24] that's a red flag [14:25] not every breed the parents are friendly [14:27] with strangers outside of the family [14:29] like if i'm going to look for [14:31] a boerboel breeder a rottweiler breeder [14:33] any of the really protective breeds king [14:35] corso's [14:36] i don't expect to be able to pet mom and [14:37] dad but i would like to at least be able [14:39] to see them [14:40] if they will not let me see them i'll [14:41] ask oh why [14:43] why do you say that if they say [14:46] it's because i'm worried right now with [14:48] coronavirus okay let's facetime [14:50] i like to be able to see them if they [14:52] won't show you the dogs i'll pass on [14:54] that for me that's a red flag [14:56] if the person doesn't want strangers [14:58] come into their house i totally [14:59] understand again you should be able to [15:00] facetime [15:01] and at least see the dogs and that'll [15:03] kind of give you an idea [15:04] if you have any kind of a bad feeling or [15:07] a bad [15:08] intuition listen to it past that breeder [15:11] there's always somebody else there's [15:12] always going to be another litter [15:14] a lot of times those intuitions are [15:16] there or that kind of bad feeling is [15:18] there for a reason [15:19] always listen to your gut another thing [15:22] is if the breeder hasn't done any [15:24] deworming if they haven't done [15:26] any vaccinations ask them why some the [15:28] breeders now are following [15:31] gene dr gene dodd's protocols which [15:33] which call for later vaccinations which [15:35] is fine but i want to know [15:36] are they actually following that or are [15:38] they just saving money because they [15:39] don't want to spend the money [15:40] on vaccinating their litter another red [15:43] flag is no papers [15:45] if the litter doesn't come with [15:47] registration papers that usually means [15:49] that the parents [15:50] do not have breeding rights and if the [15:51] parents don't have breeding rights that [15:53] means that [15:54] the breeder is not responsible not [15:56] reputable pass on it [15:57] when you actually go visit the puppies [15:59] look at the puppies are they [16:01] dirty do they smell do they look healthy [16:04] is their coat dull or dry [16:06] are they kept in clean conditions do [16:07] they look happy take all of those things [16:09] in consideration [16:11] other red flags would be also the [16:13] condition of the parents how often are [16:15] they breeding [16:16] a lot of people think that breeding back [16:18] to back is a bad thing [16:20] but now reproduction specialists are [16:21] actually saying it's physically better [16:23] for the female dog [16:25] to breed back to back and then spay when [16:26] you're finished so find out if they are [16:29] having multiple litters [16:30] why are they having multiple litters if [16:32] they say oh because it's actually the [16:34] best thing for the female and they know [16:35] the why [16:36] then that's okay if they're having back [16:38] to back litters because they want more [16:40] money from the puppies again red flag [16:42] pass look at the price too cheap [16:46] is usually a problem too expensive can [16:49] also be a problem [16:51] find out what the average price is and [16:54] and get a feel why do you charge that [16:56] much for your puppies [16:58] if the puppies are very expensive [17:00] because they have all kinds of health [17:01] testing [17:02] and they do all kinds of stuff with them [17:04] then that money is worth it up front [17:06] it's better to spend [17:07] more money up front for a well-bred [17:09] puppy than to go for a cheaper breeder [17:12] and then have to spend more money on [17:14] veterinary bills and training later [17:16] another red flag are breeders breeding [17:18] for color or off standard [17:21] colors so a really popular thing right [17:24] now [17:25] like a very popular breed that's a good [17:27] example are french bulldogs [17:29] french bulldogs do not naturally come in [17:32] merle [17:32] other disqualifying colors like in [17:35] france are the blue dogs or the gray [17:37] dogs the dilute with the silver [17:38] the gray nose anybody who is breeding [17:41] for color [17:42] is generally not breeding for [17:44] temperament so if they're breeding [17:46] silver labs merle french bulldogs [17:49] anything that's not [17:50] standard white german shepherds white [17:53] dobermans anything like that [17:55] pass on it there are certain colors that [17:58] pop up [17:58] naturally but if you are getting [18:02] for example the blue color which is [18:04] essentially dilute black [18:06] if you have two fawn dogs that carry [18:08] that blue color [18:09] even though they're both healthy both to [18:11] help test it and everything [18:12] they can still produce a blue puppy it's [18:15] what the breeder does with that blue [18:16] puppy [18:16] is what tells me if the breeder is [18:18] reputable or not [18:20] if that blue puppy who is [18:23] in terms of the standard undesirable [18:26] again totally fine as a pet but [18:27] undesirable [18:28] a good breeder will not sell that puppy [18:31] with breeding rights [18:32] a breeder that's selling that selling [18:35] puppies for the wrong reason [18:37] they will sell that blue puppy for even [18:39] more money because it's rare [18:41] so don't buy from a breeder who breeds [18:44] rare colored dogs because a lot of times [18:46] temperament and health will go out the [18:48] window because that's not what their [18:50] goals are their breeding program their [18:52] breeding [18:52] pro their breeding is for appearance [18:56] but it's non-standard so avoid that [18:58] that's another big red flag that's very [19:00] popular right now [19:02] [Music] [19:04] so when you're looking for a breeder not [19:06] every breeder is going to be within [19:08] close driving distance [19:09] and shipping may be necessary not every [19:13] breeder will ship puppies most puppies [19:16] when they're small enough [19:17] will fit under your seat and be able to [19:19] ride with you on the airplane [19:20] so if you have talked to the breeder [19:22] you're in love with the breeder you [19:25] have a good litter that you're [19:26] interested in you have your deposit down [19:28] fly out and go pick up your puppy [19:30] there's lots of good [19:31] ground transport that is also available [19:34] now i say good ground transport because [19:36] there's also lots of horror stories [19:38] so make sure whatever ground transport [19:40] that you choose [19:42] you do a lot of research you talk to [19:44] other clients that have had good [19:46] experiences [19:46] and find out that's the right choice for [19:48] you i'm very fortunate i have a really [19:50] good local [19:51] company called four-legged kids pet [19:53] transport that i use whenever i have [19:55] shipping [19:56] so i'm very fortunate that they're local [19:57] and they do a great job [19:59] so it's not a red flag if a breeder [20:01] won't ship [20:03] but me as a either buyer or a breeder [20:07] you should be able to figure out a way [20:08] to get a puppy [20:09] avoid shipping puppies unless you've [20:11] been able to facetime and you've really [20:13] have a good relationship with the [20:14] breeder avoid from [20:16] puppy mill states not every dog that's [20:19] born in missouri [20:20] is a puppy mill dog but there's a lot of [20:22] really loose regulations in missouri so [20:24] there are [20:25] lots of puppy mills so if i'm looking [20:27] for a teacup [20:28] maltese i'm not going to buy one from [20:29] missouri always i'm less likely to [20:32] because they're more likely again [20:34] they're breeding for an abnormal size [20:37] and it's coming from a state that is [20:40] more prone to have [20:41] puppy mills so if you are shipping a [20:43] puppy and you're not able to go visit [20:45] make sure that you're able to facetime [20:47] talk to the breeder get video live don't [20:50] have them send pictures get live video [20:52] if they're not willing to do live video [20:54] again red flag pass but there's no [20:57] problem with shipping a puppy as long as [20:58] you [20:59] trust the breeder they've done their [21:00] health testing you've done your research [21:02] you have a good relation to them [21:03] you've seen the live video of the [21:04] puppies and if everything else checks [21:06] out [21:06] there's no problem with shipping [21:09] [Music] [21:11] so another thing a lot of owners may [21:14] view as a red flag which is actually a [21:16] really good thing that some breeders [21:18] will do [21:18] is they will retire their breeding dogs [21:20] into [21:21] different forever homes so if you're not [21:25] going to become a hoarder [21:26] when the dog is retired from your [21:28] breeding program in my opinion [21:30] it's better to find that dog a home [21:33] where they will be the center of a [21:34] family's universe [21:35] than be one of many so if a if you're [21:38] looking for [21:39] a reputable breeder but you're not [21:41] looking for a puppy [21:43] feel free to reach out to a breeder that [21:44] you find and find out if you ever have a [21:46] dog that is retired from your breeding [21:48] program [21:49] do you have a waiting list for those [21:50] adult dogs those adult dogs [21:52] are usually health tested they [21:56] are socialized they're usually already [21:58] well trained and they're usually [22:00] not very expensive and they still have a [22:03] lot of years left on them so you get all [22:04] the benefits of [22:05] getting a dog from a good breeder good [22:08] genetics good training good early [22:10] upbringing [22:11] without spending a fortune so if you [22:13] want to skip the [22:14] the bitey puppy chewy training phase [22:17] click [22:17] cleaning up accidents getting a retired [22:19] dog from a good breeder is also a great [22:21] option [22:23] [Music] [22:25] so if you decide to not get a dog or [22:28] puppy from a breeder but you'd like to [22:30] adopt a puppy from a rescue or the [22:32] shelter [22:34] what you're looking for is essentially [22:36] the same minus the health testing [22:39] and you don't really know genetically [22:40] what the dog is so [22:42] there's some simple tests that you can [22:43] do to find out if this dog [22:45] is good for you so if you're going to [22:48] the shelter [22:49] usually i'll just do a walk through [22:51] first a [22:53] simple test that i learned from uh sue [22:56] sternberg is you walk up to the kennel [22:59] and you go hi puppy hi puppy hi puppy hi [23:01] puppy and you see if they follow your [23:03] hand [23:04] the puppy that follows your hand and [23:06] kissy kissy kissy kissy kissy kissy [23:07] kissy kissy [23:08] is showing social social behavior [23:11] the dog that tries to bite your fingers [23:13] when you're sticking them through [23:14] you know is a little bit playful the dog [23:16] that's barking at you and hitting the [23:18] fence [23:19] is probably gonna need some work if [23:20] you're going to adopt them the dog that [23:23] tucks his tail and goes to the back of [23:24] the kennel or doesn't approach you again [23:26] is not showing social behavior [23:28] so a really fast way to narrow down your [23:30] search walk up to all the kennels hi [23:32] bubby hi puppy hi puppy hi puppy [23:34] the puppy that follows your hand loose [23:36] waggy and is happy to see you [23:38] that will narrow your search anybody [23:40] who's showing any other behavior [23:42] i'm going to pass on that does not mean [23:45] that if you get them out of the kennel [23:47] they're not good dogs [23:48] some dogs just don't show well but if [23:51] you are at the shelter [23:52] looking for a good family pet pick a dog [23:55] that's easy [23:56] don't pick a problem some shelters the [23:58] dogs won't come with any kind of [23:59] background information so you're just [24:01] seeing them for what they are [24:02] so maybe they were neglected maybe they [24:04] were abused maybe they just were never [24:06] socialized [24:07] maybe they lived in a backyard their [24:08] whole life maybe they had lots of [24:11] practice being aggressive or they were [24:12] somebody's baby but they just moved [24:15] you don't always know so what you're [24:16] looking at is the dog right in front of [24:18] you [24:18] so the dog right in front of me again i [24:20] don't want fearful i don't want [24:22] aggressive [24:22] i want a dog that's friendly and social [24:24] so that's a really easy test [24:26] is see if the dog follows your hand see [24:28] if they approach see if they lick see [24:29] how their reaction is to you [24:31] obviously don't stick your fingers in [24:32] the kennel with an aggressive dog you [24:33] can put your hand flat [24:34] it's more about just seeing do they [24:36] follow your social behavior do they [24:38] approach [24:38] how do they react to your baby talk [24:41] after you've narrowed down [24:42] the the search then you can either visit [24:45] those dogs [24:46] out on the yard and look for how they [24:48] react [24:49] i'm okay with dogs jumping on me and not [24:50] having manners [24:52] i don't want any kind of crazy [24:54] mouthiness where they're [24:55] grabbing and they won't let go of [24:56] clothing i'm not looking for a dog that [24:59] wanders off and [25:00] never comes to visit me again it's [25:02] normal for the dogs to [25:04] go run around and explore their [25:05] environment if you're out into a larger [25:07] area [25:09] but i want some kind of social behavior [25:11] because that's going to be easiest to [25:12] train [25:13] is a dog that actually likes hanging out [25:14] with you so the biggest thing is social [25:17] behavior [25:17] just because they're shy aggressive in [25:19] the shelter doesn't mean they're going [25:20] to be bad dogs but stack the cards in [25:22] your favor [25:23] pick a dog that's friendly if you go to [25:25] a shelter or a rescue and none of the [25:27] dogs are showing [25:28] the happy-go-lucky wiggly body language [25:31] as you do that little test [25:32] that's fine there's plenty of shelters [25:34] and there's other rescues [25:35] that are going to be that may have dogs [25:38] that [25:39] that that will fit what your criteria is [25:41] and what you're looking for [25:42] not every shelter is going to have [25:44] social adoptable dogs [25:46] at one time and that's okay you have to [25:49] be willing to pass on these dogs [25:51] another thing that you can do too is go [25:53] up to the shelter and say i'm looking [25:55] for [25:55] a small dog that doesn't bark much [25:58] that's good with kids [25:59] what do you have available and a good [26:01] shelter will tell you oh [26:03] this one will be good this one will be [26:04] good this will be good then you can go [26:06] up and do that same little test and see [26:08] how they do [26:09] you can also ask if there's a guy at the [26:12] shelter hey can you come up and do that [26:13] test [26:14] i'm not very intimidating for a lot of [26:16] dogs so i [26:17] will get a lot of social friendly [26:19] response where if i get a guy with a [26:21] beard that's tall that's wearing hat [26:23] he may not get that same reaction so i [26:26] want to see with another person [26:28] does that dog still have that social [26:29] loose happy-go-lucky behavior [26:32] if i have that social happy-go-lucky [26:34] behavior i can save a lot of problems i [26:36] can save a lot of stress i can save a [26:38] lot of money on training [26:39] so if you're picking a dog from a [26:41] breeder or you're going to a rescue [26:44] making the right choice and picking a [26:45] dog that would be a good match for you [26:47] that is social friendly confident is [26:50] going to be the number one [26:51] that doesn't mean that you can't train [26:52] dogs that have issues [26:55] but if you're starting off on the right [26:56] foot everything else is going to be a [26:57] lot easier [26:58] because it's still likely that the dog [27:00] that you get may not be perfect [27:02] they may have issues and may be scared [27:04] of fireworks they may [27:07] pull on a leash they may be scared of [27:10] loud noises [27:11] whatever but at least if i know that i'm [27:13] starting with a dog that's social [27:15] happy confident then that'll make [27:17] everything else much easier later [27:19] so find a rescue that you can go and [27:22] actually interact with the dogs [27:23] some shelters you're not actually able [27:25] to do that i wouldn't recommend [27:27] adopting a dog just based on a picture [27:30] so don't do that some rescues will have [27:34] trial periods where you can take the dog [27:35] home for two weeks and see if it's a [27:37] good fit [27:38] i personally think that it takes a lot [27:39] longer than two weeks for a dog to get [27:41] settled in and find out if a dog is a [27:42] good fit or not [27:44] so for me that's not necessarily a [27:48] selling point but it's also a nice thing [27:50] so that way if it didn't [27:51] work out you know the dog can always go [27:53] back to the rescue [27:55] it's also good if you can find a rescue [27:58] or a shelter that does fosters because [28:01] the dog living in that home environment [28:02] will have a better idea of the dog's [28:04] temperament [28:05] they'll also know if the dog is reactive [28:07] to other dogs or barks at the door [28:09] all of those things that you may be [28:10] wanting to avoid [28:13] watch out for rescues that we do [28:17] that do what we call rescue retail [28:21] so if they're adopting golden retrievers [28:24] from china from the meat market that's [28:27] probably not true [28:28] they're also usually adopting these dogs [28:30] out for quite a bit of money [28:32] so make sure the source of where they're [28:34] getting their dogs [28:35] is reputable and the sources should be [28:38] from [28:39] you know either rescue them from the [28:41] streets bad situations owner relinquish [28:43] any of those resources or those sources [28:45] are fine [28:47] i don't like to support rescues that [28:49] import them from other countries [28:51] just because we have enough dogs here [28:52] that need homes that's really personal [28:54] preference [28:55] just watch out for red flags if they've [28:57] got purebred french bulldog puppies [28:59] that's probably rescue retail if they [29:02] have golden retrievers from the meat [29:04] market that's probably not true [29:06] so just make sure that you're doing your [29:07] research on them [29:09] most rescues or shelters are non-profits [29:13] all of that information is public so you [29:14] can always check that out [29:18] make sure that if you're getting a puppy [29:21] you can even have a trainer go with you [29:23] to look at the dog to make sure that the [29:24] puppy would be a good fit and kind of [29:26] have a better idea of temperament but [29:27] just make sure you're picking a dog [29:29] that isn't showing any red flags right [29:31] off the bat [29:32] i know that a lot of people want to pick [29:34] the dog that's shy that's hiding in the [29:36] corner because they feel bad for him [29:38] but when you're choosing a dog to have a [29:40] relationship for the next 15 years [29:42] or 14 years you're not going to you [29:45] shouldn't pick a dog that [29:47] you pity so you would never marry [29:49] somebody because you feel bad for them [29:51] right let's not do that with our dogs [29:53] either you want to pick a dog because [29:55] they are going to be good in your [29:57] relationship that you guys can live your [29:59] lives and be happy together [30:00] so don't pick a dog that you feel bad [30:02] for or he looks like you abuse [30:04] or you want to save them that will lead [30:07] to divorce [30:08] with your dog just like it leads to [30:09] divorce with people so make sure you [30:12] choose wisely when it comes to getting a [30:14] puppy or a dog and the same thing [30:16] happens when you get a puppy from a [30:17] breeder [30:18] don't pick a puppy from a bad breeder [30:20] because you want to save it from that [30:22] breeder [30:22] if you're paying them for that puppy you [30:24] are buying from them [30:25] even if you think that you are saving [30:27] that puppy from a bad situation [30:29] if you're exchanging money you are [30:30] buying a puppy [30:32] so and you are supporting that bad [30:34] breeder so never pick a puppy or [30:36] choose a dog because you feel bad for [30:38] them thank you again for watching today [30:41]

The moment your dog does a behavior you are trying to capture, you have to either deliver a primary-reinforcer or a conditioned-reinforcer within the first second. The same principle applies for actions you would not like your dog to repeat. The moment your dog does the behavior in question, you have to deliver either a primary correction or a conditioned correction within a second of your dog doing that behavior. Here is an example of how important timing is. Let's say you’re doing a down-stay with your dog and you’re in a wide-open space like a football field. While you're walking away from your dog across the field, your dog breaks the down-stay without you seeing. Your dog then decides to run to you, and when you turn around and see your dog running at you, you then correct your dog for breaking the down-stay. Even though you believe that you corrected your dog for breaking a down-stay, you just corrected your dog for coming to you. Since you did not see your dog break the down-stay, you should not have corrected the dog. Instead, you should have rewarded your dog for coming to you."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 125/841,"First, we want to develop our communication channels. We like to call these ""markers or conditioned reinforcers."" These are going to be words or sounds (such as a clicker) that will let our dog know when they are right or wrong. This is the very first step I do with any dog that I’m training, assuming the dog doesn’t have any fear or aggression issues. Some call this step loading the markers, while others call it engagement training. In this step you are paying (rewarding) your dog for focusing their attention on you. So, during this exercise, you are teaching your dog a few things: You are teaching them the communication channels, and you are teaching them that it's a good thing to look at you. The more engagement you get from your dog, the faster they will learn. ------------------------------------------------------------- STAY IN TOUCH! ------------------------------------------------------------- Nate Schoemer's Website: https://www.nateschoemer.com/ Instagram: http://instagram.com/NateSchoemer Facebook: http://facebook.com/NateSchoemer For additional support, I would suggest joining my Facebook community.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 126/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode today we are going to be doing [00:03] engagement training with a young [00:04] colleague puppy [00:05] i'm going to talk a little bit about [00:06] timing and why this step is so important [00:09] in the dog training process [00:11] it's been scientifically proven that we [00:12] have roughly one second give or take to [00:14] influence a dog's behavior [00:16] that means when your dog is doing [00:17] something that you're trying to capture [00:18] you have one second to let the dog know [00:20] if the behavior you would like them to [00:22] repeat [00:22] or if it's a behavior you would not like [00:24] them to repeat and if that reward or the [00:26] correction doesn't come within that [00:27] window the dog won't make the connection [00:29] so when we're teaching our dogs a [00:31] behavior [00:32] we have one second when they complete [00:34] the behavior to do one of two things [00:36] either a we can give the dog the primary [00:39] reinforcer which is food toy or [00:40] affection [00:41] or b we can let the dog know they're [00:43] going to receive [00:44] the primary reinforcer and this is by [00:46] implementing the condition reinforcer [00:48] also known as a marker also known as a [00:50] bridge [00:51] so what is this condition reinforcer [00:53] this marker it's a sound that predicts a [00:55] reward [00:56] you teach your dog that a certain sound [00:58] always means [00:59] a reward eventually the sound becomes [01:02] almost as powerful as the actual reward [01:05] you also have to keep in mind if you are [01:06] using your condition reinforcer so a [01:08] sound that predicts a reward [01:10] if you use that sound you always pay [01:12] your dog with the primary [01:13] look at it like a paycheck a paycheck is [01:16] valuable [01:16] because it always predicts a primary if [01:18] you're working for somebody and those [01:20] paychecks that they are paying you start [01:22] to bounce [01:23] you may stop working because you're no [01:24] longer getting that primary reinforcer [01:27] so don't let your paychecks bounce now [01:30] when we're conditioning our dog to the [01:31] marker we're going to be focusing on a [01:32] couple things number one you want to do [01:34] your best [01:35] to try to make sure that your marker [01:36] sound whatever word you decide to use [01:39] always sounds the same it's easy to [01:41] think about how clickers were so [01:42] successful number one the click always [01:44] sounds the same [01:45] so with your voice try to make sure your [01:47] yes or your good or whatever sound [01:49] you're using [01:50] sounds the same so yes yes yes [01:54] not yes yes [01:57] yes you don't want to change it you want [01:59] to make sure [02:00] it always sounds the same i like to use [02:02] two words for my [02:03] markers that predict rewards i have my [02:06] yes and i have my free [02:07] my yes is my continuation marker my free [02:10] is my terminal marker well what does [02:11] that mean because this often confuses [02:13] people as well [02:14] easiest way to think about what a word [02:16] means to a dog is what it predicts [02:17] the continuation marker equals reward [02:20] that's it [02:21] primary reward food toy affection so if [02:23] i say yes [02:24] my dog is going to get either food a toy [02:26] or affection [02:27] i like to reserve my markers though for [02:29] food and toys that tends to be more [02:31] valuable to most dogs because we pet [02:33] them all the time [02:34] so really food or toys and most of the [02:36] time in the beginning i'm using food [02:38] so yes means food or reward [02:41] free on the other hand the terminal [02:43] marker and again you can use whatever [02:44] word whatever sound you want to use for [02:46] these markers [02:48] that means release and reward so if i [02:51] say [02:51] free to a dog i'm telling the dog that's [02:53] the correct behavior you are released [02:55] from that behavior and you can receive a [02:56] reward [02:57] there's going to be times when you want [02:58] to use both markers [03:00] now we also have a release word a [03:02] release word is a sound [03:04] that releases the dog from the position [03:06] but it doesn't predict a reward and [03:08] because of this [03:08] it's just a release sound it's not a [03:11] release [03:12] marker so keep that in mind a marker is [03:14] only a marker when it predicts [03:16] a reward or predicts a correction so [03:18] marker could predict [03:20] you did a great job here's your reward [03:22] or don't do that again no you're gonna [03:23] receive a correction so it can go for [03:25] good or bad [03:26] the release word on the other hand just [03:28] means your release so again it's not a [03:30] marker [03:30] i use all done and i use break for my [03:33] release words [03:34] now when i'm working with the puppy i [03:35] want the puppy to look up at my face [03:37] in order to get the rewards this is why [03:39] it's called engagement training [03:40] the more engagement the more focus you [03:42] can get from your dog while training the [03:44] faster they're going to learn [03:45] so the puppy's going to look up at me [03:47] i'm going to say yes and then i'm going [03:49] to reward the puppy [03:50] once the puppy eats the food he looks at [03:52] me again i'm going to say [03:53] free then i'm going to move back [03:55] encouraging the puppy to jump up and get [03:56] the reward [03:57] during the training process when i say [03:59] yes i bring the reward to the dog and [04:01] when i say free [04:02] i move back encouraging the dog to come [04:04] and get the reward [04:05] that teaches them that free is release [04:07] and reward now once they're conditioned [04:08] to these sounds we no longer have to [04:10] move back this is another common [04:12] question that i've had in some of my [04:13] videos [04:14] if your dog is conditioned to the word [04:15] free and let's say you tell your dog to [04:16] down [04:17] once you lure your dog into the down [04:19] position you say free [04:20] you can hand the food directly to your [04:22] dog while they're still in the down you [04:24] don't have to make them jump up to get [04:25] the reward as long as they're [04:26] conditioned at that point [04:28] and they understand that it means [04:29] release and reward so you can hand them [04:30] the food and they can jump up [04:32] so now what applications or what value [04:35] is there to having these two markers [04:37] well [04:37] the continuation marker is often called [04:39] the continuation marker because if [04:40] you're working on a stay [04:42] sit stay down stay climb stay whatever [04:44] it is you use the continuation marker [04:46] because you're telling your dog that's [04:47] correct [04:48] i'm going to give you a reward but i'm [04:50] not releasing you it just means you're [04:51] getting a reward [04:52] so you're able to reward the dog [04:54] multiple times for doing a long stay [04:56] when you're first teaching them [04:58] that stay command the terminal marker is [05:00] very valuable for a few reasons as well [05:02] number one if you're not ready to [05:04] reinforce the stay [05:05] then you use the terminal marker so if [05:07] i'm starting to teach a dog the verbal [05:09] command [05:09] and i say down and that dog lays down [05:11] and i don't want to reinforce a down [05:12] stay [05:13] then i'm going to use my terminal marker [05:14] free i'm letting the dog know that's [05:16] correct [05:17] you don't have to stay there you can [05:18] jump up and get the reward so it helps [05:20] when we're not [05:20] wanting or not ready to reinforce the [05:22] stay another reason [05:24] that makes the terminal marker so [05:26] valuable and why i use it so much in the [05:28] beginning [05:28] is because it also teaches the dog the [05:30] faster they get into the position that [05:32] i'm asking them to perform [05:33] the faster they get to jump up and get [05:35] the reward and they tend to do it more [05:37] quickly [05:38] speed for our dogs is based on [05:40] motivation and this really helps [05:42] increase our dog's speed now when [05:44] teaching these markers we have to make [05:46] sure that there is a pause [05:47] in between the sound and the delivery of [05:49] the reward [05:50] so the very first thing i'm going to do [05:52] is i'm going to take the food i'm going [05:53] to show the puppy that i have the food [05:54] and i'm going to hold it by my face [05:56] once the puppy looks up in my face i'm [05:58] going to say yes [06:00] then i'm going to deliver a reward in [06:02] the beginning we hold our hands [06:03] by our face we know that the dog is [06:05] looking at our hands because the dog [06:07] knows that the food [06:09] comes from our hands so we get them used [06:11] to looking up at our face by holding our [06:13] hands [06:13] by our face after we say the sound you [06:16] have [06:16] one second before you have to start [06:19] moving to deliver the reward [06:21] meaning i say yes once i'm done saying [06:23] yes i have one second before i have to [06:25] start to move [06:26] to deliver the reward to the dog or the [06:28] puppy so i go yes [06:30] and then i can start moving as long as [06:32] that movement starts [06:33] before the one second this is only [06:35] during the process when we're [06:37] conditioning them [06:38] to the markers same with the three i say [06:39] three and then i have to start moving [06:41] back [06:42] within a second after i say free to get [06:44] the dog conditioned [06:46] if you wait too long then the dog's not [06:48] going to become conditioned [06:49] or if you say it and you move at the [06:51] exact same time [06:52] they're not going to become conditioned [06:54] so if you go yes they won't become [06:56] conditioned or if you go yes [06:58] and you wait too long and your reward [07:00] they're not going to become conditioned [07:02] so [07:02] it's that window yes and then reward [07:05] what helps a lot of people is to [07:06] actually say the marker twice and then [07:08] deliver the reward but say it in your [07:10] head so go [07:10] yes yes reward but don't say it out loud [07:13] go [07:14] yes reward so in my head i'm going yes [07:17] yes reward that's usually the perfect [07:19] amount of timing [07:20] in order to get the dog conditioned to [07:22] the reward or the marker [07:24] once they're conditioned to the marker [07:26] this is another question that i ask a [07:27] lot of people how long do you have [07:29] to deliver the primary reinforcer to [07:31] your dog [07:32] after you said the marker so when you [07:33] say yes how long do you have to get that [07:36] reward to your dog before you lose the [07:37] connection [07:38] most people say one second that's not [07:40] the case if the dog is conditioned to [07:42] the marker [07:43] you have as long as they are paying [07:44] attention so if you have your dog 30 [07:46] feet away from you and you tell your dog [07:47] sit and your dog sits and you say yes [07:49] and your dog's conditioned to yes [07:50] and he knows he's going to receive a [07:52] reward once you say yes your dog goes [07:54] i did it correctly you start walking [07:56] towards your dog the dog's going oh here [07:58] comes the treat here comes the reward [08:00] he sees you reach your hand into the [08:02] treat bag or whatever it is that you [08:03] have [08:04] he sees you pull out the treat he goes [08:05] there's my treat i'm getting paid and [08:07] you hand him the reward [08:08] you made the connection even though that [08:10] reward came way after the behavior you [08:12] were capturing [08:13] your dog knows whatever he or she was [08:15] doing when [08:16] they heard that sound is what they're [08:18] being rewarded for you're gonna see how [08:20] these markers are gonna come into play [08:21] throughout the entire training process [08:23] another common question that's often [08:25] asked is do i always have to give my dog [08:28] a ton of rewards when training do i [08:30] always need treats [08:31] is this something if i start training my [08:33] dog with treats am i always going to [08:34] have to need treats when training [08:36] no we start with treats in the beginning [08:38] we start with continual reinforcement [08:40] meaning we reward every single behavior [08:42] but once the dog starts to do the [08:43] command on the verbal alone so i say [08:45] down the dog lays down without that help [08:47] of the physical cue [08:48] then i start to space out the rewards i [08:50] have a video explaining exactly how to [08:52] do that [08:53] but remember dogs always need to know [08:56] the with [08:56] them what's in it for me contrary to [08:58] popular belief dogs don't do things just [09:01] to make us happy [09:02] they do things either to access [09:03] something pleasant prevent something [09:05] unpleasant or the behavior it's fun [09:07] now if you teach your dog that training [09:08] with you is a lot of fun and they love [09:10] that then they will start to train with [09:12] you just because the act of training [09:13] with you is fun [09:14] but in the beginning most are going to [09:16] need a little bit of encouragement [09:17] whether that's with food [09:18] or it's going to be with toys i like to [09:20] start with food because we [09:22] can use luring we can use shaping in [09:24] order to teach a bunch of different [09:25] behaviors to our dog [09:26] so let's not waste any more time let's [09:28] jump right into this training session [09:29] i'm going to show you exactly how you're [09:31] going to get your puppy or your dog [09:32] conditioned to these markers [09:34] all right so we're going to be doing [09:35] engagement training with spock here [09:37] spock is a young kali puppy now remember [09:40] what i talked about the sound has to [09:41] come before the delivery of the reward [09:44] so i get his attention i bring my hands [09:46] to my face yes [09:48] then i reward notice there was a slight [09:50] pause [09:52] between saying the marker yes and [09:54] delivering the reward [09:55] it has to be yes reward [09:59] not the common mistake that most people [10:00] do [10:02] yes you see how i moved at the exact [10:04] same time as i delivered the reward [10:07] if he's going to take it seems like he's [10:08] chewing the other piece still [10:11] so again we have to make sure that we [10:12] say the sound before we deliver the [10:14] reward that's the only way the dog's [10:15] going to become conditioned [10:17] so now i'm going to show you a quick [10:18] engagement training session that i like [10:20] to do with a dog [10:21] so you can see what it looks like [10:22] without me constantly having to [10:23] communicate back to the camera [10:25] all right so here we go yes [10:28] good job buddy very nice [10:32] free come on good boy very good oops [10:36] we dropped the piece that's okay he [10:38] doesn't know [10:41] yes reward good boy very nice [10:45] free movement pay attention to the pause [10:49] pay attention to how i'm saying the [10:51] marker it always sounds the same [10:54] yes and i'm not worried about him doing [10:56] any sort of commanded behavior i just [10:58] want him looking up at me [11:00] free and then we move back this is the [11:03] first step now most dogs don't need much [11:05] beyond this when it comes to engagement [11:07] training [11:08] yes but if you want to go above and [11:10] beyond or if you plan on doing a focus [11:12] heal or competition style obedience [11:15] then you want to get the dog or the [11:16] puppy to understand it's looking at your [11:18] face [11:19] yes and not just looking at your hands [11:22] that's getting the reward so the way [11:23] that i do that is i start exact same way [11:26] i would [11:26] i bring the food up by my face and then [11:28] i move one hand out [11:29] he follows the hand when he looks back [11:31] at me [11:33] yes then i mark and reward and then i do [11:36] the same thing with the other hand [11:38] i bring that hand out i wait till he [11:39] looks at me yes [11:41] when he looks at me i mark and reward [11:43] then i do both hands [11:44] [Music] [11:46] yes and then reward so that's showing [11:48] him it's looking at my face [11:50] that's getting the reward and not just [11:52] my hand all right so we're gonna do a [11:54] couple more [11:56] free and then we move also notice how i [11:59] change [11:59] hands yes [12:03] reward good very nice buddy [12:06] free reward excellent [12:11] good yes [12:16] notice the pause again free [12:19] very good now i like to continue this [12:22] until the dog becomes conditioned to the [12:23] marker [12:24] how do we know in a dog's condition to [12:26] the marker well the same way [12:28] ivan pavlov knew his dogs were [12:29] conditioned to the markers that whole [12:31] classical conditioning [12:32] when the sound went off before the food [12:34] was delivered to the dogs they would [12:35] begin to salivate [12:37] before the food was present and again [12:38] that's what he called classical [12:40] conditioning [12:40] the four most common change of behaviors [12:42] i see in a dog that's conditioned to the [12:44] marker [12:45] is opening their mouth salivating [12:47] licking their lips [12:48] or moving their paws so if i think a dog [12:51] is conditioned i'll get them in front of [12:52] me [12:53] let them scratch do what they got to do [12:55] and then once they look at me i say the [12:57] marker [12:58] yes but i wouldn't deliver the reward [13:00] right away [13:01] i would watch to see if there's a change [13:03] of behavior yes [13:05] if i see a change of behavior i know the [13:07] dog's condition to the markers [13:09] now usually i'll do this for a day maybe [13:11] two most dogs will become conditioned [13:13] pretty fast to these sounds [13:15] but before every training session i like [13:18] to spend 15 to 30 seconds [13:20] on engagement training because it gets [13:22] our dogs engaged and the more engaged [13:24] your dog is [13:24] the faster your dog is going to learn [13:26] what's expected of them [13:28] so now i'm going to show you a quick [13:29] little exercise that i'm going to be [13:30] doing [13:31] this would be my second step in the [13:33] training but i want you guys to see what [13:35] a training exercise might look like [13:37] with a brand new young pup so he's over [13:40] here trying to get into the bag of food [13:41] come here big guy come in yay good boy [13:45] and so with him he's following my hand [13:48] already really nicely so i can start [13:51] luring him [13:52] into different positions when i'm luring [13:54] a dog into positions [13:56] i'm not saying the position that i want [13:59] the dog to perform [14:00] i'm simply showing the dog a physical [14:02] cue and in this case we're using the [14:04] food [14:05] to get them to do the behavior the [14:07] moment they do the behavior [14:09] i can mark and reward here's another [14:12] thing to keep in mind when we're doing [14:13] luring [14:14] we have to let oh is this a little high [14:16] for you is it a little high [14:18] come on you could do it oh oh oh he [14:21] climbed up and didn't realize how high [14:22] he was [14:23] let's help him out here we go oh there [14:24] you go you did it little super dog [14:27] nice work when we're using luring so if [14:30] i lift up watch his butt hits the ground [14:32] i can give him that food within a second [14:34] of him completing the behavior [14:36] same thing with the down any command [14:38] that i'm trying to get him to perform [14:40] come on buddy by using luring we can [14:44] just give him the reward once he's in [14:45] the position [14:46] and we make the connection however it is [14:49] good to practice [14:50] always using those markers so it would [14:52] look like this [14:53] yes reward and since he's not in a [14:56] commanded position [14:58] yes during this step i could use yes or [15:01] i could use free [15:03] free good job if i want him to come to [15:05] me come on buddy buddy buddy [15:07] very nice yes oh [15:12] you go yes [15:15] very nice get him to come into heel [15:18] position [15:19] but this is how i would do an early [15:21] session with this guy because [15:22] right now he's not ready for commands [15:24] but he's good with the markers [15:26] and he's good at following food so i can [15:29] start showing him [15:31] all these cool little things i can get [15:33] him to do with luring [15:34] now what i recommend before putting any [15:36] sort of command [15:37] on a command like before you say down [15:40] make sure you can get your dog to do the [15:41] command [15:42] with that physical cue the way that you [15:45] like [15:46] every single time and once you have that [15:48] perfect picture [15:49] then you can move to naming a commander [15:52] putting [15:52] the behavior on a command so for this [15:54] next week all i'm mostly going to be [15:56] doing with this little guy [15:57] is engagement training and teaching him [16:00] how to get from one position to the next [16:02] using that concept of luring i'm also [16:05] going to show him a few other things but [16:06] it's all basically going to be luring so [16:08] if you're starting [16:09] and you're working with your puppy right [16:10] now or a brand new dog start doing this [16:12] take your time don't rush it [16:14] get it to where it feels like a dance [16:16] where you start to do something boom [16:18] your dog already knows [16:19] what you want him to do because you guys [16:21] are so in sync with each other [16:22] with the training and it makes [16:23] everything go so much more smoothly [16:25] alright i hope you guys enjoyed today's [16:27] video

If I'm using food, I will lift my hand up, and as the dog follows my hand, their butt naturally goes down into a sit. The moment the dog sits, I would use one of my markers and then I would reward the dog. Once I know that every time I lift my hand up the dog will sit, it is then time to name the command. This goes for any command we’re trying to teach our dogs. Simplified: we must first get the dog to perform the behavior with a physical cue. Once we have our dog performing the action with our physical cue it is then time to name the command. Now keep in mind, it doesn’t matter what the physical cue is, as long as you know you can get your dog to do the behavior every time with that cue. Here are a few examples: • You want to get your dog to smile on command and you realize that blowing in your dog’s face gets this behavior. Blowing in your dog’s face would be the physical cue. • Teasing your dog with a toy or knocking on the wall could get your dog to bark. This would be the physical cue you could use to teach your dog to bark on command. • Placing a treat under a call bell could get your dog to ring the bell in an attempt to access the food."

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 130/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode we are back again today with [00:03] little adorable spock [00:05] and what we're going to be doing is [00:06] we're going to be showing him oh i'm [00:08] throwing him on the mic [00:09] we're going to be showing him the [00:10] physical cue to get him to perform 10 [00:13] different behaviors [00:14] now i'm not going to go into too much [00:15] detail onto every single one [00:17] i do have a video for each behavior that [00:20] we're going to be teaching him that you [00:22] could check out for more detailed [00:23] information [00:24] but i'm going to show you how we're [00:25] going to be doing it with spock by using [00:27] a technique known as luring so we're [00:30] going to start with the sit keep in mind [00:31] wherever your dog's nose goes the butt [00:33] does the opposite [00:34] we want him to be able to do all the [00:36] behaviors on the luring [00:37] alone but some of them we may need to [00:39] help with other techniques [00:41] if that is the case make sure whatever [00:43] you're using to help your pup [00:44] understand the concept of luring that [00:46] comes after you start the luring [00:49] because it has to become a predictable [00:50] pattern so let's get spock over here [00:52] spock [00:53] come here buddy come on come on over [00:55] here over here [00:57] over here he's chewing on something let [00:59] me get him [01:00] so we're going to do the sit first [01:02] wherever nose goes butt does the [01:04] opposite so we take our hand [01:05] we lift up yes once our pups [01:08] rear end hits the ground that's when we [01:11] mark [01:12] so he's chewing his food come and be gay [01:15] lift [01:16] yes and reward during this step since [01:18] we're not [01:19] saying the command notice i'm not [01:21] telling him to sit we could also use our [01:23] terminal marker so we can lift [01:24] free and reward lift [01:28] free and reward [01:31] so again remember for him free means [01:33] he's going to get a reward and he's [01:35] released [01:36] yes means he's going to get a reward [01:38] again during this step [01:39] we can use either marker it's completely [01:41] up to you [01:43] so lift yes reward now for the down [01:47] a common mistake people make with the [01:48] down is they'll bring their hand down [01:50] and as the dog tries to go for it [01:52] they'll move their hand away what you [01:54] want to do is you want to go straight [01:56] down [01:56] and you also want to create a cave with [01:58] your hand what i mean by that [02:00] when i'm going down i'm doing this you [02:02] can kind of see it creates a cave that [02:04] our dog has to place their muzzle into [02:07] and when they go [02:08] down and they place their muzzle into [02:09] that cave it naturally brings the rear [02:11] end down [02:12] so again we cup the food and we go [02:14] straight down [02:15] yes once the elbows hit the ground we [02:18] mark [02:18] and reward we can use this as an [02:20] opportunity as well to bring [02:22] him back up into the sit so again we go [02:24] down yes [02:25] then we reward we bring him back up [02:29] once he finishes chewing yes into the [02:31] sit [02:32] so i can do some puppy push-ups right [02:34] here yes [02:35] make them do it down and then bring him [02:37] back up to the sit yes [02:39] very simple the next one is going to be [02:41] the stand with the stand i like to take [02:43] my hand and i like to turn the cup [02:46] or the bowl like if i create a bowl i [02:48] turn the bowl away [02:50] so then the puppy or the dog has to come [02:52] around to get their muzzle inside which [02:54] will naturally bring their back end up [02:56] it doesn't always work right away and he [02:57] struggles a little bit with it [02:59] so i'm gonna help him out just by taking [03:01] my hand underneath his belly scooping up [03:03] his back end [03:04] so i take the food bring it underneath [03:07] and then i help him out [03:08] yes once he pops up that back end i mark [03:11] and reward [03:12] so again we lift yes [03:15] so i could do a sit there and then i [03:17] bring this to his chest then [03:19] i help yes and reward again if you're [03:22] gonna help out like i am right here [03:24] make sure whatever you're using for the [03:26] lure [03:27] comes first so if i have him in front of [03:29] me i'm doing the lure first which he [03:32] doesn't fully know yet then i'm helping [03:33] yes so again it becomes a predictable [03:36] pattern he likes to pop his rear end up [03:37] and shift a little bit to the side [03:39] if that continues then i could use [03:42] something like [03:43] a shaping box or i could use a wall to [03:45] prevent him from practicing that [03:47] but for the demonstration purposes it's [03:50] okay [03:50] again tucked to his chest help him out [03:52] yes reward [03:54] so that's going to be the start of our [03:56] stand command [03:57] next one's going to be heal if you're [03:59] working on precision style obedience and [04:01] you're going to do a competition heal [04:03] you're going to do a lot more than what [04:04] i'm showing right now all we want for [04:06] this is to show him how to find the heel [04:08] position [04:09] the heel position is just going to be on [04:11] the left side of my body [04:13] so what i want to do for that is i'm [04:14] going to step back with my left leg i'm [04:16] going to use my left hand [04:18] to guide him into heel position once [04:20] he's in the position mark and reward [04:22] so i step back there he goes swing him [04:24] back [04:25] and then mark and reward [04:29] this is an excellent exercise to do if [04:32] you want to do loose leash walking [04:34] i like to get the dog or puppy i'm [04:35] working with come on buddy [04:37] used to going around in the heel [04:39] position getting the reward [04:41] and then i jump back and i get him to go [04:43] back in the heel position [04:45] excellent very nice i'll go back again [04:48] notice how his head goes out this way [04:51] and around and [04:52] in that's the way i like to get them to [04:54] find the heel position the reason for [04:56] that [04:57] if you take your dog come on buddy and [05:00] you have him go like this [05:03] into heel position then you're not going [05:05] to get that pretty [05:06] flip finish that you want if you're [05:09] doing [05:09] any sort of advanced obedience but even [05:11] with a pet dog [05:12] having a flip finish is very nice so [05:15] that's when they're in the sit front [05:17] position directly in front of you [05:19] and you guide them around come on come [05:21] on you can do it [05:22] there we go and he's got it and they [05:25] come back [05:26] into that heel position but when they [05:27] fully understand it [05:29] then they'll just swing their butt [05:30] around to each spot [05:32] so i'm kind of helping him out but you [05:34] get the idea that's going to be the heel [05:37] the next one is the come when called so [05:39] with [05:40] all i do is a little bow i drop my body [05:42] and i do a little bow [05:44] that little bow brings the dog or the [05:47] puppy directly in front of me [05:49] once they get close i lift up which gets [05:51] them to sit [05:52] this is also known as a backwards follow [05:54] exercise what's good about this is i [05:56] could walk backwards [05:57] and just hand them treats the whole time [06:00] so i'm gonna swing back around this way [06:02] and then anytime i want to stop all i [06:04] have to do is lift my hand up [06:07] and this is one of the first steps to [06:10] teaching [06:11] a come when called again we want to mark [06:14] when our puppy is doing it correctly [06:16] as i'm walking backwards i could mark [06:19] when he's coming towards me there's [06:21] different times when we can mark so i [06:22] could [06:22] do this and go yes and give him a treat [06:26] i could stop and lift yes give him a [06:29] reward [06:30] i could even walk backwards he's eating [06:33] the food [06:34] come on [06:38] and just reward him because he's getting [06:40] the primary the exact moment he's doing [06:42] it right [06:44] this also comes in mind with [06:47] reward placement notice how i'm giving [06:49] him the rewards very close to my body [06:51] because i want him to be close to me if [06:53] you're getting a habit of your dog [06:54] sitting in front of you and you're [06:55] reaching out to give him the reward [06:57] then that's going to be the position [06:59] that your dog or your puppy is looking [07:00] for in order to get those rewards [07:02] so we always want to reward them come [07:04] here you [07:06] come on i know those other dogs can be [07:08] distracting we want to reward them [07:11] when they're in the position that's not [07:14] a good position we'll try again [07:17] he's a little distracted from the [07:18] neighbors dogs barking [07:20] so that's going to be our come when [07:21] called so we've done sit [07:23] down stand come heel [07:26] now we're going to do the climb command [07:27] again climb is anything elevated when [07:30] we're teaching the climb command it's a [07:31] great opportunity to also teach the off [07:33] command [07:34] so what we're going to do is take the [07:35] food guide them up on top [07:38] yes then reward take the food guide them [07:41] off [07:42] showing them that we got it come on [07:43] buddy oh [07:45] there you go yes [07:48] and we're gonna guide him back up nice [07:50] job buddy [07:52] good boy this is a good confidence [07:54] exercise for him [07:55] and back off one more time come on come [07:57] on oh [07:58] you can do it you can do it yay and [08:01] that's going to be the climb and the off [08:03] command [08:04] next one is the spin all we're going to [08:06] do is we're going to take the food and [08:08] get our dog to spin in a circle [08:10] you can go either way i like to only [08:13] teach dogs to go [08:14] counterclockwise and the reason for that [08:16] is when i have them in heel position [08:19] oh you can do it i gotta remember not to [08:23] give them so many pieces because it [08:24] takes them a second to chew [08:26] all right so when he's in heel position [08:28] i like to have them spin [08:30] as a way to kind of break up heal a [08:32] little bit and make it more fun for my [08:34] dog [08:34] so again i always get them to spin [08:36] counterclockwise [08:37] now you may find with a dog that doesn't [08:39] have as much perseverance [08:41] they may give up halfway through [08:44] if that's the case just start small [08:46] reward right there [08:48] and then as he gets better reward a [08:49] little farther and as he gets better you [08:52] reward him the entire way so depending [08:54] on your dog's perseverance and [08:55] motivation is going to [08:57] really dictate how difficult or how easy [08:59] the spin is [09:00] so now we did the spin again another [09:02] very simple command [09:04] next one is going to be walking [09:05] backwards so i've never had him walk [09:08] backwards yet so this is going to be a [09:09] first [09:10] when i have my hands open that means [09:12] come to me when i close my hands that [09:14] means walk away or not walk away i'm [09:16] sorry walk backwards [09:18] so i'll show you how i do this i bring [09:19] the food to me or the puppy [09:21] and then i close and i walk towards him [09:22] yes once he takes one step backwards i [09:25] mark and reward i don't have to get him [09:26] to take 20 steps back [09:28] just one in the beginning so we close [09:30] our fist we walk towards him oh he fell [09:32] if i need to help him again yes [09:35] good so that took a little extra help i [09:38] had to use my left hand as well [09:40] yes good so he's walking backwards now [09:43] yes very nice [09:47] very good buddy go ahead get that piece [09:49] yes [09:50] good so you see i'm just marking one [09:53] maybe two steps at a time [09:55] when he gets better at it we can get him [09:57] to walk back [09:58] way farther with less rewards so let's [10:01] try again [10:02] close the fist walk towards him yes very [10:04] good buddy [10:06] yes excellent nicely done i could also [10:09] say [10:10] free good boy [10:13] free very nice all right another very [10:17] simple [10:18] one when done correctly now we're going [10:20] to do the center command [10:21] center command is very fun dogs usually [10:24] love it [10:24] keep that in mind if you're going to [10:26] teach your dog the center command they [10:27] do usually like it and they will [10:29] offer it up sometimes when you may not [10:32] be expecting it [10:33] so if you have a larger dog breed keep [10:35] that in mind you might be hanging out [10:36] talking to your friends and then your [10:37] dog comes and says hello right between [10:39] your legs [10:40] so the way that i do that is i keep food [10:42] in both hands [10:43] the food that's in my right hand i do [10:45] not give to the dog right away [10:47] i give them the food that's in the left [10:48] hand when they get into the position so [10:50] i'm just using this hand to guide him [10:52] you'll see what i mean [10:53] so i guide him around he's not getting [10:54] that food then i switch them to my other [10:56] hand [10:57] now he gets the food and now i can walk [11:00] and give them food from both hands [11:02] i can also have them sit by lifting up [11:05] so now you can see [11:06] all these different skills that we've [11:08] been able to to develop [11:10] with spock here by using luring can [11:12] create a very fun [11:14] very engaging training session the very [11:16] last one we're going to do is the place [11:18] bowl [11:19] so i'm going to grab that real quick you [11:20] can keep filming a little spock running [11:22] around [11:24] alright so now we have the place bowl [11:27] the goal with this he hasn't done this [11:28] yet either [11:29] all i want him to do is place his paws [11:31] on the bowl [11:32] once he places his paws on the bowl i'll [11:34] mark and reward so yes [11:36] he's so easy all right let's get another [11:38] one yes [11:39] very nice very good now i can make it [11:43] fun where i can go free [11:44] and release him let him come and get it [11:46] excellent and then let's go back [11:49] free oh good boy at first we don't need [11:52] both paws [11:52] one is fine get him to do the other one [11:57] free oh good boy nice job buddy [12:01] we'll do one more he's so easy now [12:03] there's more that i like to do [12:05] with this this helps teach our dog a [12:08] little bit of that rear end awareness [12:10] a lot of trainers also use this to help [12:12] teach the flip finish [12:13] i also like to use this when i'm [12:15] teaching my healing sticks [12:17] but this is a good starting platform [12:19] just to get your puppy [12:20] to place his paws on the front of the [12:22] bowl we can have him jump [12:24] off come on big guy go back [12:27] and put his paws on the ball you could [12:29] do it there you go nice job [12:31] and then i like to just get them to [12:32] pivot their back end just like he's [12:34] doing now and again this is the very [12:36] first time spock has done the bowl here [12:38] so again let's get him to go the other [12:40] way and i'm looking for that leg to turn [12:42] yes [12:42] or to step to the side rather get him to [12:45] go the other way [12:47] just by holding the food yes and you see [12:50] he has to [12:50] change his position if he wants to get [12:53] to the food [12:55] in an easier way than trying to really [12:57] work for it [12:58] so you see how i cup it in my hand by [12:59] turning [13:01] he has to turn his head which will [13:03] naturally [13:04] get that back in to pivot hey i'm up [13:07] here [13:08] let's do one more get it a pivot yes [13:10] there we go [13:12] so you can see very simple very [13:15] fun training and during this step [13:17] remember you're not worried about saying [13:19] the command [13:21] present the physical cue that can get [13:23] your dog or your puppy [13:24] to do the behavior every single time [13:27] without fail [13:28] once you have it at that point then you [13:30] can move on to the next step [13:32] which is placing the behavior on a [13:33] command and a command can be physical [13:36] or verbal as long as it precedes the [13:39] physical cue [13:40] because then it becomes a predictable [13:42] pattern and our dog's able to learn [13:44] so if you're training a new puppy or if [13:46] you're following along you have an older [13:47] dog [13:48] start with this get your dog get your [13:49] puppy to do all the behaviors that you [13:51] like [13:52] by using that technique of luring you're [13:55] going to start with continual [13:56] reinforcement [13:57] you're rewarding every single behavior [13:59] but once your dog starts to do the [14:00] behaviors on the command alone [14:02] that'll give you an opportunity to start [14:04] spacing out your rewards [14:05] so you don't have to give a treat for [14:07] every little behavior [14:09] but we like to start that way so i hope [14:11] you guys enjoyed today's episode let me [14:12] know you think about the comments below [14:14] and take your time with it be patient [14:16] have fun remember dog training is [14:18] supposed to be [14:19] fun all right thanks again guys and i'll [14:21] see you in the next one also [14:23] leave a comment

If you pair (overshadow) your physical cue with your command as stated earlier, the physical will override the command and become the only cue for the behavior. An example of this could be as simple as saying “Good boy” (or the marker that trainers would prefer, “yes”) simultaneously to feeding the dog the reward. By mixing these two actions together, the verbal marker will not have any relevance in the dog’s mind. If we want the dog to learn the command, then it is important to make sure that the command (verbal or physical) precedes the physical cue by a split second. It must be predictable to the dog. So, the process becomes: command, motivate, mark, and reward, in that order. • First say sit (command). • Then you lift your hand with the treat (motivate). • Once the dog's butt hits the ground, you either give the reward within the first second or you mark and then reward. • You will continue to use the physical cues until the dog beats you to it."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 133/841,"Meaning, if you say sit and before you lift your hand—the dog is already sitting. This process is the same even if you want to teach a service dog to perform a specific command based on an involuntary human behavior conducted by the person with the disability. For example, you’re training a service dog to nudge his handler when his handler reaches high levels of stress, such as with a veteran suffering from PTSD. First you would need to figure out what the veteran’s involuntary behavior is. For this example, we will say that the veteran looks up and starts to breathe heavily. Once we know this, then that will become the command for the behavior. The next step would be to present a physical cue that can get the dog to nudge your leg (which will be transitioned to the veteran later), let’s say tapping your own leg works for this dog. Now the process would go as follows: • First look up and breathe heavily (the command). • Then you would tap on your leg to get the dog to nudge your leg (motivate). • Once the dog nudges you, you either give the reward within the first second or you mark and then reward. • You will continue to use the physical cues until the dog beats you to it. Meaning, you look up and breathe heavily and before you tap your leg—the dog is already nudging you. ---------------------------------------------------------- STAY IN TOUCH! ------------------------------------------------------------- Nate Schoemer's Website: https://www.nateschoemer.com/ Instagram: http://instagram.com/NateSchoemer For additional support, I would suggest joining my Facebook community.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 135/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another episode today we [00:02] are going to start introducing the [00:03] verbal command to our dogs now [00:05] if you've been following my channel [00:06] you've seen this in a few of the other [00:08] ones and it's something i talk about a [00:09] lot [00:10] and it's known as pairing or also known [00:12] as overshadowing [00:14] this is the most common mistake that [00:15] most people make when they start to give [00:17] their dog the verbal command [00:19] so what they do is they say the verbal [00:21] command at the exact same time they're [00:23] given the physical cue [00:24] for example they go sit or down [00:27] you may have done that yourself now it's [00:29] been scientifically proven that if you [00:31] pair your physical with your verbal [00:33] the physical will override the verbal [00:35] again it's known as overshadowing [00:37] so if two things are presented to a dog [00:40] at one time [00:41] whichever of those two is more relevant [00:43] to the dog [00:44] is going to be what they focus on and [00:46] they're going to completely ignore the [00:48] other one [00:48] and our dogs notice physical movements [00:51] way more or much easier than our verbals [00:54] so if you want your dog to know the [00:56] verbal command this is very important [00:58] the verbal command must come before the [01:00] physical cue [01:01] so instead of saying sit as we lift or [01:04] down as we point or heal [01:07] doesn't matter we have to say that [01:09] verbal [01:10] before the physical it has to be a [01:12] predictable pattern [01:13] this is the same with our markers [01:14] remember our markers we say yes [01:16] then we reward we say free or whatever [01:18] word you choose [01:19] then we give that cue so with our [01:21] commands we say sit [01:23] then we lift our hands down then we [01:26] present the cue [01:27] if you are pairing it together your [01:29] dog's not going to learn [01:31] now i have come across people where they [01:33] taught their dog the verbal command [01:34] even though they were pairing you might [01:36] wonder well how are they able to do that [01:37] if science has proven [01:39] that you have to say the verbal before [01:40] the physical cue it's simple [01:42] they think their dog already knows it on [01:44] the verbal command so they look at their [01:46] dog and they go sit [01:47] the dog doesn't sit and then they go sit [01:51] then the dog sits so the dog was [01:53] learning the verbal command because it [01:55] actually preceded the physical cue [01:57] even though they didn't know they were [01:58] doing it that way so you want to be [02:00] aware of this [02:01] it should be broken down into four parts [02:03] command motivate mark [02:04] reward on a timeline command comes first [02:08] then the physical cue comes next then [02:10] the marker [02:11] or you can give your dog the primary [02:12] within a second i've talked about this [02:14] as well [02:15] and then if you've used the marker then [02:16] you follow it up with the primary [02:18] so we're going to be demonstrating with [02:20] little spock here he just got back from [02:22] the vet clinic and he doesn't like car [02:23] rides so he drooled a little bit [02:25] but he's feeling better now so we're [02:28] going to start doing the commands and [02:29] i'm going to have you focus on one thing [02:31] at a time [02:31] and then i'm going to let you know what [02:32] to focus on after we do each part so [02:35] it's going to be broken down in a way [02:37] that should be pretty easy to follow [02:39] so what i want you to pay attention is [02:41] notice how i say the command [02:43] then i do the cue i just want you to pay [02:45] attention to that and i'm going to go [02:46] through a few commands [02:48] with spock here now the physical cue [02:50] that i'm going to be using is either [02:52] going to be luring [02:53] or i might be using the leash pressure [02:54] cue as well i like to go back and forth [02:56] between the two [02:57] and we're going to do multiple different [02:59] commands to make it as interesting as [03:01] possible so [03:02] we're going to get started right now [03:03] good boy so we give him a treat get him [03:05] started [03:06] now notice i'm walking backwards he's [03:08] trying to get the food [03:09] i say sit then i lift free then i move [03:13] sit then i lift and i drop the piece [03:17] free then i move good boy even from [03:20] right here i can give him the climb [03:22] command so i go [03:23] climb then the q now what helps a lot of [03:27] people [03:27] is to say what you're doing when you do [03:31] it so what i mean by that is [03:33] say the command and then say what you're [03:35] doing so we can use the word [03:36] now for example so i can go [03:39] down now free [03:42] reward come [03:46] now free [03:49] reward spin [03:53] now free reward [03:57] climb now [04:00] free reward off [04:04] now free reward [04:08] now pay attention to when i'm saying the [04:10] marker i say the marker the moment he [04:12] completes the behavior i'm trying to [04:14] pinpoint the completion of the behavior [04:16] down now free reward [04:20] off now free reward [04:24] i can use the leash pressure as well now [04:26] remember when we're using [04:28] the leash it's not really [04:31] pressure it's more like a leash cue [04:34] we're using the leash to help guide our [04:36] dog into the position [04:37] so for example if i'm using my foot i'm [04:40] not stepping on the leash and forcing [04:42] him into the down position [04:43] i'm using it as a queue so sit [04:47] now free reward also right there i set [04:51] free and [04:52] that's the terminal marker he's [04:53] conditioned to it so he knows [04:55] knows that free means release and reward [04:58] when we're first teaching the terminal [05:00] marker free [05:01] we move back encouraging the dog to come [05:03] get it so they understand that concept [05:05] but once your dog's conditioned to it [05:06] you can do something like this [05:08] down cue free and just hand it to him [05:11] because he knows it means release and [05:13] reward so if he wants to get up after he [05:14] gets the treat he can do that [05:16] climb then the queue and i did not mark [05:20] that one that's okay [05:21] sit then the queue notice the leash [05:24] didn't get tight when i use the q [05:25] because it's a q [05:27] oops let's get that back to you big guy [05:30] sit q free reward [05:34] down then the queue oh free i didn't [05:37] have to step on it it's not [05:38] force the more we can communicate with [05:41] our dog the more techniques we have to [05:42] communicate with our dog [05:44] the faster they're going to learn and [05:45] the stronger the relationship is going [05:47] to be [05:48] you don't want to ignore a technique as [05:50] valuable as leash pressure [05:52] simply because you think it's force when [05:54] it's not if you notice [05:56] i'm not using force to get him to do [05:58] these things it's just a cue [06:00] sometimes i don't even have to place my [06:01] foot on the leash because the dog has [06:04] learned the process of going with that [06:06] pressure [06:07] so we're going to do a couple more and [06:08] this is another big question i'm asked [06:10] is [06:11] sit when i'm training my dog [06:14] free when i'm training my dog am i just [06:18] doing sitting down over and over [06:20] again no because that would be kind of [06:21] boring we want to make it fun [06:23] so we want to do as many different [06:26] things as possible when i'm doing a [06:27] session with a dog [06:28] i'm doing everything trying to make it [06:30] fun so we're going to incorporate these [06:31] cones as well [06:32] it's in one of my other videos and [06:34] that's the around command [06:36] which helps with certain sports but it's [06:37] also fun just to work with the dog to [06:39] give them more awareness of their own [06:40] body [06:42] so now i'm not going to say now anymore [06:44] but when you're first starting say [06:46] now after you say the command will help [06:48] you with your timing [06:49] because again your mind and your body [06:51] want to move at the exact same time he's [06:53] trying to offer up behaviors [06:54] i mean think about it however old you [06:56] are your entire life you've been [06:58] pairing your physical with your verbal [07:00] and now i'm telling you not to do [07:02] something you've been practicing your [07:03] entire life [07:04] for example when you go to talk to your [07:06] friends let's say you're asking to go to [07:08] movies you go hey guys you want to go to [07:09] movies [07:10] nobody does this hey guys you want to go [07:13] to movies [07:16] not it's not how we operate so you have [07:18] to go against [07:20] what you've been practicing your whole [07:21] life so we're going to do a couple more [07:23] come [07:23] then the queue free [07:27] then the reward round [07:30] than the q three good [07:34] and sometimes i just like to have them [07:36] go around these mark and reward [07:39] good boy very nice [07:42] good job backwards follow exercise i [07:45] might throw that in [07:46] giving them some rewards center we're [07:48] going to throw the center command in [07:50] boom and now let's walk and have them [07:52] enjoy that center position see if we [07:54] could get a little bit of that prancing [07:56] by holding the food slightly higher [07:58] sometimes you can get that prance [08:00] now we can throw in a down then the q [08:02] free [08:03] reward good spin cue [08:06] free reward heel cue [08:10] whoa i messed up come on buddy we're [08:13] this way [08:14] now i got them in heel position i can [08:16] give them lots of rewards for [08:17] maintaining that [08:18] sit then the queue down q [08:22] free reward all done buddy [08:25] and when we finish a session sometimes [08:27] it's nice to let them know that you're [08:28] done [08:29] and if you do it like this if you do it [08:31] correctly [08:32] you're gonna find that your dog is going [08:34] to start beating you into the positions [08:36] before you give that physical cue so [08:38] you'll be standing there [08:40] and you got your dog motivated ready to [08:42] learn and you say down [08:44] and your dog goes down before you [08:46] present the physical cue [08:47] boom now you know you have it on verbal [08:49] but if you don't do it this way [08:51] if you go sit down if you do that your [08:54] dog will never learn the verbal command [08:57] and you will always have to use the [08:59] physical cue [09:00] so one of the things i like to do to [09:02] test how good the dog knows the verbal [09:04] command [09:05] is i will place them on a climb platform [09:08] climb [09:10] and then he's not at this point but i [09:13] would stand [09:14] looking away and i give the dog the [09:16] commands [09:17] and i want to see if the dog can perform [09:19] the commands without me [09:20] actually presenting a physical cue and [09:23] i'm going to give you a quick little [09:24] demonstration with my dog ari [09:26] down stand [09:32] sit spin [09:37] center free yay [09:57] you ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2021-02-17_Very_Reliable__Easy_to_Teach_Stay_Command__Dog_Training.

Place your dog in a position of your choice. When your dog breaks that position, you will calmly say “wrong,” casually walk to your dog, grab the leash and use the leash-pressure to place your dog back into the position that was just broken. Once your dog is back in the desired position you will praise and pet your dog (petting is optional), but don’t give your dog a treat or toy reward. The reason for this, is that some dogs will break the position on purpose, so they can get the reward when placed back into the stay position. You must say “wrong”, or whatever word you choose, the moment (first second) your dog breaks the position, and you only say “wrong” once for each offense—even if it takes you a few minutes to get your dog back to the position that they just broke. You will continue to do this step until your dog either stops moving or goes back to the position they just broke on their own after you say “wrong."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 138/841,"” This will prove to you that your dog knows what is expected, and that your dog knows how to turn off pressure by complying. Once your dog shows you this behavior, you can then (if you choose) use corrections (positive punishment) for reliability. As a side note: when teaching a stay, we do not say ""stay,"" the stay is implied when you put your dog into a commanded position. However, some people feel more comfortable saying the word “Stay”. If that’s the case with you, feel free to use the word as it won’t negatively impact the training. When I place a dog into the stay command, I have three ways of releasing them from the stay. • One: we can use our release word. For my dogs that word is ""break"". • We can use our terminal marker which predicts release and reward. For my dogs that word is ""free"". • Lastly, we can give the dog a new command, such as ""come"" or ""heel”. I’m often asked how I teach my dogs the release word “Break”. You can introduce the (release) word the same way you introduced the terminal marker. The only difference is that the release word doesn't always predict a reward like the terminal marker does. You can also say the release word and then follow it with verbal praise and excitement. I’ll also squat down when I praise to encourage the dog to come to me. This quickly teaches a dog the release word. We can also use leash pressure to help teach our dog what behaviors are not acceptable, as explained earlier in the manual. For example: let’s say you don’t want your dog to be on your bed. When your dog jumps up on the bed, you can say “wrong” or “off” and then use the leash pressure to remove the dog from the bed. This is an easy way to teach your dog boundaries without having to implement positive punishment."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 139/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we're going to be teaching our [00:01] dogs the stay command now if you've been [00:02] following along the last few episodes [00:04] with spock [00:05] you know we've taught our dogs the [00:07] markers now this is a word or sound that [00:08] predicts a reward [00:09] we've taught the continuation marker as [00:11] well as the terminal marker [00:13] then we start to show our dogs what [00:15] behaviors we wanted them to perform [00:16] by implementing luring once a dog does [00:19] the behavior [00:20] we mark and reward and that takes us to [00:22] the next step which was teaching our [00:24] dogs how to turn off pressure by [00:25] complying [00:26] by implementing a technique known as [00:28] leash pressure [00:29] this is incredibly valuable and it's [00:31] going to be one of the tools that we're [00:32] going to be using [00:33] in order to teach our dogs the stay [00:35] command then we start to put all the [00:37] behaviors on a verbal command making [00:39] sure we say the verbal command [00:41] before we present the physical cue so it [00:43] becomes a predictable pattern [00:45] for our dogs and today we're going to [00:47] show them how to maintain a position [00:49] we're going to pay them for duration and [00:51] we're going to make it as clear [00:52] as possible now if you saw my last stay [00:55] video [00:55] you'll know that i use the word node to [00:57] pinpoint the moment [00:59] harley made a mistake and then i was [01:00] able to use the leash to reinforce the [01:03] behavior we were asking harley to [01:04] perform today with spock i'm going to be [01:06] doing it slightly different [01:08] but we're still going to be implementing [01:10] the science of dog training which is [01:12] the most important thing when we're [01:13] using a technique so the only difference [01:15] in today's video is [01:17] instead of saying no when spock breaks [01:20] the position [01:21] i'm going to simply re-command the [01:23] position [01:24] that spock was on so if he breaks the [01:26] climb i'm going to say climb [01:28] within one second of him breaking the [01:29] position then i'm going to reinforce it [01:32] by using the leash pressure this is a [01:34] way that a lot of my friends like to [01:36] teach the state command [01:37] so instead of saying no we say the [01:39] command but either way if you think [01:40] about it the process is the same [01:42] and to the dog it's really the same [01:45] thing so it's [01:46] personal preference do you want to say [01:48] wrong do you want to say no [01:50] do you want to repeat the command as [01:52] long as we follow through with that [01:53] physical cue afterwards or reinforcing [01:55] the stay [01:55] we're going to get really nice results [02:01] we have spock and we're going to start [02:03] with the climb command i always like to [02:05] start with the easiest command first or [02:07] the easiest stay rather [02:08] you don't want too many distractions [02:10] when you're first working the stay as [02:11] your dog gets better [02:12] then we can start adding more [02:14] distractions or we can start doing [02:16] stays that are a little bit more [02:18] difficult than the climb so i like to [02:19] start with the climb [02:20] and then maybe next i would do the down [02:22] stay then the sit stay [02:23] then maybe the heel stay stand stay [02:26] again we progress [02:27] as our dog is proficient at the exercise [02:30] so i'm going to tell spock climb then [02:33] i'm going to do the cue [02:34] yes i'm using my continuation marker [02:38] and now i'm gonna reinforce the stay as [02:41] i walk away i'll use my continuation [02:43] marker and i'll come back and reward him [02:44] if he breaks the position i'm gonna say [02:46] climb [02:47] and then i'm gonna place him back on yes [02:50] so instead of walking away and having to [02:52] tell our dog stay a bunch of times we [02:53] walk away casually [02:54] if they're doing it nicely yes then we [02:57] walk back and we reward [02:58] also a common mistake that people make [03:00] is they'll start to walk away [03:02] and when they're ready to reinforce they [03:04] do this [03:06] yes as they walk back towards the dog [03:09] now it's just like driving you want to [03:13] say the marker then change direction to [03:15] reward your dog [03:16] so instead of going yes like that which [03:19] is a very very common mistake [03:22] what we want to do is we want to walk [03:23] and say yes and then turn and walk back [03:26] just like everything else we want the [03:28] verbal to precede that physical cue [03:31] and the physical cue at this point [03:32] delivering the reward yes [03:34] is my movement back towards spock to [03:36] give him the reward [03:38] now he's doing really well and i've done [03:40] the stay with him once before so this is [03:42] only his second stay exercise and as [03:46] long as you're clear with your dog it [03:47] becomes very easy [03:48] what we're going to do now is we're [03:49] going to add a distraction all right [03:51] here we go [03:52] jet yeah jet nice job [03:55] climb there's the one command and i put [03:57] them back up nice job [03:59] so we have an added distraction here and [04:02] spock is still doing a really nice job [04:04] yes [04:04] good even with the distraction i'm gonna [04:06] give a little jet here a treat too [04:09] oh we dropped it there you go buddy and [04:11] he is super [04:12] super oh climb i messed up i was too [04:15] excited about the puppy [04:16] okay good job they're both puppies so [04:19] it's super fun [04:20] all right let's give them both the treat [04:22] and see if we can get [04:24] spock to break again now one of the [04:26] things i like to do [04:27] i often talk about this as i set dogs up [04:29] for success [04:30] yes so i can reward them climb the [04:33] moment they do the behavior [04:35] correctly but we also set them up to [04:37] fail [04:38] so we can reinforce what we want the [04:40] moment they make the mistake so what i [04:42] like to do is i like to squat down [04:44] climb there's the climb i grab the leash [04:48] and i guide him back on now when your [04:50] dog breaks the position you don't want [04:52] to reward them right away when you place [04:54] them back on the climb [04:55] because what some dogs will do is [04:56] they'll offer up the bad behavior so you [04:59] can reinforce it and give them a reward [05:01] so they'll break just to be placed back [05:03] on to get a treat [05:05] you can place them back on and you can [05:06] tell them good boy you could pet them [05:08] verbal praise but let there be a little [05:10] bit of time in between [05:12] reinforcing the stay and giving your dog [05:15] the reward so right now is a good time [05:17] i can reward and let's see if i can get [05:19] spock to break again by squatting down [05:21] yes he did it really nicely he did not [05:24] break the position [05:25] very good now we're going to see we're [05:28] going to take it up another level we're [05:29] going to see if we can get spock [05:30] to do a down stay as well so he still [05:33] needs help with the physical cue [05:35] maybe we'll see down okay so i'm gonna [05:37] cue him into the position [05:39] i would have marked and rewarded so now [05:40] he's in a down stay so now if he breaks [05:42] the position i'm gonna say [05:44] d.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 141/841,w down [05:50] good [05:53] all right and spock's doing pretty good [05:57] so far on the down stay [05:58] had to reinforce it a little bit but [06:00] same thing if he breaks the position we [06:02] say [06:02] one down and then we reinforce it again [06:05] the difference between what i'm doing [06:06] with spock [06:07] and what i did with harley was with [06:09] harley i just used the word no [06:11] that preceded the leash pressure and i [06:13] used that one word to reinforce [06:15] every single stay but with spock what [06:17] we're going to do is we're going to [06:19] re-command the position that he breaks [06:21] so again if you think about it [06:22] it's the same whether we're saying no or [06:24] we're saying wrong or we're repeating [06:26] the command [06:27] whatever you want to do that makes you [06:28] most comfortable again as long as you're [06:30] implementing that science of dog [06:31] training [06:31] so again i'm going to set him up see if [06:33] he'll break the position by squatting [06:34] down [06:35] and if he's doing really well we can yes [06:38] and then go back and reward him [06:40] and also a no can override a yes if [06:43] you're going back to reward your dog and [06:44] your dog breaks the position don't give [06:46] him the reward because then you're going [06:48] to be reinforcing [06:49] the breaking of the position and you'll [06:51] be doing the exact opposite of what [06:53] you're trying to do [06:54] we're going to walk around a little bit [06:55] more he's doing really well [06:59] again as the dog gets better increased [07:01] distance down [07:03] so i said the one command i bring him [07:05] back [07:07] and i nicely put him back into the [07:09] correct position [07:11] good boy now that he's going to hold it [07:13] for a few seconds we can mark with yes [07:16] and we can go back and reward get it [07:18] right there buddy [07:19] right there he doesn't know how to take [07:21] it from my hands yet [07:23] all right good job we're going to do a [07:24] tiny bit more and then that's going to [07:26] be a good session [07:27] walking around maybe squatting down if [07:29] your dog is getting really good you can [07:31] start throwing toys past them [07:32] just adding whatever sort of distraction [07:37] oh he's thinking about breaking and [07:40] we're going to come up to him and we are [07:41] going to go [07:42] down i was about to release you too [07:46] we wait a second look at these two [07:49] cute adorable puppies and now we're [07:50] going to release him [07:52] break yeah good boy come on buddy good [07:55] job very nice right there [08:01] when i teach the climb command for the [08:02] first couple weeks what you want to do [08:04] is you want to release your dog [08:06] when you're close enough to touch them [08:07] you don't want to release your dog when [08:09] you're far away [08:10] you want to develop the habit of the dog [08:12] understanding that you have to be close [08:13] to them to release them [08:14] and the reason for this is if you start [08:16] releasing your dog right away [08:18] when you're doing the climb command from [08:19] a distance your dog is going to [08:21] anticipate that [08:22] and when you get a certain distance they [08:23] are going to release themselves from [08:25] your stay [08:26] command so again for the first couple [08:28] weeks we want to make sure that we [08:29] release our dogs when we're done with [08:31] the exercise [08:32] right next to them and you may have [08:33] noticed i used the word break break is [08:35] just a release word [08:36] all it's telling spock or any dog that i [08:38] work with that they are released [08:40] from the stay command it doesn't predict [08:42] a reward therefore it's not a marker [08:44] it's just a release [08:45] and the way i teach it is exactly what [08:47] you saw right there i say break then i [08:48] go yay [08:50] e and the dog will usually jump out and [08:54] come over look at this guy isn't he [08:56] just the cutest but that's it it's [08:58] really simple just be patient [09:00] be calm make sure you know what you're [09:01] going to say when your dog breaks the [09:03] position [09:03] reinforce it and remember dog training [09:06] is supposed to be fun [09:07] see you guys in the next one [09:30] [Music] [09:37] you ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2021-02-24_Key_Search_Trained_in_One_Day__Dog_Training_.

Before starting this make sure your dog has completed the training in the following videos: ►► Marker Training: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph4ltXDVhHQ&t=153s Spacing out rewards: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2OBoptftYs&t=2s ►►Proactive Dog Training: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEU6gM_sHYI&t=8s ►►Down Command: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmgjNWDif1k&t=628s Command from a Distance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUeTJtjbLGY&t=477s ►►Stay Command: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5iD8eN89bo&t=125s Before we start training our dogs, we must know what motivates them. With any dog I start training, I like to begin with food and luring. Now, something I’m often asked by people is, “How do I train my dog when my dog doesn’t have any food motivation?” First, let me start by saying that every dog has food motivation, what varies is how intense the food motivation is. If you have a dog with low food motivation, there are techniques that you can use to increase that food drive. Most dog’s low food motivation is caused by a few things: Either the dog has been overfed, free-fed, given very high value food such as cooked steak, or sometimes just feeding out of a bowl can cause this. As a result, the dog just doesn’t care that much about getting fed as a reward. A common technique that we like to use to correct a lack of food drive is food deprivation."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 144/841,"For this you will want to use mealtime as a training time. Bring the dog out and offer food to train, if the dog is not interested, no big deal, put the food away and try again at dinner. Again, if the dog is not interested, put the food away and try again the next day. Continue to do this until your dog is willing to work for the food. Be sure not to give the dog any food between training. The dog has to know that he will only get food that he works for. I’ve used this technique on dozens of dogs and it’s worked every time. When we first start teaching a new command to a dog we start with continual reinforcement. Meaning, we reward the dog for the completion of every behavior we are teaching. Once the dog is performing the behavior on the command alone without the help of the physical cue, we then start spacing out the rewards. The idea is that the dog must believe there is a possibility that he will receive a reward, but not that he will always receive a reward. Another way to look at it is when you first start training a dog, you are a vending machine. Every dollar (behavior) your dog puts in, they get their reward. Once your dog knows the command you must transition to a slot machine. Meaning, every dollar (behavior) your dog puts in, no longer guarantees a reward, but the hope is there. Just like people continue to put money into a slot machine, your dog will continue to perform behaviors for the possibility of the reward. Once your dog is performing a behavior on the command alone, you can start spacing out the rewards. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 145/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] and one day i'm going to attempt to [00:01] teach my dog ari [00:03] how to successfully find my lost keys [00:08] now ari's normal diet consists of raw [00:10] frozen food [00:11] but since i'm going to be teaching her a [00:13] new command we're going to be using [00:14] continual reinforcement [00:15] and because of that i've weighed out [00:17] approximately eight ounces [00:19] of freeze-dried coated kibble that i can [00:21] use during the training process today [00:24] puppies first step we want to get our [00:27] dog interested in the key so i'm going [00:29] to treat it just [00:30] like the hand touch technique you've [00:31] seen in some of my other videos [00:33] so i'm going to present it to her once [00:34] she touches it with her nose i'm going [00:36] to use my terminal marker and deliver a [00:38] reward that's going to be the first step [00:39] so here we go i'm going to show her that [00:41] i got the keys [00:41] and then i'm going to move back free all [00:43] right so she touched it i marked [00:45] free creating a strong positive [00:47] association well make her work for it [00:49] make her work for it free good [00:53] go climb all right simple enough now i'm [00:56] gonna throw it and i'm going to try to [00:58] make it interesting and exciting [00:59] that she's going to want to go to the [01:01] keys once she gets her nose directly [01:03] over the keys that's when i'm going to [01:05] use my terminal marker [01:06] break [01:10] oh she didn't see it [01:17] well we're not not going as smoothly as [01:19] i hoped are you [01:22] three good good girl [01:26] very good [01:31] three very good make it easy so they can [01:34] see [01:35] [Music] [01:38] free excellent very nice ari [01:42] of course we're going to want to put a [01:44] command on this help me find them ari [01:45] where'd they go here they are [01:47] no that's a poopies come here and one [01:50] more [01:53] free good girl excellent [01:56] and that's all i'm gonna do for the [01:57] first step [02:01] step two we are going to introduce our [02:03] dogs to the command i'm going to be [02:04] using the command find it with this [02:06] exercise you can say the command [02:07] multiple times it's a little different [02:08] from teaching a sitter or down [02:10] because our dog's actively trying to [02:12] search to find the keys you're going to [02:13] want to place your dog on a climb [02:15] platform then you're going to take the [02:16] keys [02:17] toss them once they land tell your dog [02:18] to find it again whatever command you [02:20] choose [02:21] once your dog gets to the keys and looks [02:23] at them that's when you're going to use [02:24] your terminal marker and reward your dog [02:26] it should look something like this [02:30] find it free good [02:33] girl very good [02:37] once once they're back on the climb [02:39] you're gonna toss it again [02:43] free i'll take it it wasn't perfect all [02:46] right go climb [02:50] all right taking the keys one more time [02:52] and tossing them [02:55] find it she went right past it [03:01] free good girl excellent nice job [03:07] come on baby [03:10] i'm gonna make this one a little bit [03:11] harder and i'm gonna throw it a little [03:12] farther this time so we're gonna take it [03:14] and toss it over there [03:17] find it free [03:20] very good ari and for the last one [03:24] let's get a nice close-up all right go [03:27] climb [03:30] all right excellent and i'm going to [03:32] take the keys and toss it right in front [03:34] of you guys [03:37] and i'm going to tell ari find it [03:42] free very good ari nice job [03:46] all right [03:52] now we're going to teach our dog the [03:53] indication the way i'm going to do that [03:54] is basically the exact same thing we did [03:56] on the last step [03:57] but when our dog gets the key is instead [03:59] of using our terminal marker right away [04:01] we are going to tell our dog what we [04:03] would like them to do [04:04] for the indication for aria i'm going to [04:06] tell her to down so once she gets to the [04:08] keys [04:08] i'm going to say down once she lays down [04:11] terminal marker reward [04:12] we're going to do maybe three or four of [04:13] these here we go [04:17] find it down free [04:20] good very good [04:26] climb [04:29] find it [04:30] [Music] [04:34] down free very nice ari good [04:38] girl very good [04:46] find it [04:57] [Music] [05:00] so close [05:04] [Music] [05:08] she's really working [05:12] [Music] [05:15] down free very nice ari we're gonna get [05:19] one more [05:22] nice and close [05:26] all right [05:30] find it [05:39] free perfect and that one she indicated [05:42] all on her own [05:48] for this step we're going to do one [05:49] thing slightly different from the last [05:51] step [05:51] instead of throwing the keys i'm going [05:53] to act like i place it in three [05:54] different locations of course i'm only [05:56] gonna place it in one of those three [05:58] then i'm gonna tell her to find it once [06:00] she finds it [06:01] i still may have to help her by telling [06:03] her to down and then giving her the [06:04] terminal marker [06:05] and i may also make her hold the [06:07] position we'll see let's play by ear [06:09] but you're going to see exactly how i'm [06:10] going to do this so i set down like i'm [06:12] setting [06:13] something there i'm setting something [06:16] here [06:17] and i'm setting something here and then [06:20] i tell her find it [06:24] or find it [06:28] find it [06:29] [Music] [06:33] okay go climb so she's having a little [06:36] bit of a hard time so i'm going to show [06:38] her the keys to let her know what's [06:39] going on [06:40] remember okay so now she knows what's [06:44] going on [06:45] all right we'll do it one more time [06:49] and i think she saw it but that's okay [06:53] find it [06:54] [Music] [06:56] good and then i'm gonna trade the keys [07:00] for the food [07:01] go climb all right we're gonna do one [07:05] more [07:06] so boom maybe i put it there maybe i put [07:09] it right here [07:12] maybe i put it back over here [07:15] who knows where i put it i don't know [07:17] find it [07:18] [Music] [07:24] good good girl and again we'll do a [07:28] trade [07:29] go climb all right come on baby ari [07:32] get your butt over here don't make me [07:33] look bad all right [07:35] one last one and then we'll be able to [07:37] move on to the very last step [07:39] so i'm gonna bring it a little bit [07:40] farther this way [07:45] maybe i'm putting it right there we [07:46] don't know maybe right there [07:50] and maybe right here find it [07:56] good and again i'll do a little trade [07:59] take the keys give her some treats okay [08:08] we're on the last step what we're going [08:09] to do for this is i'm going to take the [08:10] keys [08:11] as if i was just out on a walk you know [08:13] and i'm not paying attention and maybe [08:15] i go to grab my phone and when i grab my [08:18] phone i accidentally drop my keys [08:20] and i get home and i go oh no where are [08:22] my keys good thing i have ari she's [08:24] going to come out and help us find it [08:25] all right we have ari here [08:27] and we're gonna tell her find it [08:43] [Applause] [08:49] and she found him [09:00] [Music] [09:26] you ==================================================

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 154/841,"ly/2OdVa52 ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ I also like to teach a marker that signals negative reinforcement. This is very useful when teaching the stay command or if you wanted to teach your dog to not jump on the furniture. This helps your dog to learn what they can and can’t do without receiving a form of positive punishment. The type of negative reinforcement that it predicts is leash pressure. In this video, I'll use the word “Wrong”. This part of the training only requires that we teach our dog the terminal marker. The exercise goes as follows: • Get your dog’s attention. • Once your dog is looking at you, you use your clicker. • Deliver the reward. Note: the marker sound must come before you move to deliver the reward. If you click while you’re giving the dog the reward, your dog will never become conditioned to the sound. • Wait until your dog eats the first reward and looks back at you. Again, use your clicker, followed by moving away from your dog, encouraging your dog to come and get the second reward. When doing this exercise, I prefer to go back and forth between handing the pup the reward and making the dog come and get the reward. I also recommend switching your supply hand and your distribution hand. You will continue to do sessions of this exercise until your dog is conditioned to the clicker. When done correctly most dogs will become conditioned within a day or two. Ivan Pavlov knew his dogs were conditioned to a marker because they’d salivate. The way I test a dog to see if it’s conditioned is I will say or click the marker (the sound that predicts the reward), and instead of giving the reward, I watch them for any changes of behavior. These are the four most common: • Opening their mouths • Salivating • Licking their lips • Moving their paws On the other hand, if all they give you is a blank stare—you’ll know they’re not conditioned."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 155/841,"Now that your dog is conditioned to each marker, you may be wondering how long you have to deliver the primary reinforcer before you lose the connection. Well, you have as much time as the dog is paying attention. This could be any length of time until the dog is distracted (if a rabbit runs by and catches your dog’s attention, you’ve lost it). This means you don’t have to rush the delivery of the reward. Next, when using a marker make sure your dog is doing a behavior that you like. Don’t make the common mistake of using the marker to get your dog’s attention. Meaning, your dog is not paying attention to you, so you use the marker to get your dog to look at you. Even though your dog looks at you after you say the marker, the dog was actually being rewarded for looking away from you. Lastly, if you use your marker, you must pay your dog with the primary. A marker only has value because it ALWAYS predicts the primary reinforcer."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 156/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] normally when i train a dog i use verbal [00:02] markers meaning [00:03] i say yes which means the dog's going to [00:05] receive a reward or i say free which [00:07] means a dog is released and they're [00:09] going to receive a reward [00:10] but i'm often asked by people how can [00:12] they do the training by using a clicker [00:14] a clicker is a very common tool that's [00:16] used in the dog training industry so [00:17] i've been using the clicker with a young [00:19] puppy and i'm going to demonstrate today [00:20] exactly how i like to teach [00:22] a young puppy and how i like to use a [00:24] clicker in my training [00:25] when i'm using a clicker instead of [00:27] having two markers the continuation [00:28] marker and the [00:29] terminal marker for my dogs i use yes [00:31] and free [00:32] with a clicker i treat it as a terminal [00:35] marker so that means the click [00:36] means the dog is going to receive a [00:38] reward but they're also released from [00:40] the position [00:40] if i want to work on duration in a [00:42] position so if i am working a stay [00:44] instead of using a continuation marker i [00:46] simply use verbal praise [00:48] so i'm going to start working with jet [00:50] here he's a young puppy and the moment [00:52] he does the behavior when he completes [00:53] it so [00:54] his butt hits the ground click his [00:56] elbows hit the ground for the down click [00:58] he completes the spin click he jumps on [01:00] the climb click [01:01] so pay attention to when i click with [01:03] the clicker [01:04] and also just like our yes and our free [01:06] every time you click [01:08] you owe your dog a reward remember the [01:10] click is just like a paycheck it only [01:12] has value [01:13] because it always predicts the reward [01:15] and with him since he's a young puppy [01:17] and it's new training [01:19] we're going to be using continual [01:20] reinforcement so i'm going to reward [01:22] every single correct behavior from him [01:25] i'm going to use a combination of leash [01:27] pressure [01:28] as well as luring also notice how i say [01:31] the command [01:32] before i present the physical cue and i [01:34] click [01:35] before i give the dog a treat so i'm [01:37] going to start with climb [01:38] then the q there's the click [01:41] sit cue click [01:46] another thing that helps quite often [01:48] when i'm doing this is [01:50] because it's difficult to hold the [01:51] clicker the treats as well as the leash [01:54] so what i like to do is i take the leash [01:57] i put my middle finger through it and [01:59] then i wrap it around my two fingers [02:02] and then i can hold the clicker and i [02:03] have control of the leash so we're going [02:05] to do some more commands [02:06] down then the q i'm going to use the [02:08] leash [02:13] very good buddy off then the queue [02:18] sit then the queue good [02:22] hey buddy buddy spin then the q [02:28] down then the q [02:34] very nice little man i also like to [02:37] incorporate the come when called so [02:39] we're going to say come [02:40] and then back up stop and lift [02:43] click reward very good we're going to [02:46] guide him into heel position by stepping [02:48] back with our left foot using the leash [02:49] to help guide as well [02:51] bring him around back in the heel boom [02:53] click for that [02:54] we're gonna ask him to sit lift click [02:56] oops i clicked a little early there [02:58] that's okay [02:59] down then the cue there's the click [03:02] remember click is releasing him climb [03:04] then the queue [03:06] boom so you have to be good at clicking [03:09] the moment your dog does the behavior [03:10] correctly [03:11] let's ask for a sit good boy [03:15] i'm going to do another down this time [03:16] i'm going to use luring instead of the [03:18] leash [03:19] down then the q very nice [03:22] very very good my little man so you can [03:25] see if you've watched some of my other [03:27] training videos [03:29] if i wasn't using the clicker it would [03:31] be this [03:32] now you're going to see how i'm going to [03:33] replace the click with [03:35] free and that's how i train most of my [03:37] dogs so if i was using my voice [03:39] i would say off free [03:42] then reward oops i dropped it come then [03:46] the q [03:48] free then the reward spin hey [03:52] free reward so once again go back to the [03:56] clicker climb [03:57] then the queue boom there's the click [04:01] sit good remember it's release and [04:04] reward so now let's say i want to do the [04:06] climb stay [04:07] i want to start working on a little bit [04:08] of that duration getting the dog to [04:10] maintain the position [04:11] i don't like to use the word stay so i [04:13] don't walk away saying stay to a dog [04:15] you can if you like it won't negatively [04:17] impact the training but it's not [04:19] necessary [04:20] once we place our dogs on a commanded [04:22] position the stay is implied [04:24] so i have him on a climb stay right now [04:26] and if i'm going to walk away and i want [04:28] to reinforce the climb stay instead of [04:29] saying stay [04:30] i just say climb even though he's on it [04:33] so he jumps off [04:34] i would say wrong i would grab the leash [04:37] guide him back [04:38] up good boy now if you've seen my other [04:41] stay videos i don't like to reward them [04:42] right away if they break the stay [04:44] but after they hold it for a few seconds [04:46] i can give them a reward [04:48] so instead of saying yes or clicking i'm [04:50] just going to give verbal feedback [04:51] so i'm going to step back good boy [04:54] build more distance good wrong grab the [04:58] leash and again you can use whatever [04:59] word you like [05:00] so i was actually working with a client [05:02] the other day and he preferred to use [05:05] stay instead of wrong how can i [05:07] incorporate stay well if you want to [05:08] incorporate stay [05:10] instead of saying wrong when your dog [05:12] breaks the position [05:13] say stay the moment your dog breaks a [05:15] position so watch how i do it [05:18] stay then i come back and put them on [05:21] so now stay is actually predicting [05:24] something [05:25] that's the most important thing when [05:26] we're working with our dogs we have to [05:28] make sure [05:29] each word predicts something our words [05:31] mean [05:32] what they predict good boy so i can use [05:35] a verbal marker too if i want i can say [05:37] yes [05:38] nice job or what i do is just good boy [05:41] very nice [05:41] verbal phrase praise wrong or stay [05:45] whatever word you want to use [05:46] bring him back good boy very good after [05:49] he holds it for a few seconds [05:50] we can reward again wrong [05:53] take the leash i prefer to use wrong so [05:55] i'm going to use that come on big guy [05:57] so i'm using the lesion by telling him [06:00] wrong the moment he jumps off the [06:01] position and we put him back [06:02] on it teaches him what he needs to do is [06:05] either stop what he's [06:06] doing or go back to the previous [06:07] position when your dog understands that [06:09] and you say [06:10] wrong or stay or whatever word you [06:12] choose your dog will either freeze [06:14] or go back into the same position [06:16] another thing to keep in mind [06:18] climb when i give a dog a command such [06:22] as [06:22] come for me it doesn't mean come to me [06:26] what it means is a position so let me [06:29] let me show you what i mean by that so [06:31] right here if i bring him to me come [06:33] here big guy [06:34] this that's come that position [06:38] just like this [06:42] is center that's a position [06:46] this is heel [06:49] well a little sloppy heel but that's a [06:51] position and again [06:55] that's a position climb so if i had a [06:57] dog that was [06:59] 20 feet away that dog is going to come [07:01] to me if i say center [07:03] or if i say heal or if i say come you [07:06] can use whatever commands you like [07:08] we'll just do a few more of these and [07:09] that'll be a good session for this guy [07:11] sit good boy [07:14] down [07:18] very good i'm gonna have him come off [07:23] excellent nice work buddy sit [07:27] good heel [07:31] very good good [07:38] good job down [07:41] excellent now he's warming up sit [07:45] very good buddy off [07:49] good and remember we want to make the [07:51] training [07:52] really fun and really engaging for the [07:54] dog so i'm often doing a lot of [07:56] different commanded positions remember [07:57] it's not just [07:58] sit down sit down sit down sit down sit [08:00] down the entire time that's going to be [08:02] boring [08:02] you want to incorporate the sit off [08:05] stand down [08:06] come heel center spin walking backwards [08:10] all these different things is going to [08:11] make the training more interesting more [08:13] fun [08:13] therefore in the long run your dog's [08:15] going to do better because they're going [08:16] to enjoy it more and you're going to [08:18] have an overall better performing dog in [08:20] all these different commands [08:27] [Music] [08:39] you

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 160/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another q a if you're [00:02] new to my channel the way i like to do [00:04] the questions and answer videos [00:05] is i will put all the questions in the [00:07] description below with the time stamps [00:09] so you can jump to that section [00:11] of the video so you don't have to listen [00:13] to the entire thing [00:14] let's go ahead and get started question [00:16] number one [00:17] should i reward my dog when he's [00:19] learning commands and [00:21] intentionally does a behavior during the [00:23] training even if i didn't ask him to do [00:25] it [00:26] that's a great question because when [00:27] you're doing a lot of this free [00:29] shaping or fix shaping and you've been [00:31] working with the markers and trying to [00:33] build a proactive dog [00:35] then you're going to have a dog that [00:36] offers up behaviors in order to get a [00:38] reward that shows us that our dogs are [00:41] learning and they're starting to figure [00:42] out what gets them to those rewards what [00:44] they're after [00:45] well when you're working with your dog [00:46] as long as your dog is not [00:48] breaking any commanded positions that [00:50] you're currently working on then it's [00:52] okay to reward them when they offer up [00:54] behaviors [00:54] this does help create that proactive dog [00:57] the dog that [00:58] understands that their behavior has an [00:59] effect on their environment [01:01] this is what that opera conditioning is [01:03] all about that's really [01:04] what it is so i do like to reward a dog [01:07] when they offer up behaviors that i've [01:09] been teaching them [01:10] however i would not reward the dog if i [01:12] had them [01:13] in a commanded stay and they broke that [01:16] state position [01:16] in order to offer up a new behavior so [01:19] for example [01:20] if i had my dog in a down stay and my [01:22] dog sat [01:23] because he was trying to offer up that [01:25] behavior to get a reward [01:26] i wouldn't reward that since it would be [01:28] breaking or violating the rules of the [01:31] downstay [01:32] a situation should dictate whether or [01:33] not you're going to reward your dog if [01:35] they offer up behaviors but [01:36] for the most part as long as they're not [01:38] already in a commanded position or [01:39] commanded behavior then it should be [01:41] okay [01:42] the one time i might be a little bit [01:43] more cautious of rewarding a dog [01:45] constantly when they're offering up new [01:47] behaviors during a training session [01:49] is if i have a very very high energy [01:51] high motivated [01:53] dog that tends to move a lot anyways for [01:56] those types of dogs [01:57] we might want to slow them down a little [01:59] bit and ask for more duration in [02:01] positions and not reward them as often [02:04] for jumping from one position to the [02:06] next because then the stays might become [02:08] a little bit more difficult [02:10] in the future the next question is [02:13] i'd love to get some tips on helping my [02:15] puppy achieve healthy play with other [02:16] dogs [02:17] this is a real common problem that a lot [02:19] of people run into and it's when you [02:21] have those full contact [02:22] players the ones that like to jump and [02:24] wrestle around with other dogs [02:26] now if that is the case you want to [02:27] teach your dog some sort of balance or [02:29] manners when playing with other dogs [02:31] i was actually thinking of doing a video [02:33] on this in the near future [02:35] titled if this then that so if your dog [02:37] does this [02:38] based on where they are in training how [02:40] you should respond to that [02:42] so if it's a new dog and it sounds like [02:44] it since it's a puppy [02:46] what i like to do is teach the dog the [02:48] concept of leash pressure i have videos [02:50] on this [02:51] it's using negative reinforcement we [02:53] teach the dogs to go with the pressure [02:55] of the leash so we can use the leash as [02:58] a tool to communicate things we want or [03:00] things we don't want [03:01] so when i'm teaching a dog certain [03:03] behaviors that i don't want them to [03:04] perform [03:05] i like to use the word wrong you can use [03:07] whatever word [03:08] you like wrong comes before leash [03:11] pressure [03:11] then i will use no no comes before [03:14] positive punishment if i'm using [03:16] positive punishment on the dog that i'm [03:17] training [03:18] so let's go back to the wrong wrong [03:20] precedes leash pressure therefore wrong [03:22] predicts leash pressure [03:23] i want the dog to understand that when [03:25] they hear me say wrong they should stop [03:27] what they're doing or go back into the [03:28] previous position [03:30] we teach them that by implementing this [03:32] when they break the stay [03:34] or when they're doing behaviors that we [03:35] don't want if you've seen my stay video [03:38] i tell the dog no this was harley [03:41] often i'll use wrong but as long as [03:43] you're consistent with that dog it [03:44] should be okay so with harley i was [03:46] using no to predict leash pressure [03:48] she would break the climb stay i would [03:50] say no i would walk over to her [03:52] grab the leash and place her back on the [03:54] climb after enough repetitions of this [03:56] when she broke the climb and i said no [03:58] she would go back on her own that's [04:01] basically what we're trying to do and i [04:03] use this for so many different [04:04] situations so let's go back to using the [04:07] word wrong [04:08] the dog or puppy jumps up on the couch [04:10] and let's say i don't want them on the [04:11] couch i would say wrong [04:13] apply the leash pressure cueing them off [04:14] the couch once they're off the couch [04:16] turn the pressure off good dog [04:18] the dog jumps up on people wrong i would [04:21] apply the leash pressure once all four [04:22] paws are back on the ground good dog and [04:24] go back to petting and rewarding that [04:26] dog for them doing the behavior [04:27] correctly [04:28] the dog goes to chew on the furniture [04:29] wrong apply leash pressure the dog stops [04:32] chewing on the furniture we turn off the [04:33] pressure [04:34] good dog so this gives us an opportunity [04:36] to show our dogs what we want them to do [04:38] and what we expect or what we don't want [04:40] them to do [04:41] without jumping right into positive [04:43] punishment we want to give them an [04:45] opportunity [04:46] to learn what's expected of them before [04:48] they're giving any sort of consequence [04:50] and remember negative reinforcement is [04:51] not a punishment it's reinforcing [04:53] certain behaviors that we want [04:55] i like to use the same thing when the [04:57] puppy or the dog is playing with another [04:59] dog once they get to a point where [05:01] they're starting to play [05:02] too hard i have a couple options i could [05:04] say the wrong [05:05] which at this point should mean stop [05:07] what you're doing or go back to the [05:08] previous position [05:09] use the leash pressure if i need to [05:11] enforce it [05:12] and then i can often redirect the dog to [05:15] a new commanded position [05:17] so for example i like to use the climb [05:19] command so i would get the two puppies [05:21] allow them to play or a puppy and a dog [05:23] as long as they're good playing together [05:25] and once the dog or the puppy starts to [05:27] act to [05:28] a point that i don't like that is not [05:30] acceptable [05:31] then i would say the wrong and i would [05:33] cue the dog off of the play [05:35] often like i said i probably redirect [05:38] the dog onto the climb [05:39] once a dog or the puppy starts to learn [05:42] that there's a certain point in which [05:44] you will always reinforce what's [05:46] expected [05:47] then your dog will stop the intensity or [05:50] they will calm down once they start to [05:52] get to that level [05:53] now this could take a lot of repetition [05:55] so you have to be very patient with it [05:57] and you have to follow through every [05:58] single time i don't like to use any form [06:01] of positive punishment on a dog when [06:03] they're actively [06:04] engaged with another dog or another [06:07] human because i don't want them to think [06:09] that it's the other dog or the other [06:10] human causing the correction [06:12] which could create some sort of conflict [06:14] again i'd rather just keep it simple use [06:16] a relief [06:17] pressure redirect to what i want and [06:19] then we can continue to reinforce from [06:20] that point [06:21] which will teach the dog what the [06:23] expectations are and what they are [06:24] allowed to do and they're not allowed to [06:26] do [06:26] also keep in mind the concept of [06:28] generalization the dog being generalized [06:31] to the training so just because you do [06:33] it inside your house or in your backyard [06:35] doesn't mean your dog is going to [06:37] respond or listen when you take your dog [06:39] to your friend's house that has another [06:41] dog or anywhere else where your dog [06:43] might be interacting with other dogs [06:45] and in order to get them generalized [06:47] usually on average about eight or nine [06:49] new locations new scenarios [06:52] where the dog is being told and [06:54] reinforced expectations that the dog [06:56] becomes generalized an example would be [06:58] the climb command [06:59] you tell your dog to climb inside the [07:01] house then you tell your dog in the [07:02] backyard then in the front yard and [07:04] climb into the truck [07:05] climb onto this park bench climb onto [07:07] this big boulder while we're on a hike [07:09] you have your dog climb on multiple [07:10] different objects until your dog starts [07:13] to understand that when you say climb [07:14] they just have to go to an elevated [07:16] position [07:17] this is why competition obedience dog [07:19] trainers will train their dogs in [07:21] multiple environments [07:22] so when they go compete the dog knows [07:25] what to do and performs correctly [07:26] even though they're in a new environment [07:28] because they've been generalized [07:30] it's the same concept with training a [07:31] service dog [07:33] all right next question any advice for a [07:35] puppy with low food drive is there a way [07:37] i can increase her food drive [07:38] she seems to get bored after a minute of [07:40] training but i want to make sure she [07:42] gets enough food [07:43] if i'm trying to make meal times [07:45] training times [07:46] now not every dog is going to have a [07:49] high [07:49] food drive i do like to use meal time as [07:52] training time in the beginning stages [07:54] when i'm first teaching a dog new [07:56] behaviors [07:57] that's when we're using continual [07:59] reinforcement meaning we're rewarding [08:00] every single correct behavior [08:03] once our dogs start to do the commands [08:05] on the verbal alone [08:07] then i start to space out rewards but [08:09] sometimes you might find yourself [08:11] working with a dog that just doesn't [08:12] have that much food drive [08:14] and is not that interested in training [08:16] you could do your best to try to [08:17] increase the food drive by not free [08:19] feeding [08:20] not giving your dog very high value [08:22] rewards and [08:23] bringing your dog out for training if [08:25] your dog loses interest you put the food [08:27] away and don't feed again till [08:29] later in the day during dinner's [08:31] training session or [08:32] the next day when you train this is [08:34] going to show your dog that they have to [08:36] work in order to get [08:37] the food which normally will increase [08:39] the food drive [08:41] however if you find yourself struggling [08:43] to get your dog [08:44] enough nutrition because you feel like [08:45] your dog's not working hard enough to [08:47] get the food [08:48] then you can start to space out the [08:49] rewards give your dog a normal full meal [08:51] outside of training [08:53] and if your dog is not doing the [08:54] commanded exercises in order to gain [08:56] access to the reward because [08:58] that's what reward based training is [09:01] limited [09:01] by how much the dog wants the reward [09:04] that we're offering them [09:05] and this is when we use leash pressure [09:07] we always want to think about those four [09:09] quadrants of opera conditioning [09:10] positive reinforcement negative [09:12] reinforcement positive punishment [09:14] negative punishment [09:15] we all we want to use all four when [09:17] necessary with the dog and i talk about [09:19] this in a lot of my videos [09:20] but just a refresher remember negative [09:23] means taking away positive means adding [09:25] punishment means preventing a behavior [09:27] from being repeated [09:29] and reinforcement means encouraging a [09:32] behavior [09:32] to be repeated so positive reinforcement [09:34] we give our dog something of value so [09:36] they redo the behavior [09:38] negative reinforcement we turn pressure [09:40] on when they comply we turn it off [09:42] reinforcing the behavior we're asking [09:43] them to do it's not a punishment [09:45] negative punishment taking something of [09:47] value away you're petting your dog your [09:49] dog jumps up you stop [09:50] petting your dog goes back down to the [09:52] ground you implemented negative [09:54] punishment you took away the petting [09:56] something that the dog saw was valuable [09:58] and once all four paws were back on the [09:59] ground you go back to petting or your [10:00] dog didn't sit so your dog doesn't get [10:02] the treat and then positive punishment [10:04] would be anything we're adding to the [10:06] equation to stop a behavior as long as a [10:08] dog doesn't like it [10:09] you can use it if it's of course humane [10:12] and conducive to the training so for [10:15] example [10:16] yelling at a dog would be positive [10:18] punishment it's not something i [10:19] recommend i always advise against [10:21] yelling at our dogs because it doesn't [10:23] keep them in a clear mental state [10:24] therefore they don't learn as fast or as [10:26] effectively [10:27] if they're worried about what the human [10:28] is going to do but that's an example of [10:31] positive punishment [10:32] shaking a jar of coins is an example of [10:34] positive punishment [10:36] popping the leash on the dog's training [10:38] collar another example of positive [10:40] punishment when we're adding to the [10:42] equation to try to stop or eliminate a [10:44] behavior [10:45] so in this situation we were using the [10:47] negative reinforcement [10:49] and the positive reinforcement when our [10:51] dog is willing to take [10:52] the rewards and if they're not willing [10:54] to take the rewards and i'm going to [10:55] follow through with the negative [10:56] reinforcement the big difference between [10:58] the two is positive reinforcement the [11:00] dog has a choice negative reinforcement [11:02] the dog does not have a choice they have [11:04] to comply so that will help us [11:06] get more reliability even if we're [11:08] working with a dog that may not have [11:11] as high of a food drive as we would like [11:13] any advice on communicating [11:15] variations from strict heal to loose [11:17] leash expectations [11:19] this is a great question and remember [11:21] when we teach our dog something our [11:22] words mean what they predict or what we [11:25] enforce based on the commands [11:26] with my dogs i have three different [11:29] loose leash [11:30] or heel commands that i like to use and [11:32] i highly recommend if you want to have a [11:34] variation [11:35] so number one this is if you're doing [11:38] any sort of competition level obedience [11:40] or if you really want to have that nice [11:42] focused heel for my dogs i use the [11:44] command heel when i say heel my dogs [11:46] have to be on my left side [11:48] and proper heel position looking up at [11:50] my face that's [11:51] the entire picture that i want if i'm [11:53] walking the dog has to walk and maintain [11:55] that position again while looking at my [11:57] face [11:58] also our body language is going to help [11:59] our dogs understand what the [12:01] expectations are based on the different [12:03] exercises [12:04] then i also have a with me so with me [12:06] for my dogs means [12:08] stay in the heel position but you no [12:10] longer [12:11] have to look in my face and we can do [12:13] that simply [12:14] by reinforcing expectations but [12:17] changing our body language when i'm [12:20] doing a focused heel with a dog it's [12:22] more strict it almost looks military [12:25] and the dog can pick up those distinct [12:27] differences in our body language [12:29] for my with me it's more relaxed i'm [12:32] more chill therefore the dog [12:34] understands that and they're able to [12:35] pick up on that it's much easier to [12:37] teach than you may think [12:38] and then the very last one that i have [12:40] is let's go let's go is kind of like my [12:43] informal [12:44] my dogs can be anywhere they want around [12:46] me as long as they're not pulling on the [12:48] leash [12:48] and for me it doesn't matter what length [12:50] the leash is it is as long as they're [12:52] not pulling on it so if i have a 20 foot [12:54] long line and i'm on a hike and my dog's [12:56] not at that off leash status yet [12:58] then i can use the long line to dictate [13:01] the space that my dog has the freedom to [13:03] go to [13:04] but not pulling or going beyond that [13:06] 20-foot long line same thing if i had a [13:08] six-foot leash the dog can go anywhere [13:09] they want around me [13:11] as long as they're not pulling on the [13:12] leash and it's very easy to reinforce [13:15] if you've taught your dog the concept of [13:16] leash pressure we have to be sensitive [13:19] to the leash pressure if we want our [13:21] dogs to be sensitive to the leash [13:23] pressure [13:24] something i often run into when i'm [13:26] doing private lessons [13:27] the human is not aware of the leash [13:30] pressure and therefore the dog is not [13:32] aware of the leash pressure meaning if [13:34] you keep constant tension on the leash [13:36] because you're worried about your dog [13:37] running or pulling [13:39] then you're not being sensitive to the [13:41] leash pressure and neither is your dog [13:42] your dog's going to continue to pull and [13:44] they're not going to respond [13:45] to the leash if you do the step-by-step [13:48] process that i teach in my leash [13:49] pressure videos [13:50] and you constantly focus and make sure [13:52] you you are aware of when the leash [13:54] pressure is being turned on and when [13:55] it's being turned off you can use that [13:57] as a very very effective tool to [13:59] communicate [14:00] so many different things to your dog so [14:02] every time you have your dog out be [14:04] aware of that [14:04] the leash pressure when it's getting [14:06] tight when it's not remember when your [14:07] dog is in the position you want them to [14:09] be in you want them to maintain [14:11] when they're doing things correctly [14:12] there should be zero tension on the [14:14] leash [14:14] they should have to choose to maintain [14:16] that and if they leave it or they break [14:18] the rules then you can use the leash [14:20] pressure to reinforce it [14:21] i'd like to see how you use the e-collar [14:23] everyone seems to use it a little [14:25] differently and the more opinions and [14:27] styles i have to cross-reference the [14:29] better thanks [14:31] i do use remote training collars on my [14:33] own dogs there are [14:34] two main ways or most common ways that [14:37] most people teach the remote training [14:39] collar [14:40] if you're using a remote training collar [14:42] to stop behavioral issues as long as the [14:44] behavioral issue is not based on fear [14:46] you can use a remote collar to correct [14:48] the dog and stop that behavior right [14:50] away [14:50] let's say your dog digs into the trash [14:53] or digs in the backyard [14:54] anything that could be life or [14:57] potentially dangerous for your dogs you [14:59] often want to correct those or stop [15:01] those right away and getting into the [15:02] trash could be one of those [15:04] so you place the remote training collar [15:06] on your dog the moment your dog sticks [15:09] their head into the trash can you [15:10] stimulate the collar then you get to be [15:12] the good guy oh what happened buddy [15:14] did that trash can bite you probably [15:17] should stay away from that trash can [15:19] and now your dog will avoid the trash [15:21] can but it is different when we're using [15:23] it for [15:24] obedience when we're using it for [15:26] obedience if you look at the behavioral [15:27] issues and obedience issues if your dog [15:29] sticks their head into the trash and [15:31] feels a stimulation from the collar they [15:33] can easily [15:34] associate that feeling to the activity [15:36] they were doing when they were corrected [15:38] but if your dog is in a down stay let's [15:40] say and you ask your dog to come to you [15:41] and your dog chooses not to come to you [15:44] and you stimulate the collar your dog is [15:46] not going to be able to connect [15:47] that correction with anything they were [15:49] doing because they were just [15:51] laying there they can't associate it [15:52] like to digging or getting into the [15:54] trash [15:55] that means when we're using a remote [15:57] collar for obedience is a process that [15:59] we have to go through to get the dog to [16:01] become directional to the training [16:03] collar [16:03] meaning they understand that it's a [16:05] correction coming from the human and [16:07] it's not some [16:08] mystery force or some random bug biting [16:11] them on the neck [16:12] if you were to correct the dog that was [16:14] in the down hanging out and you called [16:15] them to you and they chose not to come [16:17] you corrected them [16:18] usually the dog will do one of two [16:20] things run away from whatever's trying [16:22] to bite them on the neck or run to the [16:24] human and go please help me i don't know [16:26] it's biting [16:27] my neck and even though you may want [16:28] your dog to come to you [16:30] your dog coming to you in fear and panic [16:32] trying to get away from whatever was [16:33] biting them on the neck is probably not [16:35] the best thing for training [16:37] and our growth and development of the [16:39] dog's obedience and proficiency [16:42] what would it be better or what is [16:44] better is to teach the dog to be [16:45] directional to the collar so again [16:47] there's two main ways of doing this that [16:49] people like [16:50] to do one is pairing the remote collar [16:53] at a very very low stimulation level [16:56] with [16:57] leash pressure into each commanded [16:58] position [17:00] you want to make sure if you're doing it [17:01] this way that the stimulation on the [17:03] collar is so [17:04] low that it's not seen as a correction [17:06] it's seen as [17:08] negative reinforcement pressure is [17:10] turned on when the behavior is complied [17:12] the pressure is turned off [17:13] so let's say a dog's working level is [17:17] 15 out of 127 so the collar that i like [17:20] to use [17:21] is dogtra e-collar technology is also a [17:24] good one but dogtra is [17:25] my preferred go-to and they go from zero [17:28] to 127.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 161/841,[17:29] so you can really pinpoint your dog's [17:31] working level [17:32] so let's say this dog that i'm working [17:34] with is working at a 15 that's the dog's [17:36] correction level [17:37] it's high enough to get the dog to stop [17:39] doing bad behaviors but it's not so high [17:42] that it creates any sort of avoidance [17:44] well if i was using the leash pressure [17:46] technique then i would probably take the [17:47] collar down to about a six [17:50] so it's enough that the dog can kind of [17:52] feel what it is but it's not so much [17:54] that it causes a discomfort [17:56] because it's a cue to get our dog to do [17:58] the certain behaviors [17:59] so what trainers will do is they'll give [18:01] the dog a command such as sit [18:03] they'll go to lift up on the leash the [18:05] same way that i do my leash pressure [18:06] training [18:07] once the leash gets tight they will hit [18:09] the continuation button on the remote [18:11] collar at that very very low level [18:14] once the dog sits they turn off the [18:16] pressure from the leash and the remote [18:17] collar at the exact same time [18:20] then they will do they cue the dog [18:22] with the leash once it gets tight they [18:23] stimulate the collar [18:25] once the dog gets to them they release [18:26] the pressure and they release the [18:27] stimulation [18:28] from the collar and they'll have the dog [18:30] going to every single different position [18:32] using that combination of [18:34] leash pressure with the continuation [18:35] button on the remote collar this will [18:37] help make the dog become directional to [18:39] the collar and it'll also teach the dog [18:41] what they need to do [18:42] if they feel the stimulation on the [18:44] collar what a lot of people will use the [18:46] remote collar for is [18:47] only they'll strictly use it just for [18:50] come when called [18:51] so they'll teach the dog with the leash [18:53] pressure in a long line come they'll do [18:55] the leash pressure they'll pair it with [18:56] the stimulation of the collar on [18:58] continuous so it's continuing to correct [19:00] until the dog gets to them then they [19:02] turn that off so then the dog learns [19:04] every time they feel that sensation if [19:06] they want it to go away they come to the [19:08] handler [19:09] and then it goes away the way that i use [19:11] a remote collar is not so much [19:13] pairing it with the leash pressure and [19:15] using negative reinforcement [19:17] i use it strictly as positive punishment [19:20] so if i'm going to correct a dog and i'm [19:22] training that dog on a remote training [19:23] collar i pair [19:24] every single leash pop with a [19:27] stimulation from the remote training [19:29] collar [19:29] so let's say the dog has been training [19:31] long enough that this particular dog [19:33] knows all the commands [19:34] knows stay knows what he's supposed to [19:36] do or what he's not supposed to do [19:38] and i start working with him with the [19:39] remote collar when he breaks any of the [19:41] rules whether he doesn't stay [19:43] he doesn't listen to a certain command [19:45] he tries to pull on the leash [19:46] i will say no then i will pop the leash [19:49] the exact [19:50] moment the leash pops i stimulate the [19:52] collar now when we're doing this we want [19:54] to keep the leash attached to a flat [19:56] collar or a martingale collar [19:58] because at this point the pop is no [20:00] longer meant to give the dog any form of [20:03] correction the correction is coming from [20:04] the remote training collar [20:06] when we pop the leash it's giving that [20:08] dog the direction [20:10] and we want to make sure that it's light [20:11] enough that it doesn't [20:13] over stimulate the correction from the [20:14] remote training collar [20:16] if you pop a leash too hard while [20:18] pairing it with the stimulation from the [20:19] collar [20:20] the dog will only feel the leash pop and [20:22] they won't feel the stimulation from the [20:24] collar so the leash pop becomes very [20:25] light [20:26] only to give the dog direction while the [20:28] correction comes from the remote collar [20:30] i'll usually pair every single [20:32] correction with the remote collar for [20:34] two weeks [20:35] at that point i will take the leash off [20:37] and i will test to see if the dog is [20:39] directional to the remote training [20:41] collar [20:41] if the dog responds correctly then i [20:43] know the dog's directional [20:44] if they don't if they respond how i [20:46] discussed earlier when the dog either [20:48] runs away from whatever's biting them on [20:50] the neck or runs between your legs [20:52] saying please help me then the dog's not [20:53] directional [20:54] i put the leash back on and i would go [20:56] back to working with the dog [20:57] pairing every leash pop with the [20:59] stimulation on the collar making sure [21:02] we say our nose at the right time so for [21:04] example [21:05] i tell the dog to sit the moment the dog [21:07] doesn't sit i would go [21:08] no pop the leash up stimulate the collar [21:11] sit [21:12] reassist the dog or after i command it [21:14] we will assist them into the position [21:16] then good dog [21:17] so the way i do any sort of corrections [21:19] once i'm at the point of adding [21:20] corrections to this dog [21:22] or whatever dog i'm working with it's [21:23] always no [21:25] then the correction then we recommand [21:28] then we assist [21:29] no correction recommand assist in that [21:32] order [21:32] so dog breaks a stay no correction [21:35] recommand [21:36] climb assist or the downstate no [21:39] correction [21:39] down assist we don't want to continue to [21:42] correct over and over for the same [21:43] mistake [21:44] for example i wouldn't ask a dog to jump [21:46] into heel position [21:48] and the dog doesn't go into heel [21:49] position and go no correction [21:51] heal no correction heal no correction [21:54] heal [21:54] that would not be good because once we [21:56] start adding corrections to [21:58] get that 100 reliably trained dog [22:01] then we have to make sure that we always [22:02] give them an opportunity to learn [22:04] because even though you may think your [22:05] dog knows it perfectly [22:07] once you start adding corrections it [22:09] changes the entire thing up the dog goes [22:11] hey i thought we had a deal we're [22:12] working it this way now you're changing [22:14] the rules [22:14] and they be they can become slightly [22:17] stressed it is [22:18] mildly stressful once we start adding [22:20] corrections within the training [22:22] so we want to make sure that we always [22:23] help and assist our dogs [22:25] when they do it incorrectly after we [22:27] recommand [22:28] so again let's say you tell your dog to [22:30] come dog doesn't come [22:31] no correction come assist climb the dog [22:35] doesn't climb [22:35] no correction climb assist the dog [22:38] breaks a climb [22:38] no correction climb assist so always in [22:41] that order [22:42] and that's pretty much how i teach my [22:44] dogs the remote training collar [22:46] check out the video that i attached to [22:48] the question to see my dog ari wearing [22:50] her remote collar [22:51] and to see that as long as you do it [22:54] correctly you're not going to have any [22:56] of the negative side effects that you [22:57] may see [22:58] or hear about online like i saw an [23:01] article called the shocking truth to [23:03] shock collars [23:04] this is the way i like to look at it and [23:06] often when you see these types of [23:08] blog posts or articles it's by dog [23:12] trainers that are purely positive dog [23:14] trainers now what sounds better [23:16] coming from a professional's perspective [23:18] let's say you're the client you ask me [23:20] hey i want to use a remote training [23:21] collar [23:22] on my dog how do i do that and i say [23:24] it's not a good tool you shouldn't use [23:26] that what would be better is to just use [23:28] purely positive and get your dog to do [23:30] it [23:31] that way that's the correct way or would [23:33] this sound better [23:34] you know i really don't know how to use [23:36] a remote training collar i've never used [23:39] it i've never been [23:40] taught and since i have zero application [23:43] on the training tool i can't show you [23:45] how to do it [23:46] so which one sounds better of course the [23:50] one where they say oh that's a bad tool [23:51] don't use it instead of they don't know [23:53] how to use it appropriately [23:55] they are tools to communicate and when [23:57] used correctly they're the safest most [23:59] effective most humane training tools [24:01] you can use with your dog we noticed [24:03] that she seems to have the strongest [24:05] bond with me [24:06] the oldest brother and follows me around [24:08] the house and not much with anyone else [24:09] in the family is this normal [24:12] yes it is normal for dogs to become more [24:14] attached to one person than [24:16] everybody else for example my two dogs [24:19] ari and charlie they're pretty much [24:21] with me everywhere i go if i'm walking [24:23] around the house they're following me if [24:24] i'm in the bathroom they're waiting [24:26] outside the door wondering [24:27] when i'm gonna come out so we can go [24:28] outside and play fetch or do obedience [24:30] if i'm in the kitchen they're looking at [24:32] me and that's normal because i've [24:34] trained them i worked with them i [24:35] imprinted them [24:36] i have the strongest relationship with [24:38] them out of anybody [24:39] and this is always going to happen so if [24:41] you're working with your dog or your [24:42] puppy more than everybody else in the [24:44] family [24:45] your dog is going to become more [24:48] attached to you in a sense or your dog's [24:50] going to follow you around more [24:52] and seem to be more attached to you same [24:54] thing happened when i was a kid growing [24:56] up we had a family dog and even though [24:58] it was the family dog it was really [25:00] my dog the dog slept in my room slept on [25:03] my bed [25:04] i took the dog out for walks i played [25:06] with the dog outside no one else really [25:08] did that so the dog became more attached [25:10] to me so again [25:11] it's completely normal not a big deal i [25:13] wouldn't stress it out too much [25:14] if they want the puppy to be a little [25:17] bit more attentive to them then [25:19] have them give the puppy or the dog a [25:21] reason to be more attentive to them [25:23] whether through training [25:24] playing just hanging out with the dog [25:26] should often help as well [25:28] our dog gets stressed in the pen when we [25:30] eat clean or sleep [25:32] how do we fix that this is going to be [25:34] the same as a dog [25:35] whining in the crate in the very [25:37] beginning when we're working with a very [25:39] very young [25:40] puppy if they're separated from their [25:42] litter they will [25:43] whine it's a natural thing that they do [25:45] in order to get the group to come back [25:47] so they can be safe since they can't [25:49] really take care of themselves [25:50] once they start getting a little bit [25:52] older they could use that as a form of [25:54] manipulating the humans to let them out [25:56] of the crate or the puppy pen whatever [25:58] it is [25:59] we always want to make sure we reward [26:01] our dogs when they're doing what we want [26:03] we don't want to reward them [26:05] with something that they want when [26:06] they're doing a behavior we don't like [26:08] such as [26:08] whining in the crate or whining in the [26:10] puppy pen if [26:12] i have a puppy that i'm working with and [26:13] that puppy is whining [26:15] in the pen and i let the pup out then [26:18] i'm reinforcing [26:20] the whining what would be better is to [26:22] wait till the puppy stops [26:24] whining then praise them and let them [26:26] out so they learn that it's the act of [26:28] not [26:28] whining or barking or pouting in the [26:31] crate [26:32] is what gets them out of the crate or [26:34] the pen so we just have to make sure we [26:36] always reward our dogs when they're [26:38] doing the behavior that we want [26:39] and this brings me to a point about [26:41] clickers or our verbal markers [26:43] remember our markers pinpoint a moment [26:45] in time when our dog is correct or [26:47] incorrect [26:48] a common mistake people do with their [26:50] markers is they'll have their dog [26:52] let's say in the backyard running around [26:54] playing they call their dog to them [26:56] the dog doesn't come they look outside [26:58] and they don't see the dog anywhere [26:59] they're like where is my dog [27:02] i know i can get the dog to come to me [27:04] i'm going to use this terminal marker so [27:05] they go free [27:06] or they click whatever it is and the dog [27:08] comes cruising from behind the backyard [27:11] shed [27:11] and runs over and goes i'm here where's [27:13] my reward and they give the dog [27:15] the reward but when the dog heard the [27:18] sound the dog was actively [27:21] digging behind the shed so now the dog [27:23] thinks [27:24] that digging is a good thing and it [27:26] should be repeated because that's when [27:28] the human used the terminal marker to [27:29] get the dog to come to them [27:31] so again always remember we reward our [27:33] dogs when they're doing behaviors that [27:35] we like [27:36] so those become the behaviors that they [27:38] offer up and not [27:39] the unpleasant ones that we don't like [27:41] our dog doesn't respond to commands that [27:43] well when we don't have treats [27:44] i know it's a long process but any tips [27:46] on getting him to listen when there [27:48] isn't any food involved would be great [27:50] okay so this is normal when we first [27:53] start working with our dogs we do that [27:54] continual reinforcement we reward every [27:57] behavior [27:57] but something that i highly recommend [27:59] everybody [28:00] do with their dogs is what's known as [28:02] free shaping this is when we don't have [28:04] anything in mind we want our dogs to [28:06] perform [28:07] but when they do something that we like [28:09] we use one of our markers and we reward [28:11] them for that behavior [28:12] so you're hanging out your puppies [28:14] walking around or your dog and your dog [28:15] goes and lays on their bed [28:17] let's say you like that behavior you [28:18] could click and reward or say free again [28:20] whatever sound you're using for your [28:22] markers [28:23] and let's say your dog looks at you you [28:25] can mark and reward that let's say your [28:26] dog lays down you mark and reward that [28:28] whatever behaviors your dog does that [28:30] you like [28:31] you mark and reward without your dog or [28:34] your puppy [28:34] knowing that you have rewards on you so [28:37] the rewards are not [28:38] visual to the dog they just do behaviors [28:40] that you like and you mark and reward [28:42] this will teach your dog that their [28:44] behavior [28:45] can make rewards magically appear [28:48] and this is incredibly powerful it's [28:51] known as creating a proactive dog [28:53] but it is part of that opera [28:55] conditioning so first i would highly [28:57] recommend doing [28:58] that next thing is teaching the dog [29:00] leash pressure because just like i [29:01] talked about earlier in the video [29:02] if you have a dog that may not always [29:04] perform for the reward that you're [29:06] offering them [29:06] then you want to make sure that you [29:08] still follow through and get them to do [29:09] what you're asking and the best way to [29:11] do that is [29:12] by using that negative reinforcement [29:13] it's not a punishment it's just telling [29:15] the dog if i tell you to sit [29:17] you have to sit i'll still give you the [29:19] treat [29:20] but you still have to sit and then we [29:22] follow through with that [29:23] so that's going to be the best way we [29:24] can help build the food drive a little [29:26] bit as discussed earlier [29:28] but then we can also use the leash [29:29] pressure reinforced commands that we're [29:31] asking the dog to perform [29:33] and last but not least we can use that [29:36] free shaping to help create a proactive [29:38] dog [29:39] incredibly powerful because again one [29:41] day your dog comes up to you and you [29:43] tell your dog to sit and your dog looks [29:45] at you and goes you know what [29:46] you might have a treat and your dog sits [29:49] because you've proven to your dog that [29:51] you could [29:51] magically have rewards appear at any [29:54] given time [29:55] so just because the dog doesn't see the [29:57] reward doesn't mean that you may not [29:59] have something for them [30:00] if they complete the task and remember [30:02] everything our dogs do is based on [30:04] motivation [30:05] they're either motivated to access [30:06] something pleasant or they are motivated [30:09] to prevent something unpleasant or the [30:10] behavior itself is fun [30:12] and dogs will always do whatever is most [30:14] motivating so make sure you present the [30:16] most motivating factor to your dog [30:19] to get them to do the behavior that you [30:21] prefer we need help getting our yorkie [30:23] to walk over to the door to let us know [30:25] that he has to go potty [30:26] how do we teach this if i'm teaching a [30:29] dog to have a signal to go outside i do [30:32] prefer to use something like a bell [30:34] you can use one of the bells that the [30:35] dog or the pup hits or you can hang [30:37] bells [30:38] on the door that they can ring to go [30:40] outside to let you know [30:42] but either way if you're trying to teach [30:44] your dog something like that it has to [30:46] be [30:46] cause and effect dog does this humans do [30:48] that [30:49] once the dog knows this then that's [30:51] going to influence their behavior to do [30:53] specific things so let's say you teach [30:55] the dog to ring the bell [30:56] or let's say you have a pad that you a [30:59] little elevated pad that you can use as [31:01] a climb let's say you don't want to do [31:02] the bell option [31:04] so you create a little climb platform [31:05] just big enough for the dog to sit on [31:07] not enough to lay and be comfortable [31:09] just to sit on that would be a cue to [31:11] let the humans know to let the dog [31:13] outside [31:14] when i teach a dog a cue to go outside [31:17] you have a couple [31:18] options you could teach them simple [31:19] cause and effect if you do this i will [31:20] let you outside every time [31:22] whether or not you have to go to the [31:23] bathroom you could just go outside to [31:25] play or because you saw a bird in the [31:27] tree and you want to check it out [31:28] or you could teach them that if they do [31:30] this they have to go to the bathroom [31:32] now the way that i teach the dog this [31:34] concept is once they know that sitting [31:36] on the platform or ringing the bell gets [31:38] them to go outside [31:39] once they do that behavior good dog i [31:41] hook the leash i take them to where i [31:43] want them to go to the bathroom [31:45] if they go to the bathroom yay nice job [31:47] good pup but we can even put it on a [31:49] verbal command at that point so you can [31:50] say do your business go potty [31:52] whatever it is once the dog goes to the [31:54] bathroom praise them and then do [31:56] something the dog enjoys this is [31:58] something i discuss in my potty training [32:00] video so we do something that the dog [32:01] enjoys at that point [32:03] if the dog does not go to the bathroom [32:05] no big deal we take the dog back inside [32:08] and we put him in the crate and we wait [32:09] 20 minutes after 20 minutes we take the [32:11] dog [32:12] back outside and wait for them to go to [32:14] the bathroom in the same spot i like to [32:16] wait three minutes i don't like to wait [32:17] much longer than that [32:18] so i'll stand in the spot with the dog [32:20] on a leash waiting for them to go to the [32:21] bathroom [32:22] if they go again praise them good job do [32:25] something the dog enjoys so going to the [32:26] bathroom predicts more [32:28] fun activities and if they don't go [32:30] repeat the process that i discussed [32:32] earlier [32:32] this will teach the dog that if they're [32:34] sitting on the platform or ringing the [32:36] bell to go outside that they have to go [32:38] potty it's not to just go play however [32:40] if they go potty [32:42] then they can play so cause and effect [32:44] and that's one of the best ways to do it [32:46] so [32:46] the easier one is going to be the [32:48] platform again just make a platform [32:51] maybe four inches off the ground big [32:53] enough for the dog to sit on but not [32:54] enough to lay down show the dog that [32:56] behavior [32:57] make them do that behavior every single [32:59] time before letting your dog go outside [33:01] once he or she starts to offer up that [33:03] behavior to go outside then follow [33:05] through with the process i just [33:06] explained and you should be able to get [33:08] your dog to the point [33:09] of indicating to go out to the bathroom [33:11] and to actually go to the bathroom [33:13] is there any way of building her [33:14] confidence up anymore or will this come [33:16] with time while working with her [33:18] when it comes to building a dog's [33:19] confidence we have a few things we want [33:21] to keep in mind confidence building [33:22] exercises counter conditioning and [33:24] desensitization so [33:26] confidence building and counter [33:27] conditioning they're very similar to one [33:29] another it's just confidence building [33:30] the dog doesn't already have an idea of [33:32] what they think it is whereas counter [33:34] conditioning [33:35] they already may have some sort of fear [33:37] and we're showing them that whatever it [33:39] is that predicts fear to them [33:40] shouldn't predict fear but rather [33:42] predict something pleasant let's say [33:44] you're working with a dog that [33:45] is afraid of the vacuum cleaner well [33:48] what i could do with the vacuum cleaner [33:49] is i could bring it up [33:50] out maybe take it apart introduce pieces [33:52] to the dog [33:53] reward the dog while seeing the vacuum [33:55] move the vacuum around mark and reward [33:57] and constantly build up the exposure to [33:59] it while having the vacuum predict [34:01] something pleasant like their food [34:03] that would be using a combination of the [34:04] counter conditioning and desensitization [34:07] with confidence building the dog doesn't [34:09] have any sort of [34:10] idea of what a certain situation is you [34:12] just expose them to so many different [34:14] situations [34:16] and new things while making it a [34:18] pleasant experience [34:19] so with my dogs i have i'll have them [34:21] walk on multiple different types of [34:23] surfaces while doing obedience [34:25] so gymnasium floor maybe bubble wrap [34:27] maybe gravel [34:28] concrete tile floor all these different [34:31] surfaces [34:32] while in the middle of training being [34:34] rewarded creates a strong positive [34:36] association to it [34:37] same thing with elevated positions so [34:40] what i like to do with puppies is i'll [34:41] hold them up [34:42] on a high platform i'll have them walk [34:43] keeping my hand underneath because i [34:45] don't want them to fall which could have [34:46] the opposite effect [34:47] and giving them rewards while they're [34:49] doing that setting up little puppy [34:50] obstacle courses [34:52] you may have seen this if you scroll [34:53] through facebook a lot [34:55] some breeders they will build a puppy [34:57] obstacle course and they'll have all the [34:59] puppies start on one end and they will [35:01] put the dog's food of the puppy's food [35:02] at the other end [35:04] and they have to go through this [35:05] obstacle course in order to get to their [35:07] reward [35:08] which builds their confidence all these [35:10] little things can build confidence so [35:11] again [35:12] simple way of putting it confidence [35:14] building is taking something that the [35:15] dog may [35:16] not know or have any experience with and [35:18] making it predict something pleasant [35:19] therefore creating a positive [35:21] association [35:22] whereas counter conditioning the dog may [35:23] already have some fear of whatever it is [35:26] and you recondition them in a sense to [35:28] this item by making it predict something [35:30] more pleasant [35:31] this would be the same when you're [35:33] working with a dog that's afraid of [35:34] fireworks or a dog that may be afraid of [35:36] gunshots [35:37] you know let's say you're getting ready [35:39] to move and you know you're going to be [35:41] moving next to a firing range i know [35:42] this is an extreme example [35:44] but let's say you're moving next to a [35:45] firing range and you know there's going [35:46] to be a lot of gunfire constantly and [35:48] you don't want your dog to be stressed [35:50] out [35:50] you would introduce your dog to the [35:51] gunfire at a distance that's far enough [35:54] away [35:54] not to over stimulate the dog and as [35:56] they become more comfortable with the [35:58] sound we can move closer and closer [36:00] while rewarding our dog creating that [36:02] strong positive association and [36:03] desensitizing them to whatever it is [36:05] that we don't want them to be afraid of [36:07] so that's what i would focus on anytime [36:09] i have a new dog i'm constantly trying [36:11] to build them [36:12] up to show them how strong how amazing [36:15] and how incredible they are i always [36:16] tell people think about that movie bolt [36:19] uh disney movie bolt the super dog he [36:22] believed that he could run really fast [36:23] he believed that he can shoot lasers [36:25] from his eyes he believed that he could [36:27] jump higher than any other dog and he [36:28] had a super bark he truly believed these [36:30] things because [36:32] they made him think that he believed [36:34] these things and that's the same thing [36:35] that i'm doing when i'm working with a [36:37] dog i make them believe they're strong [36:38] how do i do that [36:39] well let's say when i'm playing tug with [36:41] them the puppy shakes the [36:42] toy i go flying across the room or i [36:45] fall down and they jump on top of me and [36:46] we play [36:47] building a strong relationship and [36:49] building the dog's confidence and again [36:51] if you have a dog that's very confident [36:53] you're less likely to run into all the [36:54] issues that you may see from fearful [36:56] dogs such as [36:57] fear aggression fear biting not being [37:00] comfortable in new environments which [37:01] really can affect the relationship if [37:03] you're not able to do all these fun [37:04] activities that you [37:06] may want to do with your dog such as go [37:07] to the dog beach so counter conditioning [37:09] desensitization and confidence building [37:12] is a great way to increase your dog's [37:13] confidence and make them more [37:15] comfortable in new environments i have [37:16] an excellent article on socializing [37:18] which is really about getting a dog [37:20] comfortable in new environments i'm [37:21] going to put a link to that as well [37:23] in the description below i hope this [37:25] video was helpful and provided some [37:27] valuable information that you can start [37:29] implementing with your dogs thanks again [37:30] for watching [37:31] and i'll see you guys in the next one [37:41] you

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 165/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another episode today i [00:01] sit down with steve baxley who's been a [00:03] breeder of collies under the oversight [00:05] of the american kennel club [00:06] for over 45 years in 2017 steve [00:09] co-founded plumito service dogs [00:11] a non-profit organization that provides [00:13] healthy professionally trained [00:15] colleagues [00:15] to veterans with ptsd and children and [00:18] adults with autism diabetes [00:20] or epilepsy with his mentor dean doughty [00:23] between stephen dean there is more than [00:25] a century of experience with the kali [00:27] breed [00:27] that includes genetic testing training [00:30] raising and exhibiting according to the [00:32] akc standard for the breed [00:34] and this understanding leads them to [00:36] offer colleagues [00:37] that are capable of excellent service [00:39] work so you're training service dogs [00:41] mostly for [00:43] veterans that are suffering from ptsd [00:46] or some that have physical injuries as [00:48] well or are you primarily focused on [00:50] ptsd [00:51] um no some of them some of the veterans [00:53] also have heart trouble too [00:55] um we got a couple we have some veterans [00:57] that come back [00:58] um with severe depression and they [01:01] commit [01:01] try to commit suicide and if we find out [01:04] about this person they contact us [01:06] um when they know they're having these [01:07] issues we try to match them with a dog [01:09] that will prevent [01:10] actually prevent them from doing that we [01:12] have one guy [01:14] that has one of my dogs that that's four [01:17] um we have we do for autistic children [01:22] i worked at the savannah riverside for [01:23] 25 years as a [01:25] nuclear chemical operator so when i [01:28] retired [01:28] early um i started subbing at [01:32] schools and it seems like they always [01:34] put me in some time with the special [01:35] kids [01:36] or they mixed a lot of the autistic [01:38] children in with the classrooms [01:40] so a lot of these little guys would have [01:43] start to have a meltdown some of them [01:44] did have a meltdown [01:45] and i never knew anything about autism [01:48] but i noticed real quickly there was [01:49] something different about these kids [01:51] and so i always tried to diffuse a lot [01:55] of times the kids in class would kind of [01:56] agitate the [01:57] kids so i tried to defuse it so my heart [01:59] really started going out to autistic [02:01] kids and probably [02:03] out of all the people that um [02:06] i meet for these service dogs meet with [02:08] are autistic a lot of them are autistic [02:10] but we also do um diabetic alert dogs [02:14] and epilepsy like some people some of [02:16] the kids that have autism [02:18] also have epilepsy or maybe even the [02:20] diabetes too [02:22] we have a couple that have leukemia a [02:24] set of twins that have leukemia [02:26] um service dogs aren't just for the [02:29] person especially in a family [02:31] these dogs took so many different lives [02:33] the um parents [02:35] they make a huge difference in the [02:37] parent's life just having the dog in the [02:39] house and the [02:40] situations that are um pretty much a lot [02:43] of cases diminished [02:45] that they were having to deal with every [02:46] day now what is your process [02:48] when you have let's say you have a [02:51] litter you want all these puppies to be [02:53] service dogs you already have people [02:54] selected you're going to be working with [02:56] them throughout the entire process [02:58] you and your team does most of the [03:00] training is does your son [03:01] pretty much is he the head of the k9 [03:03] training department [03:05] he is the trainer at this point okay [03:06] perfect so then what is [03:08] what is your let's go over the [03:10] step-by-step process what do you how do [03:12] you do the imprinting at the beginning [03:14] how do you start doing your socializing [03:16] because i know we were talking about [03:17] that earlier and how important that is [03:18] to you [03:19] teaching the dogs how to play as well [03:21] allowing them to be puppies [03:23] you know trying teaching them crate [03:25] training for potty training but also not [03:27] keeping them in the crate 24 7.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 166/841,[03:29] right you know because it's not oh i'm [03:31] in the crate all the time and i come out [03:32] only to train [03:34] so there's a lot that goes into it [03:37] the best you can can you break down how [03:38] you guys do that over there [03:40] yeah i think so um grant is is my [03:43] trainer he went [03:44] like we mentioned maybe earlier he went [03:45] to tom rose and michael ellis so he got [03:47] a great mixture of [03:49] them both too my opinion two best [03:51] schools in the country yes [03:52] he learned so much from tom rose school [03:55] dave [03:56] and um his instructors that were there [03:58] and then he went [03:59] came all the way to california to see to [04:01] spend time with michael ellis at school [04:03] which he learned a lot more it's just a [04:05] well combination [04:06] of both and now he's kind of as most [04:09] trainers as yourself [04:10] you kind of like take some from this one [04:12] and that one and you kind of make it [04:14] your own they might be all different [04:16] methods but you make it your own how you [04:18] want to work it and [04:19] your own personality plays a big part [04:22] into it and relating to the dog [04:24] um so what grant does for me the day [04:27] they're born he's actually in the [04:28] welcome box with me [04:30] um this last letter we just had um [04:33] he was in there always touching their [04:35] feet [04:36] from day one turning them up upside down [04:39] um touching them and then when they get [04:42] where they can [04:43] feel a different surface surface maybe [04:45] about three weeks old [04:46] he has different grates he puts in the [04:48] box going to be walking on [04:50] um all kinds of toys [04:53] making noise they're set up in our [04:55] laundry room at our house so they hear [04:57] um the washing machine and wash [05:00] our washing machine and everything goes [05:02] all the time and dryer the buzzer is [05:03] going off [05:04] um constant exposure constant exposure [05:07] and i'm asking this too because a lot of [05:09] my viewers [05:11] are attempting or they're in the process [05:14] of training their own service dogs [05:16] okay so the more information that so i'm [05:18] not too worried about [05:19] the uh the the puppy culture yeah [05:22] but after that let's say from about [05:24] eight to ten weeks and beyond [05:27] what starts at that point what is grant [05:29] doing there what is the [05:30] the socializing aspect and the training [05:32] and the focus [05:34] unlike what i've always done as a [05:35] breeder um [05:37] he doesn't feed them out of a bowl they [05:38] have to work for um [05:40] their food which is bad as well been a [05:42] big adjustment for me because [05:44] i like little fat puppies he's like no [05:46] that's not good [05:48] so um anyway and it's really worked well [05:50] with this last letter [05:52] um he set up um [05:55] different obstacle courses um pretty [05:58] much like [05:58] you know probably you and michael ellis [06:00] michael i think he learned that part [06:02] from michael ellis where they'd run [06:03] through jump in a tub to get to their [06:05] food that's full of [06:06] all kinds of noisy things you need to [06:08] post a video of that i'll share it so [06:10] my audience can see because that is [06:12] something that i actually talked about i [06:13] believe in one of my q and a's [06:15] because people are always asking about [06:16] confidence building so i'm glad you [06:18] mentioned that and i said you know [06:19] there's a lot of breeders out there well [06:21] they will [06:21] build a little puppy obstacle course [06:24] nothing too challenging [06:25] but something that the puppy has to be [06:27] able to go through accomplish it in [06:29] order to get to their food [06:30] yeah and then that builds their [06:31] confidence and it does so much when you [06:33] have a confident dog [06:34] right it helps with the training it [06:36] makes everything significantly easier [06:38] yeah you know so contrary to the the [06:40] popular belief of making a submissive [06:43] dog [06:43] oh yeah it's great to expose them to all [06:45] kinds of noises we had people out on our [06:47] property with um [06:48] attacks i had rented some too tractors [06:51] and different things [06:52] i wrote them bulldozers i wrote them up [06:55] right beside the [06:56] um their exercise pin they were in [06:59] i put them right in from where we park [07:00] our car so when we pull up they hear the [07:02] noises of the cars [07:04] they really don't flinch it a whole lot [07:06] and that's what you want out of a [07:07] service dog you don't want really a [07:09] fearful dog [07:10] and um well they also feed off of the [07:13] parents [07:14] yeah you know so since you've been doing [07:16] it for so long and you've been [07:17] imprinting them [07:18] yeah and you have this really strong [07:20] line that [07:22] is comfortable in environments is [07:24] confident it's intelligent [07:25] you know they're able to learn things [07:27] really fast and it plays a big role when [07:29] you have these parents that are very [07:31] well balanced [07:32] very well adjusted and well trained [07:34] right because the puppies feed off that [07:35] the temperament [07:36] there's a loud noise and the parents are [07:38] like yeah it's no good it goes back to [07:39] the purpose [07:40] purposeful breathing you know the [07:42] genetics you know the parents [07:44] um these puppies both and i keep them as [07:47] long as [07:48] until the mother decides she don't want [07:50] to be around them anymore it's important [07:52] for the mother to be with them [07:53] i agree yep them puppies the only bowl [07:55] they ever ate out of [07:56] was out of her bowl she i mean i never [08:00] this is the first litter actually that i [08:01] ever didn't do the [08:03] mash up the food and wet it and all that [08:04] they ate they've been eating their [08:06] puppies [08:06] dry from day you know four weeks old [08:10] it's long as soon as they had teeth they [08:11] were crunching on the kibble [08:13] oh really with the mother yeah i'm [08:15] kidding and she stayed with them a good [08:17] until they were eight weeks old and just [08:20] one day she just like [08:21] got tired of them she didn't do anything [08:23] she just like quit going in there with [08:25] them [08:25] now you've i'm sure you've heard of the [08:28] sibling syndrome [08:30] or whatever they call it you know where [08:31] they recommend not [08:33] getting two puppies from the same litter [08:35] because there could be issues with that [08:37] so how do you guys work with that when [08:39] you're doing the service dog training [08:41] and you have [08:42] you know four dogs from one litter we [08:44] always separate the puppies when once [08:46] they start training [08:46] they're not together at all in fact [08:48] these puppies [08:50] um i started crate training at four [08:52] weeks old [08:53] oh wow so they were pretty young you [08:55] know this they fussed [08:56] they went in the same crate they were [08:58] beside each other which i think maybe i [09:00] might would do it differently next time [09:02] put them in separate rooms [09:03] um you'll find out with um [09:08] your puppy tonight how many training [09:10] sessions does [09:12] grant shoot for each day with the [09:14] puppies that are in training to be a [09:15] service dog [09:16] how often do you have the person if [09:18] they're local [09:19] so if you have someone who lives maybe [09:21] an hour away and you know they're going [09:22] to be getting the service dog how often [09:23] do they get to come down or do you wait [09:25] till the end [09:26] no do you do a course for them we prefer [09:28] it to be local because so we can do that [09:31] um it depends on the child like um [09:34] like with chance his 13 year old i [09:37] waited till chance was [09:38] probably eight months old and then i [09:40] talked to the mother to make sure that [09:42] she knew that her daughter would [09:44] understand when we took the dog away [09:46] but it's very important for him to to [09:49] meet [09:50] some people and dogs just don't mesh [09:52] very well together [09:53] so you want to match the person with the [09:55] right dog so that's very important [09:57] and actually when the day i took um [10:00] chance to auburn her name's aubry [10:03] she has autism very she's almost genius [10:06] she's very intelligent [10:08] the moment he walked in the room and saw [10:10] her and she kneeled down [10:12] he the way he reacted to her i've never [10:13] seen him react to anybody not even me [10:15] i mean he kissed her all over her face [10:17] she i mean it was [10:18] like it was perfect right perfect from [10:21] the beginning [10:22] and it happened what happened so much [10:25] is that the dad was like please please [10:27] let him stay well i couldn't [10:29] number one i require the dog to be [10:31] neutered you know before [10:33] i let him go but um he was begging me [10:35] for months [10:36] because he saw the difference he said [10:38] even after that first night [10:40] her meltdowns started diminishing and so [10:43] um he's like we gotta have that dog we [10:46] you know we got to have that i said well [10:47] we got to be we got to finish with him [10:48] first [10:48] so he went early he actually went [10:50] instead of going at 18 [10:52] months i think i let him go at 12 on a [10:54] trial basis [10:55] and um he started going to the beach [10:58] with him she has two brothers [10:59] that play that tournament ball and they [11:01] go all the time chance goes with them [11:04] and they always send me pictures of them [11:06] in the back seat laying down with her [11:08] and um [11:10] she she's the type of child that um [11:13] you love your children but no parent [11:15] needs to be wants to be [11:17] in that position with their child it's [11:19] heartbreaking [11:20] so um he's helped her keep from jumping [11:23] out of the car going down the road [11:24] drunk jumping out of her room um [11:28] she loves reptiles so we're hoping that [11:30] he's [11:31] she loves salamanders and she'll [11:33] actually uncover like a [11:35] war moccasin and so we're hoping that [11:37] chance [11:39] chance will keep her from doing that so [11:42] it's amazing [11:43] she leaves school she'll leave school on [11:44] her own so [11:46] um chance goes to school with her too [11:49] all the disney rides that he could with [11:51] her at disney and [11:52] um tiffany her mother said this is the [11:55] first time they've ever been to a [11:56] amusement park she didn't have a [11:58] meltdown and when i'm talking about [11:59] meltdowns with aubry i'm talking about [12:01] they have to call police the canine [12:04] squad in [12:05] to even contain her she's very strong [12:09] and medicated it has to be medicated but [12:12] the dogs always seem to calm her down [12:14] the canine dogs that they brought in [12:16] so that part's not just a cali but um [12:19] she needed her own dog so having the [12:22] service dog really impacted her life [12:24] which that's what service dogs do yeah [12:26] you know they [12:27] they change people's lives right better [12:30] often people ask me well what qualifies [12:32] as a service dog and really if you have [12:34] a disability of any kind and the service [12:38] dog [12:38] improves the quality of your life by [12:40] providing specific tasks that help with [12:42] your disability [12:44] then it's a service dog now you made me [12:46] think of another question that i want to [12:47] ask you and this is because this is a [12:48] common question [12:50] that i get with any sort of training i [12:52] know we were talking about this earlier [12:53] because there's really not [12:55] uh a black and white answer it is [12:59] the training time that it takes [13:01] depending on the service dog so [13:03] i'm sure it varies between what may be [13:05] the fastest you could train a dog to the [13:07] longest and [13:08] what causes those variations you know so [13:11] let's say some some of your dogs you can [13:13] have training out the door in [13:14] right a year and some take a year and a [13:16] half right why is that [13:18] what is the difference it depends on the [13:20] disability of the child [13:21] and you made me think of something [13:22] different by saying that it could depend [13:23] on the dog [13:24] because not all dogs learn the same at [13:26] the same rate i was actually thinking [13:28] both and you see them both right away [13:29] see i never thought about that too much [13:31] but mainly that [13:32] what i thought about was and know about [13:35] is the disability of the person getting [13:37] the dog [13:38] um do you ever have a set time frame [13:40] where you go the dog has to be done at [13:41] this point or do you train until mission [13:43] accomplished [13:44] training until mission accomplished [13:45] pretty much and usually it's never 24 [13:48] months [13:49] i think a max would probably be 18 [13:51] months now if you were training a cni [13:53] dog [13:53] right or something like that 24 plus [13:56] years would be very normal [13:57] right ptsd dogs very normal year right [14:01] you know because their tasks are not as [14:02] complicated right a lot of times [14:04] pts just the dog itself a good obedience [14:07] trained [14:08] dog depending on the disability again [14:10] but [14:11] sometimes it's the companionship and [14:14] maybe deep pressure therapy for when [14:16] they're in a crowd like at the va [14:18] um and how long do you continue to work [14:20] with the family after they have the [14:22] service dog [14:23] as long as they have the dog so [14:24] indefinitely and definitely yeah [14:26] i never go away i work with you they're [14:30] stuck with me just like [14:31] even my pet dogs and my dogs i've sung [14:34] i've [14:34] um sold to show homes and stuff they [14:36] never get rid of me [14:38] um i'm texting probably once a month [14:40] everybody that has one of my well good [14:42] thing you're a really nice guy [14:43] so it makes it easier yeah yeah i try [14:46] not to bug them or anything but i'll [14:47] just send them a text and say how's [14:49] everything going especially with the [14:50] service dogs [14:51] are there any problems because we also [14:53] will [14:54] go back and they're having an issue or [14:56] if the dog needs a refresher [14:58] on something we go back and do that and [15:00] all they have to do is call me a lot of [15:01] times [15:02] what's great about service dog homes [15:04] people also take the initiative [15:06] to do some self training with the dog [15:07] themselves we have a little boy that has [15:09] um [15:10] autism and he's epileptic and they're [15:12] doing now training with them i haven't [15:14] been involved [15:15] with waking the parents up when he's [15:17] about to have an epileptic [15:19] seizure and so a lot of people will take [15:23] the initiative to do some continued [15:24] training on their own and you and [15:26] speaking of doing training on their own [15:28] you and your team should start a youtube [15:29] channel [15:30] yeah start posting the training process [15:33] yeah [15:33] you know service dogs are very popular [15:35] on youtube right now because there are [15:37] so many people out there that want to [15:38] train their own service dog [15:40] and the more resources that they have [15:41] the better so not just [15:43] my channel i mean for example my [15:45] facebook group page that i have for my [15:47] youtube channel [15:48] i encourage people to post other [15:50] training videos other techniques [15:52] because i want people to have a huge [15:55] range of techniques to choose from so [15:57] they're able to choose a technique that [15:58] works best for that dog [16:00] and what are some of what what advice [16:02] could you give [16:03] all the people out there that are [16:05] training their own service dogs [16:07] as far as what you've seen with your son [16:09] training and the training that you've [16:10] done because [16:11] you're very modest you know a lot about [16:13] dog training even though you don't [16:15] say you're a dog trainer you know a lot [16:17] about it you've read a lot of dog [16:18] training books [16:19] and you see it every day dogs every [16:22] since i was [16:22] well my whole life i think i had like i [16:24] think i had a colleague actually when i [16:25] was [16:26] two my mom had yeah that might have been [16:28] the big influence bigger than [16:30] the lady across the street but um i [16:32] think the biggest thing [16:34] would probably be rather um whether [16:36] you're getting one from a pound [16:38] or a good breeder i mean it's very [16:40] important find a good breeder but [16:42] i'm not saying you can't find a good one [16:43] in a pound but you need to know [16:45] um to me i'm more for the breeder [16:49] as far as this goes a good breeder [16:51] because they should know the genetics [16:52] you can look at their dogs when you go [16:54] to get a dog from a pound you don't know [16:56] where he's coming from or what he's [16:58] experienced even though you're going [16:59] there's some good ones yeah you have to [17:01] spend a lot of time looking and to go [17:03] off of that the show that i had on [17:04] animal planet rescue dog to superdog [17:07] we trained 12 service dogs total [17:10] to find those 12 dogs that took us two [17:12] months checking [17:13] every shelter in la every day [17:16] well we went every single day i mean i [17:19] was going to these shelters so much that [17:21] i [17:21] knew dogs by name they recognized me it [17:24] was as if i worked at each one of these [17:25] shelters [17:26] in order to find the ones that were [17:28] perfect for what we needed them for [17:30] so it's doable but you really have to [17:32] take it i think the biggest thing [17:33] too is looking at the breed because we [17:36] all know that [17:37] labs and retrievers are great dogs for [17:39] service work [17:40] i didn't know this until i learned this [17:41] at tom rose school [17:43] um the poodles poodles are excellent i [17:45] had no i and um what was the other one [17:47] was a schnauzer depends on you know what [17:50] they're training them for [17:51] like a border collie could be a service [17:53] dog as well because they're so smart [17:55] but they're also you know so active that [17:58] i wouldn't recommend [17:59] a border collie to be a service dog for [18:01] somebody who [18:02] is in a wheelchair and is not really [18:05] that active [18:06] but maybe if i'm training a service dog [18:08] for a veteran that's suffering from [18:10] ptsd you know more active breed is going [18:12] to be suitable for him [18:14] because it could provide those services [18:15] that he needs simultaneously [18:17] right a young veteran that also that has [18:19] pvsc that [18:20] runs on the beach or whatever you may [18:22] want [18:23] um intrigue his mind things to do give [18:26] him things [18:26] yeah and sometimes people will look at a [18:29] veteran that has a service dog and think [18:31] what do you [18:31] what does that person need a service dog [18:33] for yeah you know just because you can't [18:35] visually see exact disability doesn't [18:38] mean that they're not [18:39] really struggling kind of like this guy [18:41] besides the tattoos [18:43] and looking at him big smile on his face [18:45] you would never know he's suffering with [18:47] such severe depression that he would um [18:50] try to take his own wife [18:52] so he has the dog like and the dog helps [18:53] with this dog like this [18:55] yeah oh i like that name too guys yes [18:58] so yeah you need to you need to look [19:00] number one look at the breed [19:02] if i'd be very cautious about um a [19:04] shelter [19:05] um it's doable but really take your time [19:07] do it will take your time [19:09] you need to find not just a purebred dog [19:11] but [19:12] a purebred dog bred by a reputable [19:14] breeder that means he does [19:16] dna testing i mean that's very [19:18] everybody's learning about dna tests [19:20] i have a lot of old collie breeders call [19:22] me because they don't understand i'm [19:24] like look [19:25] now that people know about dna testing [19:27] which years before we had the markers [19:29] we had no way of doing this now that we [19:31] do a responsible [19:32] reader is going to test their puppies [19:34] and the customer's not stupid anymore [19:36] you got youtube you guys yep [19:38] the internet they say oh what does pra [19:41] mean [19:42] you know what general public is what is [19:44] this ca so they're gonna call you in [19:46] question so you need to educate yourself [19:47] and if you're gonna be selling a puppy [19:49] because a good a good puppy [19:52] just a pet puppy i'm only speaking of a [19:54] collie [19:55] other breeds will be more it's 15 more [19:57] or less depending on [19:58] yeah they say average 1500 for a pet [20:01] puppy [20:02] um so if you're paying that kind of [20:05] money [20:06] you don't want one that's going to die [20:07] in a year or go blind [20:09] especially when you're buying a puppy [20:11] for your um [20:13] kids yeah and when they're going to have [20:14] a job a responsibility i mean it's the [20:16] same thing with [20:17] the police departments and the military [20:20] when they're getting their dogs they're [20:21] trying to find [20:23] the best breeder and they have breeders [20:24] that they work with on a regular basis [20:26] right i could be wrong but i'm pretty [20:28] sure the military gets a lot of their [20:30] dogs from [20:31] a buddy of mine who has a kennel called [20:32] logan haas yeah and he breeds a lot of [20:34] the dogs for [20:36] military and they do very strict [20:38] specific tests [20:39] tests to make sure the dogs can do right [20:42] what they need them to do [20:44] you know that's where the melon will [20:45] come become so popular too because they [20:47] can do more than a [20:48] shepherd they're lighter jumping out of [20:49] the planes and they tend to have less [20:51] health issues because they haven't been [20:53] as overbred and that's what's so scary [20:56] though about what's happening with them [20:57] now at the [20:58] shelters because of you know i really [21:00] blame the movie john wick three super [21:02] entertaining movie [21:03] but you see these two melanois in the [21:05] movie right and what i found out that [21:07] some of these people were doing to try [21:08] to make money they would tell people [21:09] like oh yeah these are the puppies from [21:11] john wick three [21:12] wow and they'll be able to do everything [21:13] those who will be able to do yeah that's [21:15] what people believe [21:16] and they could with the training yeah [21:18] right but even these [21:19] people weren't doing the right steps [21:20] that you're talking about to make sure [21:22] that they're [21:23] doing everything they can do yeah to do [21:26] it correctly [21:26] so now they have their puppy right right [21:28] and they're doing the training not those [21:30] i'm talking about the words that they [21:31] get for the service dog work right [21:33] what is some of the first stuff you guys [21:34] like to do with your puppies [21:36] after the first eight weeks what is the [21:39] first step that you like to do so that [21:40] they can replicate it people that are [21:42] watching or advice that you have for [21:44] them i think the first thing for any [21:46] service dog you want to do [21:47] is obedience basic obedience because [21:50] you want a service dog you can take out [21:52] in public they're not going to be [21:53] jumping up on people you can go out to [21:54] eat [21:55] and teach them to talk tuck under the [21:57] table [21:58] when you have a service dog in public [21:59] you shouldn't should not even know he's [22:01] there [22:02] if you're sitting beside the table um [22:04] you shouldn't even know the dog [22:05] exists the dogs that you know that [22:07] aren't real service dogs and that's a [22:08] big problem now [22:10] people taking their dogs and kroger and [22:12] put them in the buggy that's not a [22:13] service dog [22:14] a dog's not supposed to sit on the bench [22:16] with you while you're eating he's [22:18] supposed to be under the table [22:20] um there's a whole lot of things that we [22:22] have an ada but [22:24] um they're to protect the person that [22:27] owns the dog really [22:28] yeah and it's tough to really yeah it's [22:31] tough to distinguish [22:32] you can't really you're really not [22:34] supposed to you can only ask two [22:36] questions of [22:36] somebody that has a service dog is a [22:38] service dog and what tasks do they [22:40] perform for you i'm glad you brought [22:41] that up though because there are a lot [22:42] of people out there that are [22:44] still in the middle of training their [22:46] dog [22:47] to be a service dog so what i've noticed [22:49] a lot of people do is they just put a [22:51] service dog vest [22:52] on and they take the dog out and claim [22:54] that it's a service dog even though it's [22:55] still [22:56] a service dog in training and what i [22:58] tell people is if you're training a [22:59] service dog [23:00] and you yourself do not need a service [23:02] dog put the in training vest on most [23:05] people are still going to leave you [23:06] alone anyways [23:07] but also make it obvious that you're [23:09] training yeah [23:10] not that you're just trying to take your [23:11] dog with you like when i'm training a [23:13] service dog there is no question [23:15] whether or not i'm training it's very [23:17] obvious i'm training i have 100 [23:19] focus on the dog because i'm teaching [23:21] the dog how they need to act in public [23:23] i'm not out there for myself i'm not out [23:25] there going to get a cheeseburger or [23:26] going you know it's like i'm taking the [23:28] dog to work them [23:29] and it's really clear yeah so then if [23:32] someone comes up and says is that your [23:33] service dog i say no it's a service dog [23:35] in training [23:36] yeah nine out of 10 times no more like [23:38] 19 out of 20 times yeah [23:40] they're going to say okay that's fine [23:42] keep training right every now and then [23:43] you might run into a business [23:45] or a location where they say sorry the [23:46] dog can't be in here it's not a service [23:48] dog and you say okay no problem right [23:50] and you walk out right but there are [23:52] you're correct a lot of people that are [23:53] taking advantage of the system [23:55] right there are risks though because if [23:57] you are claiming that a dog is a service [23:58] dog and it's actually not you can get up [24:00] to a year in prison and a thousand [24:02] dollar fine [24:02] well i didn't really know that yeah [24:04] that's cool to look [24:06] that is cool they need to and i've been [24:08] in my semi in my not my seminars but my [24:10] presentations i'm always talking about [24:12] that and [24:13] i'm always saying they have to do [24:16] something about this [24:17] they have to do something about it so [24:19] i'm glad to hear that the rules are out [24:20] there now [24:21] that's how much of it is actually being [24:22] enforced at least it's something that [24:24] can be enforced [24:25] absolutely yeah because if you don't [24:26] need a service dog [24:28] just take there's plenty places you can [24:29] take your pet dog because you're ruining [24:31] it for people [24:32] that really do need service dogs go to [24:34] an outside eatery or something if you [24:35] want your dog with you to eat [24:36] yeah you know that's where i train my [24:38] servant talk about train my service dogs [24:40] at the outside eatery [24:41] before they're really good and trained [24:43] just to get them used to it [24:45] yeah teaching them tuck under the table [24:47] and other dogs not paying other dogs any [24:49] attention [24:50] so you can pretty much spot a real [24:52] service dog i think oh yeah [24:54] i agree or one in training or one in [24:56] training you know but like i said if you [24:58] are training it make sure you're [24:59] training it right [25:00] make sure you're training you know your [25:01] focus has to be on that dog [25:03] the whole time i'm working with a puppy [25:05] that i'm doing service dog training for [25:06] if i'm talking to somebody else i'm [25:08] doing this because i'm watching the dog [25:09] the whole time [25:10] yeah because we know we have that one [25:12] second window when they do something in [25:13] order to let them know that's good or [25:15] that's not good [25:16] and to show them what they need to do to [25:17] be correct in that right [25:19] in that situation makes a big difference [25:21] yep constantly building up that [25:22] confidence and that exposure and [25:24] i had the benefit to watch grant trained [25:26] pet dogs and when you're training pet [25:28] dogs you have [25:30] all kinds of dogs you have all kinds of [25:32] personalities [25:34] a lot of quirks sometimes because you [25:36] can buy a purebred dog and just throw [25:37] them out in your backyard [25:39] and you might as well have went to the [25:41] pound i mean [25:43] he's going to be neurotic in a lot of [25:45] cases just kind of crazy [25:47] so he's i've been proud of him because [25:49] he's seems like he has caught some [25:50] really [25:51] he it's his first year or so and um [25:54] training he has really caught some of [25:55] the [25:56] but he's done well and so what i love [25:58] about [25:59] is he's learning to different all dogs [26:02] aren't the same [26:02] so he has to think a little bit okay [26:04] this dog's not doing it like the last [26:06] one did [26:07] what does this dog like different things [26:09] motivate different dogs like i've seen [26:10] in some of your videos [26:12] toys or some um food can be for almost [26:15] all of them if you get them [26:17] ready for food yeah pretty much every [26:20] dog [26:21] baby um every dog's food motivated it's [26:23] just a matter of how [26:24] much motivation do they have and right [26:27] you know often the food motivation [26:29] is lowered by either over free [26:32] overfeeding or free feeding [26:34] you know if why is a dog gonna want to [26:36] work for something if they can get it at [26:37] any point in time right you know when [26:39] they know and that's why i do like the [26:41] whole [26:41] imprinting a dog on making them work for [26:44] it because it does build that food drive [26:45] and we all know that [26:46] reward based training is limited to how [26:49] much the dog wants the reward that's [26:50] being offered [26:51] i think one of your couple of your [26:53] videos i've watched about service dogs [26:55] um [26:55] which are really good harley harley the [26:58] service dog [26:59] um i think there's some of the things [27:01] you do need to start with of course [27:03] um the engagement i mean i was watching [27:06] spock in here a while ago [27:07] he's very engaged with rachel and so i [27:10] think that's the first step [27:12] to um if you're talking about training [27:14] not so much as the environmental [27:16] is the engagement it's so important [27:17] luring and [27:19] communication communication letting them [27:21] know that you love them you know [27:23] they they just want to be want to please [27:25] you so [27:26] i think it's more of the relationship [27:28] between you and the dog [27:30] um and maybe not be so tough but [27:33] because and understand they're going to [27:35] get it if you're doing the right methods [27:37] they'll eventually get it you just may [27:38] have to take longer with [27:40] that dog um yeah i'm glad you said that [27:42] too taking longer with a specific dog [27:44] right something i tell people and you [27:46] know we talked about this [27:47] not too long ago not having a set date [27:50] on when you want something to be done in [27:52] fact i got an email today right [27:54] the person said oh how what should my [27:56] expectations be how much should my dog [27:58] know in two weeks or how much did my dog [28:00] know in three weeks [28:01] that's impossible for me to answer first [28:03] of all i don't know the dog that you're [28:04] working with i don't know how [28:05] intelligent the dog is how motivated the [28:07] dog is how much [28:08] perseverance that dog has what are those [28:11] that dog's entrance i don't know these [28:12] things [28:13] and i don't know how good of a trainer [28:15] you are right i don't know how good your [28:16] timing is you don't know how good [28:18] your reward delivery all these things so [28:21] a dog that [28:21] may take someone like michael ellis [28:24] right two weeks to train [28:25] right it might take somebody else two [28:27] months to try right you know [28:29] that can all go with their experience [28:31] too and that's why i don't have a goal [28:33] like i want this to be done at this [28:34] point [28:35] have fun with your dogs right just train [28:37] them and work with them every day [28:38] and they'll get it they'll get as long [28:40] as they know they it's long you [28:42] have to be firm i always tell my son [28:45] training dogs is just like raising kids [28:47] one of the biggest things you have to do [28:49] is be consistent if you're not [28:51] consistent with them [28:52] they don't really know what to expect [28:53] out of you oh my dad lets me lay on the [28:55] couch [28:56] today and then he don't tomorrow so it's [28:59] kind of like [28:59] they have a mixed signal right so you [29:01] have to be consistent with them [29:03] i like that you said mixed signal too [29:04] because i think we were talking about [29:05] this earlier as well [29:06] just basic common mistakes that people [29:09] make [29:10] for example someone's calling the dog to [29:12] come to them right [29:13] the dog looks at them because they're [29:14] making noise and the dog doesn't [29:15] instantly come and the person's right [29:17] get over here [29:18] right and then the dog goes oh i do not [29:20] want to come to you [29:21] right why am i going to want to come to [29:22] you if you're yelling at me yeah exactly [29:24] yelling can be the worst thing and [29:26] uh i saw someone doing that the other [29:27] day and i said once your dog looks at [29:29] you start praising them because your dog [29:31] is thinking about whatever they're [29:32] looking at [29:32] right so your dog turns and looks at you [29:34] and then you're still what they appear [29:36] to be reprimanding them they're not [29:37] going to want to come to you [29:38] no the moment they look you'd be like [29:40] yeah goodbye like kind of like i think [29:42] it might have been in [29:43] your interview might have been with [29:45] bethany um [29:47] about going to which we don't we know we [29:49] don't like dog parks [29:50] stay away from dog parks there's too [29:52] many problems and issues you can take [29:54] them somewhere else [29:55] you can like socialize your dog [29:56] somewhere else besides the dog park i [29:57] like dog beaches because they're more [29:59] open peaches are great [30:00] but yeah the dog park it's just i'm [30:02] always worried about [30:04] you know is somebody else's dad the [30:06] first dog ever took to a dog park [30:09] got pneumonia really he did because they [30:11] had like a little pool for him to swim [30:12] in [30:13] he got in there the next day he was sick [30:14] i took him to the vet he had pneumonia [30:16] or getting attacked [30:17] attacked yeah but you know if you have a [30:18] puppy that let's say it's 15 weeks of [30:20] age it's still within the [30:22] imprinting period you take it to the dog [30:24] park and it's first time [30:26] interacting with dogs two of them attack [30:28] them right or three [30:29] you know before i knew about how [30:31] dangerous dog parks could be [30:32] right before i was a dog trainer i would [30:34] take my dogs all the time and i had my [30:36] dog at one of the local dog parks out [30:38] here and she was attacked by three dogs [30:40] and the person who had three dogs [30:42] brought all three dogs there which they [30:44] advised against too because [30:46] once you do that now you're creating [30:47] this pack mentality and those three dogs [30:49] rushed mine and then from that point on [30:51] that dog was always uncomfortable around [30:54] other dogs yeah [30:55] you know and had i not gone to the dog [30:56] park wouldn't it happen i wouldn't have [30:58] that issue and i think it's wonderful to [30:59] train your dogs in different locations [31:01] um grant started when he got back from [31:03] michael ellis [31:04] training with a guy in atlanta that does [31:07] police dogs protection [31:09] and every week we went we probably went [31:11] i went up there with him [31:12] longer than i did i went probably four [31:13] times we were always at a different [31:15] location [31:16] now he had to of course get permission [31:18] if it's if you need to um [31:20] but there's all kinds of parks state [31:22] parks schools [31:23] we went to um a church that had a big [31:27] just great place they did a lot they [31:28] were doing a lot of tracking and stuff [31:30] um scent detection and stuff so i think [31:33] it's great to train them dogs [31:35] not just you don't want to just train [31:36] them in your own backyard [31:38] um petsmart um tractor supply we go to [31:42] track supply is a great place a lot of [31:44] those get up [31:45] grant had a few comments because he let [31:47] one of his dogs get up on something but [31:50] you know we don't worry about that but [31:52] was he doing a climb command yeah [31:54] he lets him jump on it's not only just [31:56] the height but it's also the noise they [31:58] make [31:58] like he'll jump maybe jump on a metal [32:00] drum or [32:01] climb up on a big old thing of dog food [32:03] i think the comment he got was he [32:06] one of them jumped up on a dog bed and [32:08] somebody didn't oh really [32:09] but you know you're always going to have [32:10] the trolls but that's a big part of [32:13] what you're saying is getting the dog [32:15] generalized right to the training as far [32:17] as and you can start that as young as [32:19] you [32:20] um you know you can it's best maybe to [32:23] wait until after they've had the [32:25] last shot but i feel pretty comfortable [32:27] after the maybe the second shot [32:28] yeah and what i do with that people have [32:30] asked me about this quite a bit because [32:32] veterinarians will say [32:33] don't take your dog out in public until [32:35] they've received all their vaccinations [32:37] and that's it makes sense coming from [32:39] the perspective of a veterinarian their [32:41] responsibility [32:42] is to keep your dog healthy right and [32:43] then you look at a dog trainer's [32:44] perspective their [32:46] responsibility is to make sure you have [32:47] a well-balanced well-trained [32:48] well-socialized dog [32:50] so you have to look at it from both [32:51] perspectives and of course if you are [32:53] taking your dog out before they've had [32:54] all their vaccinations there is a risk [32:56] right [32:56] and the risk is going to vary depending [32:58] on where you take them so for example [33:00] if i'm working with a puppy especially [33:02] one that's going to be a service dog [33:03] i am taking them out right but i'm not [33:05] taking them to places that are high risk [33:07] i'm [33:07] not taking them to the park [33:11] if you live you know let's say you live [33:13] in new york i'm not going to be taking [33:14] the dog walking around the street there [33:16] because there's way more traffic [33:18] if you live out in the country and you [33:19] don't have that many people walking by [33:20] with their dogs [33:22] more likely than not they're all already [33:23] vaccinated and they're not going to be a [33:25] risk so you just have to be smart about [33:26] where we're taking them [33:27] and make sure you get their vaccinations [33:29] yes a lot of dogs that get parvo have [33:31] never been vaccinated [33:32] or they have been vaccinated and they [33:34] had a faulty vaccination well what [33:35] happens with that [33:36] when you get a when you give a puppy a [33:38] shot at six weeks old [33:40] they already have immunity from their [33:41] mother from they get from the [33:42] cholesterol from the first milk [33:44] she has so sometimes that um [33:47] overrides the shot no interest actually [33:49] overrides the shot so you may think [33:51] they're protected [33:52] from the first shot but they may not get [33:54] protected until like [33:56] maybe the second or third shot oh okay [33:58] the fourth shot is really the [33:59] after 16 weeks is the best route the [34:01] safest route to take [34:03] but safest safest but that don't mean [34:05] you can't do it [34:07] responsibly yeah and that's what i [34:09] always try to responsibly [34:10] educate people on because for me the [34:12] socializing is so important [34:13] i have an article on it and it's also in [34:15] my manual where i go over the whole [34:17] section of how i like to socialize a dog [34:19] but what that section really is about [34:21] is more about getting the dog [34:23] generalized to the training [34:24] which is important to point out to [34:26] people that do train their dogs [34:28] in their home if they only train in the [34:30] living room [34:31] and then they take their dog and try to [34:32] do obedience [34:34] at the local park or at the local home [34:37] depot [34:37] the dog is not going to perform the same [34:39] they're not they're not [34:40] they have to get them generalized so [34:42] what exactly is the concept of getting [34:44] brandt tries to get his clients to when [34:46] he's training them um he does like a [34:49] um board and train and so they have i [34:52] think they have four lessons with them [34:53] too [34:53] so he tries to get them not at our house [34:56] at our [34:57] facility but out in different places [34:59] with them so they can work learn to work [35:01] in different environments the dog and [35:03] them and the people [35:04] so now grant has his own dog training [35:06] business and then he does the dog [35:08] training for your [35:09] non-profit training service dog as soon [35:11] as he come from um [35:12] michael ellis i hired him what is his [35:15] dog training business [35:16] name don't take your dog for granted [35:18] don't take your dog for granted so [35:19] that's the website don't take it [35:20] off for granted.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 167/841,com i'm gonna put that [35:22] in the description because people who [35:24] are [35:25] in your area south carolina where [35:27] exactly georgia [35:28] georgia and south carolina he actually [35:30] gets most of his clients from augusta [35:32] georgia where we live right on the river [35:33] which is in between where we live in [35:35] augusta [35:36] so he gets a lot of his clients from [35:37] augusta because i always have a lot of [35:39] people asking me [35:40] different places in the country like hey [35:42] do you know a trainer in this area do [35:43] you know a trainer [35:44] yeah i trust tom rose graduates [35:47] right and he's a tom rose graduate and i [35:49] trust students of michael ellis [35:51] right you know and he has both of them [35:52] right we have the same experience [35:54] i highly recommend him to anybody that's [35:57] in that area [35:58] if they want a well-trained dog if they [36:00] want somebody that knows dog training [36:01] knows the science and knows [36:03] i know a lot of them that um what in [36:05] fact i saw that you were a friend of [36:06] abigail [36:08] and i said they know each other you know [36:09] i told her i said they know each other [36:10] he said we all kind of know each other [36:12] yeah tom rose people you know it's a [36:15] very small [36:15] yeah and what's so great about it is and [36:18] i've watched it with craft [36:19] seems like i related everything back to [36:20] grant but in the training um [36:23] it's like they can bounce things off [36:25] each other even [36:26] um some of the people that michael ellis [36:29] you know he's having a specific problem [36:31] with one of his dogs training [36:33] he don't quite know what to do he can [36:35] call one of them and they've had that [36:36] experience [36:37] so they say try this and he does the [36:38] same thing for them so [36:40] it's it's a network that is really [36:42] beneficial to everybody [36:44] yeah so um and he's got you know he's [36:46] got experience with um [36:48] michael and with tom rose and dave and [36:50] jeremy and them so um [36:52] and they all follow the same science [36:55] they do you know and it's the same thing [36:56] that [36:57] i mentioned to everybody who asks me [36:59] questions about what do you think about [37:01] this type of people what do you think [37:02] about that [37:03] for me it's like look at the technique [37:05] and ask yourself [37:06] does it apply the science right and if [37:08] you study [37:09] how i train or if you study how michael [37:11] ellis training or tom rose [37:13] and we were talking about that earlier [37:14] with tom rose's book tom rose's book is [37:16] eight i believe it's 18 years old now [37:19] and so some of the techniques or some of [37:21] the ways that he has changed [37:23] he trains has changed a little bit yeah [37:25] in the 18 years since he wrote the book [37:27] but the book applies the size it does [37:30] and that's what's the most important [37:31] thing and then you get to pick and [37:32] choose [37:33] i like this that michael ellis does i [37:35] like this that [37:36] tom rose does i like what forrest mickey [37:38] does over here i like what bart bellen [37:40] does over here i like what [37:41] uh uh carl carol carl [37:44] what's her name carol bridget or [37:47] something like that [37:48] i'm messing up her name but you take [37:49] something you know and then you come up [37:51] with your own [37:52] kind of style but as long as you're [37:54] applying that science [37:56] right you know and that's kind of like [37:58] what i did with the leash pressure we [37:59] were talking about earlier [38:01] i knew that if you turn the leash [38:02] pressure on and you waited for the dog [38:04] to comply that [38:05] you could teach leash pressure but then [38:06] i thought well what if i use something [38:08] the dog already knows would it be easier [38:10] and more effective [38:12] and sure enough it was right and that's [38:13] when it really gets cool when you start [38:15] learning so much you can start coming up [38:16] with your own kind of idea [38:18] that is and what really and i've seen [38:19] different trainers with granted at the [38:21] two schools [38:22] and i did notice you always notice [38:24] something new from somebody else [38:25] and one of them that you do in one of [38:26] yours is when you have the leash and you [38:28] put your when you're trying to get them [38:29] into the down [38:30] yeah and you put your and they go right [38:32] on now you know [38:33] you can learn their little picks up you [38:35] can say okay i like what nate does how [38:37] he does this down [38:38] yeah i like how michael does this sit or [38:41] whatever it is [38:42] but you know and you can combine that's [38:43] when it all comes that's when it's you i [38:46] guess [38:46] you know because then there's no trainer [38:48] really like you you've got pieces of [38:50] everybody else [38:51] yeah and then your own demeanor and um [38:53] the way you not everybody can relate to [38:55] a dog [38:56] um they might should be the ones maybe [38:58] not training the whole thing with the [39:00] foot using my foot on the leash i was a [39:02] little hesitant [39:03] about posting that as well because i was [39:05] trying to think of somebody's [39:06] perspective that doesn't know or [39:08] understand dog training [39:09] and then they're just thinking oh well [39:10] you're just using force you're just [39:12] stepping on the leash [39:13] it's like no if you look at you're not [39:15] putting much pressure at all [39:16] not much pressure at all and then the [39:17] big thing is so i saw a video by another [39:20] trainer in fact somebody sent me the [39:22] link [39:22] and they went oh this this trainer is [39:24] basically [39:25] talking smack about you without saying [39:27] your name specifically [39:29] i don't think he was i think i don't i'm [39:31] not the only trainer that will use a [39:32] leash and step on it [39:34] but he's the person in the video says oh [39:36] yeah there's trainers out there that'll [39:37] just step [39:38] on the leash and make the dog do it and [39:39] that's superficial and the dogs don't [39:41] learn [39:42] it's like no that's no different than [39:44] luring the dog [39:45] right it's another cube because the dog [39:47] knows that the lure [39:48] predicts food no different than the [39:50] leash predicts food [39:52] they both predict rewards therefore to [39:54] the dog if taught correctly they [39:56] both give the dog the same feeling of [39:58] enjoyment and training [39:59] as the lord does when done correctly and [40:02] then as long as you say the command [40:03] before you do the cue the dog learns the [40:05] command and that just simply becomes [40:08] a means to an end and what's the end the [40:10] dog doing it on the verbal command [40:11] or whatever and that goes back to time [40:13] and being so important too [40:15] you know that's very important the [40:17] timing yeah the timing you were talking [40:18] about the other day too [40:19] kind of like you know that's why markers [40:22] are so important [40:22] right and you were doing the clicker [40:24] training i can see where the clicker is [40:26] good um because [40:27] we've done well where we did [40:30] clicker training was with um petsmart [40:32] you know a little [40:33] petsmart thing but i mean we hadn't done [40:35] it since then but when you started it [40:37] you started talking about it the other [40:38] day [40:38] and i started listening to your [40:39] reasoning it makes a lot it's always the [40:41] same sound [40:42] yes because our yes our yeses can be [40:44] different it can change [40:45] yeah it can depend on really how we feel [40:47] that day we may not feel good [40:49] might have a headache you know we might [40:50] want to be getting done with it right [40:52] there we have something else [40:53] we got to do so you you know a lot of [40:55] things can change that and you know [40:56] what's funny is i haven't really [40:58] used a clicker in years because i've [41:00] been using my voice [41:02] right and i've had a handful of people [41:03] they wanted to see how i would train if [41:05] i were to train with a clicker yeah [41:07] and to be honest i actually really [41:09] enjoyed using the clicker [41:11] with jet because it is so effective now [41:13] of course just like anything you have to [41:15] make sure you're using it correctly [41:17] which makes me think of something [41:18] because you will see a lot of people [41:20] using clickers and if they don't fully [41:21] understand how clicker works [41:22] right they're not going to be doing it [41:24] correctly and a perfect example of it is [41:26] in [41:26] in the movie jurassic world yeah so [41:29] jurassic world where [41:31] what's that actor's name i forget the [41:33] one that's working with the raptors [41:35] yeah which i always like to say a [41:36] malinois as a raptor you know a lot of [41:38] alan watt trainers call them raptors [41:40] right but if you remember so [41:43] those of you watching pull up jurassic [41:45] world and pull up the part where he's [41:46] training the raptors where he's [41:48] on the overhead balcony or over the [41:50] balcony looking down on him right [41:51] he's taking the clicker and he's just [41:52] going click click click click click [41:53] click okay [41:54] click click click click click click yeah [41:56] the clicks meant absolutely [41:58] nothing it was just and i've seen just [42:00] like when you're saying sit sit [42:02] sit sit sit yeah you're they you know [42:04] exactly he wasn't using it [42:06] the correct way right you know and it's [42:08] not [42:09] this is another misconception people [42:11] think that okay if i use a clicker [42:13] click and i reward click reward if i [42:15] want to give the dog a big reward then i [42:17] go click [42:18] click for one thing no that actually [42:20] just creates more confusion than [42:22] anything [42:22] if you want to increase the value of the [42:24] click increase the value of the reward [42:26] that the click predicts [42:27] right so it's still one click and then [42:29] you can make the reward a little bit [42:30] bigger which would make the click [42:31] then more valuable right to the animal [42:34] that you're training because that's [42:35] all part of that opera conditioning and [42:37] operate conditioning is what we apply to [42:39] any [42:40] right animal we're training whether we [42:42] realize it or not [42:43] yeah even ourselves even humans yeah [42:46] it's all operating always getting what [42:48] you want you know the way to get what [42:50] you want [42:50] that's true i think one of the biggest [42:52] things too from my own experience of [42:55] learning [42:56] in my little bit older age here um is be [42:59] open-minded to new things [43:00] because i was trained with the choke [43:03] collar [43:04] and i can think back when i was training [43:06] my dogs when i was showing them and [43:08] stuff and getting them [43:08] even just leash break it's as simple as [43:10] leash breaking you know we were taught [43:12] to pull [43:12] down pull them towards the ground do it [43:15] about three times [43:16] well that's nothing but that's a [43:18] horrible way to do it [43:19] when i watched the new ways you ended up [43:21] getting bit on your ankle [43:23] oh yeah you didn't get bit on your ankle [43:25] because the dog didn't like it [43:26] you're not building a good relationship [43:28] with the dog you're hurting the dog [43:30] yeah and it's probably harmful to the [43:32] dog so [43:33] um i think you have to be open to new [43:34] things just because you're [43:36] um older or you did certain things a [43:39] certain way [43:40] you need your service dog is that you [43:42] train now do you use [43:44] positive punishment yeah yeah when do [43:46] you use that in the training because [43:48] there are people out there that will say [43:50] you should never use positive punishment [43:53] it should and [43:54] for those watching just a refresher [43:56] positive punishment is [43:57] anything added to the equation to stop a [43:59] behavior so [44:00] yelling at a dog it's not a preferred [44:02] technique but that is an example of [44:04] positive punishment [44:05] a leash pop on a training collar is [44:07] positive punishment [44:08] squirting your dog with a squirt gun if [44:10] you do that to stop them from barking [44:12] some people will [44:13] that's another form of positive [44:14] punishment anything we're adding to the [44:16] equation [44:17] there are a lot of people out there that [44:18] say you should never use positive [44:20] punishment on a dog [44:22] which i disagree with right but i also [44:25] disagree with starting day one using [44:28] positive punishment because i don't [44:29] think it's fair for [44:31] somebody or a dog right to be corrected [44:34] without [44:34] ever knowing what they're being [44:36] corrected for that's some of that [44:38] traditional [44:39] yeah dog training techniques they start [44:41] with corrections i think as long as it [44:42] kind of is [44:43] as long as it works and it don't hurt [44:44] the dog it's conducive to the training [44:46] it's conducive to the training so i [44:48] think um [44:49] when would you start implementing that [44:51] are there certain situations you might [44:52] use a correction on earlier in the [44:54] training [44:55] and then times where you wait till later [44:57] like i'll give an example dogs that i [44:59] train i will correct them day one [45:01] if they're trying to chase a car yeah if [45:03] they're different if they're something [45:04] that's going to hurt them right [45:05] especially and that brings up another [45:07] subject the e-collar [45:08] and i had i mean i can speak on these [45:11] things because i felt a certain way [45:12] and i've changed my mindset since grant [45:14] went to tom rose and michael ellis and [45:16] not seeing him use it and i've seen that [45:18] they really do not hurt the dog if [45:20] they're [45:20] used appropriately and you're trained [45:22] you need to be trained on them well [45:23] michael ellis is [45:25] i mean he is so good at explaining [45:27] things yeah because people ask me about [45:29] remote collar training and i don't have [45:30] any online training [45:32] for that but i do use remote collars i [45:34] think the callers before maybe [45:36] gave them a bad reputation maybe and [45:38] even the word shock collar sounds [45:40] i'm electrocuted yeah yeah that's the [45:43] e-collar or other names for [45:44] remote training college remote collar [45:46] because um i mean i was opposed to it to [45:49] it first until [45:50] although i was too we have to be [45:52] open-minded [45:53] and realize just because we don't aren't [45:55] educated on something [45:57] doesn't make that wrong we don't know [45:59] anything about it [46:00] so well it's application application for [46:03] example a tool that i don't like [46:05] is the general eater i'm not a fan of it [46:07] i don't like to use it [46:09] but if it's used correctly it is fine [46:11] it's okay it's safe [46:12] now with the gentle leader for those [46:14] watching that may not know what it is [46:15] it's the strap that goes around the [46:16] dog's muzzle it hooks underneath [46:18] and it gives you the ability to control [46:20] the dog's head and you can close [46:21] the dog's mouth i think it was also the [46:23] intent to keep them from pulling [46:25] pulling away because if they start to [46:26] pull they get the pressure this way [46:28] i've used it before too yeah i don't i [46:30] like the new what new ways we do things [46:32] a lot [46:33] right i mean i've had clients that use [46:35] the gentle leader like i had this one [46:36] client she was an older woman she was [46:38] around 80 years old [46:40] and she used it and it worked great for [46:41] her because her dog would walk right [46:43] until the dog felt it [46:44] like you said certain applications yeah [46:46] and the dog wouldn't pull and she wasn't [46:47] pulling [46:48] on it it prevented the dog from pulling [46:50] and it worked for her right and it [46:51] worked for that dog [46:52] great it's fine just because i don't [46:54] like it doesn't mean that i'm gonna say [46:56] don't ever use it [46:57] yeah now i do say used incorrectly it [46:59] could it could be [47:01] bad for the dog right just like a shock [47:03] collar if you use a shock collar [47:04] incorrectly you could traumatize the dog [47:06] you can create fear issues [47:07] you can create a lot of problems so what [47:09] i always tell people if you're [47:10] interested in using a remote collar [47:12] go on leerberg online university find [47:15] michael ellis [47:16] and download his course and i was [47:18] recommending that to people without even [47:19] personally going through the course [47:21] myself because i trust michael ellis [47:23] yeah as a trainer i have the highest [47:25] respect right [47:26] he has a great reputation i mean not [47:28] only is he good we were talking about [47:30] this earlier not only is he [47:31] incredibly good at training dogs but [47:33] he's so [47:34] well spoken and so articulated you said [47:36] earlier like the man's so smart [47:38] he could have been a rocket scientist if [47:40] he wanted to but but he chose to pursue [47:42] their career [47:43] and lucky for all of us because we get [47:44] to benefit from what he's given us in [47:47] the dog training community [47:48] but i was recommending it to people and [47:50] i said you know what i should check it [47:51] out [47:52] just so i know exactly what i'm [47:54] recommending right and of course [47:55] i wasn't wrong the course is phenomenal [47:58] right it's incredible i mean the first [48:00] 15 minutes of it i learned like three [48:02] new things that i've since added to my [48:04] repertoire of [48:05] techniques so even for a skill trainer [48:07] that already knows remote color tree [48:09] it's worth watching that but point being [48:11] if it's done correctly it's a great [48:13] tool same thing with the prong collar [48:15] you know i was [48:17] you know grant told me because i think [48:18] chance was [48:20] i actually started training thinking i [48:22] was gonna train chance before grant got [48:24] home from [48:25] um tom rose and he said just wait let me [48:27] do it [48:28] just wait let me do it because i was [48:30] using i was seeing some of the things he [48:31] was using [48:32] and thinking i should go when i've never [48:34] been trained on it so you need to be [48:35] true to me you need to be trained on the [48:37] e-collar [48:37] you need to be trained on the prong [48:39] caller as well you know what's great [48:41] too is people are becoming way more [48:43] open-minded as we were saying earlier [48:45] the general public has become way more [48:47] educated on not [48:48] just dog training but they're more [48:50] educated on the tools they're even more [48:52] educated on nutrition right you can even [48:54] see [48:54] a lot of these dog food companies are [48:56] even starting to cater to that [48:57] saying you know like look at our first [48:59] ingredient is chicken first ingredient [49:02] is beef [49:02] right yeah right instead of corn [49:06] red all the red things you can oh yeah [49:08] colorings [49:09] color color red one blue too yeah yeah [49:12] so the general public and their dog food [49:13] looks like color [49:14] even when they poop i was really nervous [49:17] too about saying anything on my channel [49:18] at all about remote training collars [49:20] yeah but to my surprise people have been [49:23] very open-minded [49:24] yeah i've posted some of the videos [49:26] where i discuss it and people have [49:27] reached out and they said i was so [49:28] curious about remote collars i didn't [49:30] know if they were good or bad but [49:31] now based on hearing you discuss it a [49:33] little bit yeah i'm doing more research [49:34] i think if you planning on doing an off [49:36] leash and a lot of people [49:37] want off leash then i think you're going [49:39] to need the collar that's the only way i [49:41] mean just like you were talking about [49:42] the dog running out of the road [49:43] getting hit i mean you want to you want [49:45] a good correction on that [49:47] yeah you need to be like i'm not going [49:49] to forget what i just got for [49:50] heading heading to that road i'd rather [49:52] correct my dog once than have him get [49:54] hit by a car right [49:55] and even when i tell people with my own [49:57] collar is we're with my dogs rather [49:59] the funny thing is if i do go to a [50:00] lesson and i'm taking my training collar [50:02] with [50:03] in case the client wants to use it or [50:04] they're interested in off-leaf training [50:06] i have to hide it from my dogs because [50:08] if they see it they become so excited [50:10] because they think we're going somewhere [50:11] because i only use it if i'm going [50:12] somewhere where they're going to be off [50:14] leash [50:14] right so they see the caller come out [50:15] and they're like we're going where are [50:17] we going are we going to the beach are [50:18] we going on a hike [50:19] right and for me it's my safety net you [50:21] know if i was practicing [50:23] i don't know what it's called when [50:24] you're doing the stuff at a circus or [50:26] swinging around [50:27] you know they have their safety net in [50:28] case they fall nobody wants to fall into [50:30] the safety net [50:31] but it's nice to have it there yeah in [50:34] case you need it [50:35] and that's really what it is because [50:36] once a dog's trained on a remote collar [50:38] i almost never have to use it right you [50:41] can have a [50:41] what's it called a furby or something [50:43] like grant it's like a [50:45] it's kind of like a choke chain but it's [50:47] not really attached hanging there [50:48] i guess it's kind of like a reminder [50:50] they think it might be where the i don't [50:52] understand it completely [50:53] that actually just made me think of [50:54] those new you see these new collars that [50:56] are coming out they've been out for a [50:58] couple years now maybe five years [50:59] but i think they're really cool they're [51:01] callers that have a gps tracker in it [51:03] yeah so they're great yeah if you live [51:05] somewhere where you're worried maybe [51:06] you're right you're worried about your [51:07] dog in a way like the microchip is great [51:10] you know you should definitely have your [51:11] dogs microchipped is that something that [51:13] you do with your service dogs [51:14] before they go to all of them are [51:16] microchip yep [51:18] super important these colors are cool [51:19] because if somehow [51:21] your dog does another responsible [51:22] breeder tendency [51:24] is to ship their dogs that's of course [51:27] if you're well [51:28] i mean you're training them to be [51:29] service dogs so you're giving that yeah [51:31] but like a puppy you're not able to [51:33] microchip usually until they're a little [51:35] bit [51:36] no but you can yes you can some reason i [51:38] was thinking [51:39] six weeks old gus was microchipped at um [51:42] six six weeks old his first i know where [51:45] my confusion came from [51:47] a lot of times veterinarians recommend [51:48] that if you're going to spay [51:50] or neuter right the puppy when you get [51:52] them to wait till you do that to [51:54] microchip [51:55] right because then you know the dogs [51:57] already know after the surgery they just [51:58] add that into that [51:59] and that's one way to brought that up [52:01] that's one area [52:02] you know veteran veterinarians are great [52:05] but [52:07] they're not some of them are breeders [52:08] the old vets were a lot of them were [52:10] breeders [52:11] um not so much anymore a lot of the [52:13] veterinarians are pushing more of the [52:14] adopt [52:14] don't show up against the breeder type [52:16] thing but um you should never spare [52:19] neutral dog [52:20] at six months old like they suggest [52:23] what i see i've heard so many different [52:26] time frames on when to do it [52:28] and i honestly don't know what's the [52:29] best and a lot of people i think they [52:31] don't know [52:32] either because there's a lot of [52:33] information on it i [52:35] um spay and neuter my dogs when they're [52:37] 15 months old [52:38] i feel like they give has given them [52:39] time for their hormones to have the male [52:41] 1 [52:42] that's what i've heard too yeah and it [52:43] does affect you know um [52:45] i've heard waiting until two years so [52:47] they reach full maturity [52:48] yeah that gives them time to develop the [52:51] way that they're supposed to be right [52:53] you know um another example if you're [52:56] looking for a [52:57] a reputable breeder don't buy one that [52:59] breeds their dogs back to back all the [53:01] time [53:02] and a lot of the younger breeders are [53:05] breeding dogs before they're [53:06] a year old like when they first come in [53:07] the first season and [53:09] this is kind of an old-fashioned thing i [53:11] will always stick to [53:12] i do not breed my dogs until their [53:16] at least have their after their second [53:17] heat you know their babies [53:20] you know they're still developing their [53:22] self um [53:23] i've seen some dogs when they were bred [53:25] at eight months old [53:27] and you can look at their teeth and it's [53:29] like calcium deficiency [53:31] their teeth start eroding away so um [53:34] they're not ready to have babies at nine [53:36] months i mean [53:37] puppies grow so fast and grow up so fast [53:40] i mean [53:41] nine months is no time for a puppy so um [53:44] i don't breed them and i only breed my [53:46] kennel dogs [53:48] i mean um near my kennel dogs if they if [53:51] they need it [53:51] i usually do not neuter my dogs i can [53:54] keep them separated [53:55] keep them from breathing yeah so um [53:58] unless i'm placing them somewhere if i [54:00] go to place any of my dogs are always [54:02] neutered or spayed [54:05] now i know you're training mostly or [54:07] you're [54:08] breeding your puppies are mostly going [54:10] into your service dog program [54:12] uh are you still offering puppies to [54:15] the public if they want a good family [54:17] pet or yeah like that um [54:18] usually if i have a litter and i have um [54:21] colleagues can range from having one [54:22] puppy to 12 i've had [54:24] at all in between and um if i have a [54:27] litter that [54:28] i usually have people that's asked for [54:30] my puppies i had a bunch of inquiries [54:32] this last time um and i check them out [54:35] they have to fill out application [54:37] most of time and always i never ship my [54:40] puppies i either travel with them or [54:42] drive them there yeah i don't ship my [54:45] puppies [54:46] i mean so much can happen to them on the [54:47] plane um [54:49] so that's another good um way to check [54:53] out a breeder [54:54] but um yeah every time i've i've gotten [54:57] a puppy i've traveled to the location [54:59] yeah [54:59] yeah you don't know a lot of people ship [55:01] and i'm sure a lot of times it's fine [55:02] and i've wondered [55:04] but i would i would hate a dog just to [55:06] be and usually they're young like [55:08] 10 weeks 12 weeks old just put on a [55:10] plane [55:12] so i did ship one to italy but [55:16] the guy had a actual person come [55:19] get him actually he does this for a [55:22] living [55:22] a transporter type thing and it's a i [55:25] don't know what kind of plane it was [55:27] it's a plane for that [55:28] so that's the only way i would let him [55:31] go he went to italy [55:32] but you're trying overall to minimize [55:35] the amount of [55:36] uh bad experiences that may possibly [55:39] happen even though [55:40] it could quite possibly be completely [55:43] okay every single day [55:45] right the off chance that maybe [55:46] something unpleasant happens yeah [55:48] creates this bad experience for the [55:50] coffee that it could affect them for [55:51] their entire life [55:53] you know because that is the most [55:54] important time is from when they're [55:56] born to 16 weeks right now i'm kind of [55:58] curious on what your opinion is on this [56:00] because if you look up [56:02] uh the age of a puppy the imprinting [56:05] stage [56:06] almost everywhere says 8 to 16 weeks now [56:09] i [56:09] always say it's from when they're born [56:11] until 16 weeks i say that's their [56:13] imprinting stage [56:14] that's why some dogs have such a problem [56:16] with you clipping their nails they're [56:17] actually like [56:18] they're humans privates actually [56:21] that's how pretty much tender they can [56:23] be to the dog yeah [56:25] so that's very important um even sitting [56:28] watching when you're watching you can do [56:29] these things while you're doing [56:30] things watching tv as a two week old [56:33] puppy [56:33] um usually i wait and have the mother [56:36] outside because she's usually having fit [56:37] but she hears the puppy or sees he's [56:39] gone i lay him right here [56:41] and i talk to him and let him hear the [56:43] tv and [56:44] different noises so yeah i would say [56:45] imprinting starts at birth [56:47] i'm glad it might even be earlier than [56:49] that yeah i mean because you know [56:51] i've seen puppies that have come from [56:54] you know back bad situations yeah and uh [56:57] let's say [56:58] the well-being box wasn't kept clean the [57:01] dogs or the puppies weren't kept clean [57:02] right then they're filthy yes i had this [57:06] one dog that [57:07] it did not matter if you put him in a [57:10] crate he would [57:11] go number two and he would lay and it [57:13] can be there forever [57:14] you know um grant has a [57:17] oh man he has a dog that was kept in a [57:20] condition kind of like that and [57:22] the dog is almost two and he has to [57:25] clean his crate [57:26] every day it's hard to break yeah [57:28] college is pretty easy [57:29] with that they don't like they like to [57:31] be clean yeah i mean i feel like most of [57:33] them do like to be clean and that's why [57:35] that welping box being kept clean is so [57:37] important you know because like i said i [57:39] had one dog that [57:40] came from a very dirty situation yeah [57:42] and the dog [57:43] was okay being dirty and this goes back [57:46] to motivation [57:47] right you know a dog will always do [57:48] whatever's most motivating now [57:50] a dog that is kept the way you do it [57:52] right it's clean [57:53] everything's organized i mean you're [57:54] cleaning that out three four or five [57:56] times a day [57:57] right you know yeah it's a concept yeah [58:00] it is but it does it's just work it's a [58:02] lot it's a lot of work yeah [58:04] and puppy raising is so important so i'd [58:06] say i would say yes i'm praying just [58:08] like [58:09] um with humans the daddy always talks [58:11] into the belly of the mama [58:13] so you know that if you think about it [58:15] that's imprinting oh yeah is for humans [58:17] i mean they [58:18] recognize the father's voice they say um [58:22] and like you said earlier too where you [58:24] say you like to provide [58:25] uh affection towards each dog so they [58:28] know they're cared for [58:29] right you know that is something that i [58:31] agree with cesar milano yeah and cesar [58:33] milan says if you want a balanced dog [58:35] they need mental [58:36] physical stimulation every day and they [58:39] need affection every day right why [58:40] should be any different [58:41] that's what we need right yeah why do [58:44] you think they're any different than us [58:45] really [58:45] absolutely and i try to follow that with [58:48] my own dogs i try to give them some sort [58:50] of mental stimulation yeah today [58:51] some sort of physical exercise and then [58:54] you know i like my snuggle time at night [58:56] right [58:57] when i finish my work i sit down on the [58:59] couch both of my dogs pretty much sit on [59:01] top of what [59:02] and i enjoy it i think as much as they [59:03] do yeah you do my dog ari grabs her [59:06] little [59:06] breast relief oh yeah from the day [59:08] because um [59:10] dogs are so much easier life than people [59:13] and i love people i do love people a lot [59:16] but um [59:16] i see i always say i love dogs i like [59:18] people but i love [59:20] dogs yeah and um i i mean i love people [59:23] a lot so [59:24] they're just easier they're easier and [59:26] they show they always [59:28] show love back no matter what you do [59:30] they don't hold grudges [59:32] we could go on and on about how awesome [59:33] dogs are yeah we could [59:35] we could other is there anything else as [59:37] far as [59:38] advice or tips that you can give the [59:41] audience that is out there trying to [59:43] train their own service dog [59:45] that you could think of maybe things you [59:47] ran into with socializing or [59:49] training or nutrition [59:52] or whatever um i think pretty much [59:56] everything we talked about i think um [59:59] find a good trainer that is [60:02] connects with the dog if you're going to [60:04] watch them on youtube there's so much on [60:06] youtube we can learn [60:07] now well there's a lot i mean if we want [60:09] to point out good youtube channels [60:12] michael ellis is on lear burke's so he [60:14] has a lot of great videos from him [60:16] i'm a big fan of force mickey as well he [60:18] has a lot of good stuff on there [60:20] you have robert cabral robert cabral i'm [60:22] not he's [60:23] really good as well i think i'm messing [60:25] up his name [60:26] a little bit there's a trainer in north [60:28] carolina i can't remember what her name [60:30] is [60:32] but she's pretty good and her channel's [60:33] starting to grow pretty fast [60:35] there's another canine one i'll just you [60:37] know what for the description for those [60:38] watching i'll just put [60:40] all the links all the different youtube [60:42] channels that i think [60:43] provide value even one that people back [60:45] so a lot of people bash [60:46] on zach george yeah now zach george has [60:50] the [60:51] biggest dog training youtube channel [60:53] right [60:54] now i've watched every single one of not [60:56] every single one of any [60:58] particular tree but i've watched a lot [60:59] of dog trainer videos out there [61:01] to see what type of information people [61:03] are getting and zach george is not as [61:05] bad as a lot of these other like dog [61:07] trainers just feel the need to bash on [61:09] him [61:09] but you can learn a lot of good stuff [61:11] from his channel [61:12] the only thing you have to realize is [61:14] that so like for me i do [61:16] my process is step one engagement [61:18] training step two teaching the behaviors [61:20] and this is aside from socializing and [61:22] all that other stuff of course that we [61:24] want to do [61:24] right step three i teach the leash [61:26] pressure step four i add the command [61:28] step five i teach the stay with the [61:29] pressure step six i [61:30] add corrections for reliability he just [61:33] doesn't do the corrections [61:34] and he doesn't do the leash pressure but [61:36] everything else that i do he does [61:38] pretty much the same you know he just [61:40] doesn't have those other elements so [61:43] you still want to even look at even if [61:44] you're a balanced trainer you could [61:45] still learn from that [61:46] you can always learn from somebody else [61:48] there's good information [61:50] everywhere i think what people need to [61:52] learn not just on people [61:53] looking to train the service dog but [61:55] trainers and maybe even just people in [61:57] general [61:57] is not to be so negative to one another [62:00] especially in your own field [62:01] oh i can't stand i mean it's number one [62:04] it really makes only person that makes [62:06] bad [62:07] look bad is the one being so negative [62:09] right it's kind of like [62:10] everybody looks at it and says what an [62:12] idiot yeah i know i do [62:14] yeah and um because like you said we can [62:17] learn from each other [62:19] and just because you don't do it the way [62:22] mike ellis or tom rose does does not [62:24] mean the guys are wrong [62:26] it's just the way they've learned or [62:27] maybe that's how they have adapted to [62:29] doing training [62:30] so i think um there's enough dogs out [62:33] there trained for everybody [62:34] yes i don't think it has to be a [62:36] competition i think we always do better [62:39] when we lift [62:39] people up than put them down i i [62:42] couldn't agree more if you see something [62:43] like [62:44] you don't like stroll on you don't have [62:47] to comment on everything well and here's [62:48] the thing too [62:49] pretty much every dog trainer out there [62:52] professional or non-professional [62:54] what's the difference between a [62:55] professional dog trainer and a regular [62:57] dog trainer well the professional gets [62:58] paid [62:58] right that's the only difference right [63:00] if you're training your own dog at home [63:01] you're a dog trainer trainer [63:03] you're a breeder and you train your dogs [63:05] you're a dog trainer [63:06] we are all dog trainers and we are dog [63:08] trainers because we [63:10] care about dogs because we love dogs and [63:13] we're all trying to do what we believe [63:15] is best [63:16] for that dog so the best way to look at [63:18] it is just like you said [63:19] open-minded i may find i've learned [63:22] techniques from and i'm using zac george [63:24] because he's the most well-known pure [63:25] positive [63:25] i've used techniques i've learned from [63:27] his channel i've used techniques i've [63:29] learned from robert's channel [63:30] i've used techniques that i learned from [63:32] uh this other guy i can't think of his [63:34] name gosh darn it [63:35] yeah but you know i've been able to [63:37] learn different things and [63:39] it may not even be something that you [63:40] 100 percent like okay i'm going to use [63:42] it [63:42] but maybe eighty percent of that i can [63:45] take bits and pieces and i can create [63:46] something that works perfectly for the [63:48] dog that i'm working with so [63:50] you take a little bit of everything and [63:52] you may not have [63:53] invented the certain thing but you do [63:56] your own program [63:57] it's your own program i mean you didn't [64:00] steal it from anybody everybody else [64:02] kind of uses some of it but you we all [64:04] need to steal from each other [64:05] yeah yeah because we can all learn from [64:07] each other absolutely [64:08] everybody can learn i can learn from my [64:10] grandson yeah i can learn from my [64:12] um three-year-old granddaughter there's [64:15] things [64:16] we can learn from each other i'm a huge [64:18] fan of joe rogan [64:19] and joe rogan is if you watch his [64:22] podcast [64:23] so i'm sure a lot of my followers and [64:25] viewers watch joe rogan [64:27] he's always trying to build everybody [64:29] else up yeah [64:30] he's not trying to build anyone or push [64:32] anyone down he's like you should start a [64:33] podcast i'll help you [64:35] do this you need to do this you need to [64:36] do that as well and he's trying to build [64:38] everybody else up and that's kind of [64:40] what i want i want to follow that right [64:42] do what he kind of does [64:44] yeah i think we can be more supportive [64:46] of each other even [64:48] yeah even if somebody texts you or um [64:50] that's one good thing you don't [64:52] you see something on facebook you don't [64:53] have to do it publicly if you have [64:55] you have a real concern or question then [64:57] you can um [64:58] message them and do it politely and [65:00] privately that's how it should be done [65:02] yeah [65:03] and not um like you're trying to be mr [65:06] i know everything yeah i mean in fact on [65:09] my own channel i've had people ask [65:10] questions [65:11] yeah on certain things that i haven't [65:13] made videos on [65:15] right i have other trainers that i think [65:17] are good on youtube like they're not my [65:19] trainers you know [65:19] other youtube dog trainers and i'll find [65:22] the video that that person did that i [65:23] think was very well made [65:24] and i'll send that to them right like [65:26] here check out this video you should [65:28] also follow them they're really good [65:30] yeah they're very informative they may [65:31] have something that i [65:33] don't or that i don't know about even i [65:35] mean i definitely don't know [65:36] everything about dog training i've only [65:38] been doing this for nine years [65:40] right you know there's people out there [65:42] that have been doing it for 30 years 40 [65:43] years [65:44] and they have all that you know time and [65:47] experience [65:47] right to add a lot of value and even [65:49] those people like when i was talking to [65:51] tom rose [65:52] tom rose is like oh yeah i'm still [65:53] learning he is and [65:55] they can all they can also learn from [65:57] younger people yes because [65:59] there's a lot of things that were done [66:00] in the past that are not the best way to [66:02] do it [66:03] and i think a good trainer is [66:05] open-minded yes [66:06] to that no matter how old they are and i [66:07] think you have to be open-minded [66:10] maybe that per you know try it for [66:11] yourself and see how it works well yeah [66:13] i've even worked with animal [66:14] behavioralists [66:15] yeah and you know people are always [66:17] asking too like what's the difference [66:18] between a dog trainer and [66:19] animal behavioralist for example i would [66:21] say cesar milan is more of an [66:24] animal behavioralist right i mean even [66:26] if you go to his [66:27] website it says we don't teach dogs sit [66:29] and down that's not what we do [66:31] right that's what behaviorless is more [66:33] about the dog's behavior analyzing it [66:35] and setting up the home environment like [66:37] we were talking about earlier about the [66:38] um [66:39] aggressive dog and how you handle it [66:41] like sitting [66:42] outside the kennel with your back to the [66:44] dog [66:45] that's more of a behavior you have an [66:47] aggressive dog [66:49] you're trying to kind of get through to [66:51] the dog [66:52] even if it's not for too many people to [66:54] handle the dog the dog needs care [66:56] um say like if you're working at a vet's [66:58] office or um [67:00] even a shelter or whatever you get [67:01] certain dogs [67:03] and they're just fearful and you know [67:05] they're gonna buy they will bite [67:07] but you can um use some of those skills [67:11] maybe you're the one that can break [67:13] through tool maybe you're the one that [67:14] should adopt that dog [67:15] and take it home so he's not put to [67:17] sleep because he's a great dog at home [67:19] you can keep him isolated from other [67:21] people now speaking of other [67:24] resources out there that can help people [67:26] and help them with their dogs and their [67:27] training [67:28] are there any books that you would [67:29] recommend or any programs you would [67:31] recommend to people watching [67:33] uh like me i always recommend if [67:35] somebody is thinking of becoming a [67:37] breeder [67:37] i say get the dvd set of puppy culture [67:42] right watch the entire thing study it [67:44] it's broken down in a brilliant way to [67:46] really give you a good understanding of [67:47] the type of work and commitment [67:49] that's going to go into doing it if it's [67:50] something you want to pursue [67:52] are there any books that you might [67:54] recommend you said you've read a lot of [67:55] dog training [67:56] books or any video courses anything [67:59] yeah i think the best thing to do is um [68:01] if you're looking [68:02] for if you're looking for number one if [68:04] you don't can't decide what breed [68:06] you really want um maybe i mean i think [68:10] purebred dogs make wonderful service [68:12] dogs so i would recommend going to maybe [68:14] your one of your akc shows [68:16] and watching go just like um watch the [68:20] dogs [68:20] see which ones actually appeal to you um [68:23] through your eye which ones you [68:25] you like and maybe contact some of those [68:28] breeders and talk to them [68:30] um look look them up on the akc standard [68:32] what their standard is what they were [68:33] bred [68:34] very important to see what they were [68:35] bred to do um i mean [68:38] like like we were talking about the [68:39] border collie is a awesome dog [68:42] awesomely smart but if you're a couch [68:45] potato you're not the right dog [68:47] they're so smart they get and colleagues [68:48] are like that too they're so smart they [68:50] get bored easy [68:51] yeah they get bored easy so that may not [68:53] be the dog for you [68:54] um that's another thing i think on [68:58] is playing with them yeah huge that can [69:00] be a big motive i'm glad you mentioned [69:02] that [69:02] playing with them yeah so i get down [69:04] there and play with my dogs and um they [69:06] love it [69:06] it's like they'll wait on that you know [69:08] like you were talking about [69:09] extending out the rewards i think they [69:12] know in the end [69:13] nate's gonna play with me he's gonna [69:14] throw the frisbee that's their reward [69:16] and i think they work up [69:18] they work up to that it's so important [69:20] for bonnie too it's like [69:22] ariel ari aria out there well loving it [69:25] didn't you [69:26] love playing i could already even see [69:28] just with the puppy that you brought so [69:30] young already still very focused on you [69:32] yeah because you spent that extra time [69:34] even when they're so young i think play [69:36] is so important people ask me they're [69:37] like how important is play [69:39] i say play is almost more important if [69:41] not more important than obedience [69:43] yeah i mean i play with my dogs and the [69:45] dogs i train [69:46] significantly more than right then i [69:48] train them [69:49] i play with them all the time i think [69:50] that imprinting stage can go for [69:52] even longer than the weeks i think maybe [69:54] even earlier and longer because [69:57] chance this is um grant was still at [70:00] tom rose when um i started training [70:03] chance from [70:04] you know i started from day one really [70:06] but really training for [70:08] i social i was doing i was doing all the [70:10] social stuff i wasn't [70:11] doing in the training but he become so i [70:14] guess imprinted to me [70:15] attached to me when we were trained i [70:18] couldn't even be around he's like i [70:19] don't want you [70:20] because it's like he looked at me like [70:21] do i have to or is this right [70:23] well because you were the most [70:25] motivating factor to him yeah yeah and [70:27] even after we placed him [70:28] i went to speak at aubrey school because [70:31] they were given i had to go remind them [70:33] of the ada they were [70:34] they were not listening obviously they [70:36] didn't study i'd already talked to him [70:38] on the phone sent him a letter [70:39] they still wouldn't let her bring a [70:41] chance to school so um [70:43] when he called me and i said let me come [70:44] talk to all the kids [70:46] all the classes and um so i did [70:49] and i was amazed at how great the kids [70:51] understood [70:52] not to bother a service dog i mean they [70:54] were that's one thing that's changed too [70:55] i think [70:56] um people are learning don't touch the [70:58] service dogs they're doing a job [70:59] most people are i think the kids are [71:01] better than the adults at it i really do [71:03] and um so we had a table i told him [71:07] i was trying kind of demonstrating and [71:09] how they should respond to him [71:10] and what he was going to be doing at [71:11] school and she was there with me she was [71:14] like handle doing the handling [71:15] and i was explaining what was happening [71:17] and how they should react if something [71:18] happened or how [71:19] they should just ignore them basically [71:21] what i said well she was on that end of [71:23] the table holding the lead [71:24] right he got under the table and he was [71:26] like crawling over [71:28] to me and i was like he just wanted to [71:30] be with me and i was like [71:32] no get back over there so i stay away [71:35] from him a good bit now i'm like there [71:37] needs to be a break here [71:39] when i go to visit and check on him he's [71:41] all over me all up in my lap [71:42] loving me grant said because when grant [71:45] was doing [71:46] the k-9 good citizen you know with them [71:48] and everything um [71:50] we let actually that's one thing we do [71:52] we make sure we do the k-9 business [71:54] canine good system with us and then we [71:56] let the handler especially if it's a [71:58] child [71:58] do it and they get the ribbon and stuff [72:00] like that so they know how to handle the [72:01] dough handle the dog because there's a [72:02] lot of things [72:03] um you know like them making the dog sit [72:07] and stay and then going away [72:08] and the dog knows he has to stay there [72:10] until she gets back well um [72:12] he said you just need to stay you need [72:14] to stay inside [72:15] it's funny that you mentioned that [72:16] because that's something that i was [72:18] doing [72:19] last week intentionally separating jet [72:22] for those that watched my clicker [72:23] episode that puppy jet i was separating [72:26] from [72:26] spock because they were becoming almost [72:28] too attached yeah [72:29] that i didn't want either one of them to [72:31] develop separation anxiety when jet had [72:33] to go home [72:34] yeah and so we intentionally had to [72:36] start separating just like [72:37] separating you yeah from the puppy so [72:40] they didn't they don't get that [72:41] separation [72:41] i believe and i go we do that's another [72:43] thing we do with um [72:45] we go back and check on we make sure [72:46] everything's going okay and so when we [72:48] do go back i don't know [72:50] i mean he hasn't when he hears me ring [72:52] the d when i ring the doorbell he can [72:54] see out the window he [72:55] hasn't fit so what i told him i said um [72:58] grant was there with me i said go put [73:00] you know put him on his [73:01] climb i'm gonna go back outside you're [73:04] gonna stand there you can correct him [73:05] when he jumps up [73:06] and um i rang the doorbell and he tried [73:09] to get she [73:10] correct trying to teach her how to do [73:11] the corrections and stuff because [73:13] we can't be there all the time we don't [73:14] want him to slip too far you know [73:17] if you're not the trainer they let them [73:19] most even the dogs grant trains they [73:21] kind of [73:21] they don't go they don't revert all the [73:23] way back but you can see they've gotten [73:24] slack [73:25] because a lot of times the owners are [73:27] not going to continue [73:28] and that's why the follow-ups are so [73:30] important good so and i like that you [73:32] keep in contact you continue to help and [73:34] continue to train and work with them [73:36] now one thing i want to do before we [73:37] finish this episode [73:39] is is there anything that my viewers can [73:42] do [73:42] to support your mission of training [73:45] service dog because [73:46] service dogs are in such high demand [73:48] right now people can't afford them [73:50] most people can't train their own [73:51] service dog and there's not that many [73:53] resources out there available to them [73:56] so the ones that do need it all of us [73:58] need to come together as a whole [73:59] collectively [74:00] to help them become uh to be in a [74:03] situation in order to get the service [74:05] dog and your organization helps provide [74:06] that but it's also not free for you [74:08] no it's not you know it costs a lot of [74:09] money it costs a lot of time [74:11] is there any way people can donate to [74:13] the non-profit or can they buy one of [74:15] your shirts off the website [74:17] what can they do to help support and one [74:19] thing i'm gonna do i don't know if [74:20] you're aware of this [74:21] but once a month all the stuff that [74:23] comes in from my patreon [74:24] goes towards something so we're gonna [74:25] send it to you guys oh wow it's not that [74:28] much it's a small amount so [74:30] it's only i think it's at around 300 [74:31] bucks that's wonderful so i'm going to [74:33] ask when you go back to do some video [74:35] with [74:36] grant and some of the training to show [74:37] people what you guys are doing okay but [74:40] yeah so they're gonna you're gonna get [74:41] that 300 from my patreon account [74:43] but what else can they do to help [74:45] support you guys in any way i mean [74:47] uh i'll even create a shirt and sell it [74:50] on my website and all the profits will [74:52] go to you guys for that as well [74:54] okay what else can they do that's great [74:56] well um [74:58] you can go on to palmettoservicedogs.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 169/841,3 [78:18] my wife is our accountant and she does [78:21] um all our [78:22] she helps you know what it is setting up [78:24] a non-profit oh it's a lot of work a lot [78:26] of work so she's [78:27] even with just the accounting and [78:28] setting it up well if 91 [78:31] or more of what's donated goes into the [78:34] actual mission right that's considered [78:36] exceptional [78:37] right so a lot of non-profits try to [78:39] keep [78:40] nine percent or less used towards paying [78:43] employees [78:44] paying trainers pay whatever and it [78:46] sounds like [78:47] around 95 percent of yours goes towards [78:50] it does so 95 cents out of every dollar [78:52] goes directly in the mission and then [78:54] five percent is paying staff [78:56] right my kennel which is emory pines um [78:58] donates the dogs [78:59] so i'm not having to go buy a 2500 dog [79:02] or whatever [79:03] and so um that you know that's pretty [79:06] much covered and i [79:08] i usually donate my money to take care [79:10] of the vetting [79:11] i try to do that because especially with [79:14] the pandemics [79:15] it really has hurt a lot of non-profits [79:18] everybody's just trying to keep and my [79:20] wife being an accountant she sees [79:22] all the she does a lot of their books [79:24] and stuff she said you're not the only [79:26] one [79:26] you know she said this is the way it is [79:29] right now so [79:30] um because a lot of times with a [79:31] non-profit it's a lot of work [79:33] and sometimes you think this why am i [79:36] doing it [79:37] and then i remind myself of like the [79:39] people i've helped and that's all it [79:41] really takes don't take too long to [79:42] think about it [79:43] but the impact sometimes you do get [79:44] discouraged [79:46] because um you have a lot of people want [79:49] a dog which is great that's what we want [79:50] to provide [79:51] but you have a lot less want to support [79:55] and so um we have fundraisers from time [79:58] to time [79:58] like the chances choices i wrote a [80:00] children's book which is pretty good i [80:02] mean [80:02] when i have i usually post them on [80:04] facebook and stuff [80:05] and you should make a book on training [80:09] a service dog yeah have grant start [80:11] writing it [80:12] that's what i should do huh yeah i have [80:13] my trainer right there to tell me what [80:15] you know exactly what to i know the [80:18] puppy raising and the socializing i'm [80:21] pretty good at that [80:22] um all that could be in the book too my [80:24] training was a little a little bit [80:25] outdated [80:26] i mean it was like now that i look back [80:29] at it i'm like no [80:30] don't do that let grant let grant do [80:32] this he's [80:33] we all learn yeah and he has he's had [80:35] great success and [80:36] you know i really do i really am proud [80:38] of him i mean um [80:40] i appreciate everybody's support it [80:42] really doesn't matter [80:43] if it's five dollars or if it's five [80:45] hundred dollars um [80:47] i realized that we would not exist [80:48] without our donors [80:51] they are as big a part of helping these [80:53] people and provide these dogs as i am [80:55] oh yeah and it doesn't matter to me how [80:58] much you [80:59] gave i mean i do appreciate large [81:00] amounts i don't want to say that [81:02] you don't but you know i want to just [81:05] say i appreciate any donation that you [81:07] can give [81:07] because we need it and um we only exist [81:09] because of our donors [81:10] yeah and so because they do [81:14] give us the opportunity to do what it is [81:15] that we do you know [81:17] this is not sponsored by nate sherman [81:20] his [81:20] his manual and i truly say this i've [81:22] read a lot of the books [81:24] and some of them i'm like yes it's good [81:28] info [81:28] a lot of good information fluff it's [81:30] probably what you really need to know if [81:32] some of it's what you really need to [81:34] know if you're going to be a trainer [81:36] but it's as far as practical and [81:40] um great for a person that maybe the [81:43] first per [81:44] time trying to train their dog that's [81:46] the book that you're really going to get [81:48] something out of and not really kind of [81:49] get bored or frustrated and put it down [81:51] i appreciate it you can sit down i sit [81:53] down and read it pretty much [81:54] in one and i'm not a reader i don't i [81:56] ain't crazy about reading [81:58] and um so when i can sit down there i [82:00] can read it all the way through while [82:01] i'm keeping my grandkids [82:02] it's pretty good and having the youtube [82:05] channels to go to [82:07] i felt like especially if you don't have [82:09] a great memory [82:10] and remember everything or you remember [82:11] things a little bit differently that [82:13] book kind of puts you back you can [82:15] when i was reading it i could think back [82:17] on the very video that you did [82:19] and i was like that's it that's it so [82:22] yeah i love his book [82:23] i definitely would um it's worth a lot [82:26] more than [82:27] what you paid for it for amazon i can [82:28] promise you that i appreciate that [82:30] i mean you know the book wouldn't be [82:32] where it is if it wasn't for all my [82:33] supporters [82:34] i really appreciate you coming down in [82:37] your puppy that i'm [82:38] so excited to train and work with thank [82:40] you again

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 172/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] [Music] [00:08] bang bang [00:10] [Music] [00:20] today i'm going to explain and [00:21] demonstrate how to teach your dog or [00:23] your puppy [00:24] the play dead trick or the bang trick is [00:26] what some people call it [00:27] it's very simple you want to make sure [00:29] your dog knows the marker so that's [00:30] going to be our communication channels [00:32] this is the word or sound that predicts [00:34] the reward in the video that you just [00:36] saw where i demonstrated the technique i [00:37] used the word [00:38] free for spock that means release and [00:41] reward [00:42] just keep in mind what the words predict [00:44] and that's what they mean to our dogs [00:46] so the first thing we want to do is [00:47] teach our dog the physical cue [00:49] this is what we're going to use to get [00:51] our dog to do the behavior [00:52] the way i like to do it was with luring [00:54] now if you have a dog that understands [00:56] how to follow a lure [00:57] this should be pretty easy but some dogs [00:59] don't want to lay on their side [01:01] i'm going to demonstrate with four dogs [01:03] each one slightly different [01:04] but i got them all to the point of [01:06] following the lure so we have spock here [01:08] come on big guy [01:10] and if you want to teach this and you [01:13] also want to teach a down [01:14] or you want to teach a rollover what you [01:16] want to keep in mind is [01:18] if you're going to do these you teach [01:19] down first make sure your dog knows that [01:21] command [01:22] the second one you would do is play dead [01:24] and the last one would be roll over [01:27] you don't want to start with roll over [01:28] because then it could be very difficult [01:30] to teach play dead because your dog's [01:32] going to want to roll over [01:33] so all we want to do is bring our dog [01:35] into the down position [01:36] using a lure that we use all the time [01:38] and then i'm simply going to rotate my [01:40] hand [01:41] getting him onto the side mark and [01:43] reward [01:44] now when we add the command come here [01:46] baby again it's just straight down [01:49] turn mark reward [01:52] sit bring them up into a sit good boy [01:56] and then i'm gonna do the cue so down [01:59] rotate [01:59] yes reward or you can use your terminal [02:02] marker either marker is going to be okay [02:04] remember when we're just teaching our [02:06] dog the physical cue to get them to [02:07] perform the behavior [02:09] since we're not putting it on a command [02:11] then we can use our terminal marker or [02:13] our continuation marker either one's [02:15] okay [02:16] but once we start to put it on command [02:18] then we want to use our terminal marker [02:20] just like everything else when we say [02:22] the command it has to come [02:24] what you doing buddy it has to come [02:28] before the physical cue so we go bang [02:31] bang [02:32] then the q free reward good job my [02:35] little [02:36] man and if they maintain that position [02:38] that is a good opportunity to say yes [02:40] and reinforce that as well because when [02:42] they play dead we like them to hold the [02:44] position for a second [02:45] just like that frank good boy so break [02:48] is my release word it just means release [02:50] so again we say bang bang then we do the [02:53] q [02:54] later you can add the little the hand [02:57] signal but [02:59] with some people it actually helps when [03:01] teaching the command [03:02] to add the physical kind of bang bang [03:05] whatever you want to call it [03:07] because it helps prevent you from [03:09] pairing your physical with your verbal [03:11] meaning this is a common mistake you got [03:13] something stuck in your teeth [03:14] the common mistake people make is they [03:16] go bang bang they do the physical cue [03:19] the exact same time that they say the [03:21] command what we want to do is we want to [03:23] separate it so if it helps you [03:25] come here buddy you can literally sorry [03:28] you can literally do this bang bang and [03:31] then do the cue [03:33] free and then reward you want to keep [03:35] doing it up until the point where you [03:37] say the command [03:38] bang bang and your dog does the [03:40] technique just like little spock here [03:42] demonstrated [03:43] and if you do it correctly it shouldn't [03:44] take you that long to teach i [03:46] literally started this with spock on [03:48] saturday and he's already doing it like [03:50] a pro [03:50] let's bring out the other dog so i can [03:52] show you how it looks when we're working [03:53] with different sizes [03:55] and different levels of obedience now we [03:57] have cute little ducky here [03:58] or jet we like to call him ducky now [04:01] when i first started teaching [04:02] ducky this he didn't want to go with the [04:05] rotation when i went to turn he wouldn't [04:07] flip over on his side like he's doing [04:08] right now [04:09] so in order to get him to do that what i [04:12] like to do with dogs [04:13] is i like to just pet them and get them [04:15] to where [04:16] they choose one hip or the other so most [04:19] dogs are going to have a preference on [04:20] which side they prefer to lay [04:22] and if that's the case i'll pet them [04:24] until they get to that side so i'll pet [04:26] them like this [04:27] give him a little belly rub make him [04:28] like that position [04:30] and reward him then once they're sitting [04:31] like this where you can see his hips are [04:33] kind of shifted off to the side [04:34] then i'll pet as i tilt good [04:38] and i'll reward so it took a little bit [04:40] extra effort to get him to do this and [04:42] that may be the case with your dogs [04:44] free and if it is just be patient with [04:48] it [04:48] take your time so what i also had to do [04:50] with him when i got him on the side i [04:52] had to pet him to keep him there i had [04:54] to be like good boy very nice [04:56] and if he got up i would bring him back [04:57] into the position and reward [05:00] but if you do it correctly you should be [05:02] able to get it to a point [05:03] where just like with spock and jet here [05:06] we can simply turn our hand [05:08] and get them to flip on their side like [05:10] that and like i said before then we add [05:12] the command [05:12] there was a couple times too when i was [05:14] working with him [05:16] he didn't want to flip to his side and [05:18] so what i did was i pet him like this [05:19] he already knows i pet him and then i [05:22] just grabbed his body and turned it a [05:23] little bit and continued petting him [05:25] you just want to make sure you're not [05:26] really trying to force because [05:28] what happens if you try to force them [05:30] it's going to kick in their classical [05:32] opposition reflex and they're going to [05:33] resist they're going to kick the leg out [05:35] and they're going to try to resist [05:36] so by petting them and getting them [05:38] comfortable shifting their hips and [05:39] relaxing [05:40] it makes it much easier once you want to [05:43] add that physical cue rotating over [05:45] mark and reward and just like with spock [05:48] then we would add the command he doesn't [05:49] know the command yet but we'd go bang [05:51] bang [05:51] and then we cue free reward or we can go [05:54] bang bang [05:55] cue free reward and then we continue to [05:58] do it until we say bang bang [06:00] and he flops over all on his own all [06:03] right let's get the next pup good job [06:04] ducky way to go little superstar [06:06] little superstar and then let's see him [06:08] do a little spin for us [06:10] spin oh that's not it there we go i had [06:12] to help him that's okay [06:14] come on big guy now we have ari here of [06:16] course very high energy [06:18] older dog she was able to pick up on it [06:20] very quickly because [06:21] she's one of those types of dogs that [06:23] likes to continue to work in order to [06:24] get to that reward very high level of [06:26] perseverance [06:27] but you can see when i do it with her [06:29] her body is going to be a little [06:31] different than the puppies she's a [06:32] little bit more i guess you can say [06:34] ready to continue moving forward instead [06:36] of getting into that relaxed position [06:38] that you saw [06:39] with ducky and spock so again same thing [06:41] i'd bring her down into position [06:43] simply turn my hand see how she like [06:45] keeps her paw up so she's a little bit [06:47] different than the other ones but still [06:49] the exact same concept now with her i [06:52] was able to do [06:52] just the lure but just like with ducky [06:55] if you need to you can pet them [06:57] and just get them comfortable in that [06:59] down position where you're doing like a [07:00] belly rub or something like that [07:02] but you can see how she is a little bit [07:03] different than those two [07:05] and again we would add the command she [07:07] doesn't know it yet because i just [07:08] started this with her the other day [07:09] bang bang and then we would do the q [07:12] free [07:12] and then reward bang bang [07:16] free very nice bang bang [07:20] and you see how she's ready to jump up [07:21] the moment i give her the reward [07:23] and that's why i like to use the [07:24] terminal marker bang bang [07:27] and if i wanted to get her to stay in [07:28] that position then i would use my [07:30] continuation marker yes [07:33] yes and i'd reward a bunch yes one right [07:36] after the other [07:37] yes so she's not likely to jump up right [07:39] away yes [07:40] you may have to do that if you have a [07:42] dog that jumps up yes [07:43] instantly after getting them into that [07:45] side position [07:46] free so keep that in mind now i'm going [07:49] to show you the last one [07:50] charlie he was the most difficult with [07:52] this one so now we have [07:54] charlie and like i said even though he's [07:55] so motivated he was [07:57] definitely more difficult than the other [07:58] dogs i i still don't even think he fully [08:00] follows the lure [08:01] see he doesn't even really follow the [08:03] lure [08:04] and so what i had to do with him and [08:07] this works since [08:09] he's so happy go lucky everybody down [08:12] and get a lot of drool on yourself [08:16] but with him what i had to do was i had [08:17] to pet him and then [08:19] almost so for those of you that do jiu [08:21] jitsu it's like a basic sweep [08:23] so what i had to do is just rotate a [08:25] little bit and then once he flops to the [08:27] side [08:27] free good very nice [08:31] so this one is using a little bit more [08:33] force because without it he [08:36] simply wouldn't do it so you have to [08:37] adjust according to the dog [08:39] down good so again i [08:42] take my left hand and i use it on his [08:44] arm over here pulling inwards [08:46] and then i push his shoulder just a [08:47] little bit just enough to get him to [08:49] comply [08:50] once he complies three good [08:55] and the more you do it the more your [08:56] dog's going to understand that [08:58] the final position that gets the reward [09:00] is when you mark [09:02] so again very nice it shouldn't be very [09:04] hard [09:05] see he's resisting a little bit he's my [09:08] he's my goofy [09:09] goofy dog there we go hold him in [09:12] position [09:15] free good and i've taught dogs this [09:18] trick [09:19] by doing it this way because they simply [09:21] would not follow the lure [09:22] so the lure is not going to work on [09:24] every single dog [09:26] good boy good [09:29] good very nice buddy and again a little [09:32] bit of pressure [09:33] rotate rotate rotate and [09:37] free good job [09:41] so i wouldn't add the command just yet [09:43] with charlie i didn't want to work with [09:44] him too much because i wanted you guys [09:46] to see [09:47] how he got spit all over your face i [09:49] wanted you guys to be able to see that [09:50] not every dog is going to be as easy [09:52] or as compliant as ari spock or jet was [09:56] and it's not that he's not compliant he [09:58] just doesn't understand [10:00] the turn see how he just wants to he [10:03] won't turn his body [10:05] so using the lure just will not work [10:08] with him [10:09] until i get him better understanding [10:11] that it's that position that's going to [10:12] get the reward [10:13] so again we bring him down this is the [10:15] last time so if i was adding the command [10:17] and i was doing this little sweeping [10:19] technique [10:20] i would say bang bang then i would do [10:22] the cue nice slow and easy [10:24] it's not a race once he flops on the [10:26] side [10:27] good oh [10:33] free good job buddy [10:37] all right so just keep that in mind if [10:41] you have a dog that doesn't follow the [10:43] lure as well you can still get them to [10:44] do it [10:45] if you are going to use a little bit of [10:46] force like i had to with charlie [10:48] just make sure you're staying happy or [10:50] staying excited and motivated because [10:52] our dogs feed off our energy if you [10:54] start getting frustrated because your [10:55] dog's not following the lure then your [10:57] dog is going to become worried and not [10:58] really know what they're supposed [11:00] to do but if you keep it fun and [11:01] light-hearted then you're gonna have a [11:02] good time your dog will have a good time [11:04] and you'll be able to get your dog to do [11:05] the cute little trick that so many [11:07] people like so you can impress your [11:09] friends [11:09] at the next party i hope you guys [11:11] enjoyed

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 176/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video i'm going to explain [00:01] and demonstrate how to teach your dog [00:03] not to jump up on people [00:04] this is a common issue that a lot of [00:05] people run into and it's much easier to [00:07] fix than you may think [00:08] number one you want to make sure your [00:10] dog understands the concept of leash [00:11] pressure [00:12] this is where they know to go with the [00:14] leash in order to turn off the pressure [00:16] it teaches them how to turn off pressure [00:17] by complying [00:18] but it also helps give our dog a very [00:20] clear direction of what we want and what [00:22] we expect from them [00:23] so this is exactly how i teach dogs not [00:25] to jump up on people [00:26] i'll have the dog and then i'm going to [00:27] let my friends know or whoever's coming [00:29] over [00:30] all right i'm working on teaching my dog [00:31] not to jump up so what i want you to do [00:33] is [00:34] pet my dog as long as all four paws are [00:36] on the ground [00:37] the moment my dog jumps up i want you to [00:39] stop petting [00:40] when all four paws are back on the [00:42] ground go back to petting [00:44] and what i'm going to do when my dog [00:45] jumps up is i'm going to apply the leash [00:47] pressure [00:48] once my dog's back on the ground i [00:49] instantly turn the pressure off [00:51] so we're going to be using three out of [00:53] the four quadrants of opera conditioning [00:54] that's your positive and negative [00:56] reinforcement positive and negative [00:57] punishment [00:58] so positive reinforcement we're petting [01:00] the dog when they're doing the behavior [01:01] correctly [01:02] the moment they jump up we remove the [01:04] reward so that's going to be negative [01:05] punishment taking away the reward [01:07] we turn on the leash pressure which is [01:09] negative reinforcement [01:10] once the dog's back in the correct [01:12] position we go back to rewarding [01:14] now we've already done this a couple [01:15] times and the dogs are a little bit [01:17] too well behaved and they're not jumping [01:19] up the way that we want them to [01:20] so we're going to make them jump up just [01:22] for demonstration purposes [01:24] so you guys can see exactly how it's [01:26] going to look when you're doing it with [01:27] your own dog [01:28] now keep in mind in order to get a dog [01:30] generalized to the training [01:31] you have to do this with multiple [01:33] different people until your dog realizes [01:35] that the rules [01:36] apply with everyone on average it's [01:38] usually eight or more people [01:40] so let's go ahead and get started all [01:42] right so my helper is going to come over [01:43] to say hi to ducky [01:44] she's going to start petting go ahead [01:46] and ped come here [01:50] and then stand up see if he'll try to [01:52] jump up at what are you doing [01:54] what are you doing not wrong okay do it [01:55] again what are you doing [01:57] wrong good pet again [02:02] try it again [02:05] wrong good [02:09] wrong good boy go ahead [02:13] wrong good so every time he jumps up i'm [02:16] saying wrong if i can [02:18] and then i'm applying leash pressure a [02:19] little bit more wrong [02:21] good good so what we're doing is [02:24] when he's doing what we want we're [02:26] applying positive reinforcement that's [02:27] the petting [02:28] boy and then when he jumps up we're [02:30] applying negative punishment which is [02:32] the removal of the reward [02:34] and then we go back to petting good boy [02:37] good [02:37] boy all right and you can do it as well [02:40] if you're the handler so [02:41] i can pet him good job buddy he's a good [02:43] boy very nice as long as he stays all [02:46] four paws on the ground [02:47] we can pet if he were to jump up just [02:49] like he did earlier [02:50] one wrong we apply the leash pressure [02:52] whatever word you choose [02:53] once all four paws are back on the [02:54] ground we go back to petty so i have one [02:56] more helper [02:57] and it's very normal for a dog to jump [02:59] up we want to make sure we're not [03:01] punishing them right away but rather [03:05] showing them what the expectations are [03:07] see if he'll jump up if you stand up [03:09] maybe talk to him a little bit [03:11] hey buddy come here so he's doing really [03:14] well [03:14] so then we would go back to petting him [03:16] as long as all four paws are on the [03:18] ground [03:20] excellent easy enough all right perfect [03:23] so [03:23] ducky figured it out very very quickly [03:26] and the key that you want to keep in [03:27] mind when you're doing this is [03:28] we're not trying to and if your dog has [03:30] a tendency to bite the leash you can [03:31] just pop the leash out of their mouth [03:33] but we want to make sure we're not [03:34] giving them any sort of punishment when [03:36] they're first learning this concept [03:38] we don't want them to be afraid or [03:39] worried when they meet new people we're [03:41] just trying to show them that jumping up [03:42] is not okay [03:43] so we're applying three out of the four [03:45] quadrants of opera conditioning [03:46] positive reinforcement that's the [03:48] petting when the dog jumps up and we [03:50] remove the reward [03:51] that's the negative punishment we're [03:53] taking away and then we're using the [03:54] leash pressure which is negative [03:56] reinforcement [03:57] we turn pressure on when they comply we [03:58] turn it off when you do this exercise [04:01] you want to make sure your dog [04:02] understands the concept of leash [04:04] pressure [04:04] going with the leash and following the [04:06] leash going into the desired positions [04:08] in order to turn off that pressure [04:10] if your dog doesn't know leash pressure [04:11] when you do this exercise it can still [04:13] work but it's not going to be as [04:14] effective [04:15] or as clear so make sure your dog knows [04:18] and understands the leash pressure [04:19] before doing this now if you want true [04:22] see if he bites it i just pop it out of [04:23] his mouth so this is a common thing [04:25] people run into as well [04:26] good i just simply pop it out of the [04:28] dog's mouth so they don't think it's [04:29] okay to bite and we take the enjoyment [04:31] or the fun [04:32] out of it by popping it out of their [04:33] mouth so [04:35] if you want full reliability on this [04:37] because some dogs even after you do this [04:38] they're still going to want to jump up [04:40] on people [04:41] if i get to the point where my dog jumps [04:43] up i say wrong and my dog comes off of [04:45] the person on their own [04:46] then that shows me that they know what [04:47] they're supposed to do we've given them [04:49] a very clear path to success [04:51] and they know how to turn off pressure [04:52] by complying so if i wanted to [04:54] transition it over [04:55] into an actual positive punishment i [04:57] would switch the negative reinforcement [04:59] to the positive punishment [05:00] that's going to give us our reliability [05:03] but i don't like to start that until the [05:04] dog actually knows what the rules and [05:06] expectations are [05:07] so the difference would be if i was [05:08] applying positive punishment is [05:10] they would come over they would pet him [05:12] if he jumps up they would stop petting i [05:14] would say no [05:15] pop the leash giving him a correction [05:17] all four paws are back on the ground [05:18] yay good puppy and that's going to help [05:21] give us that reliability because [05:22] remember everything our dogs do is based [05:24] on motivation [05:25] they're either motivated to access [05:26] something pleasant or they're motivated [05:28] to prevent something unpleasant [05:30] and we get to decide what the motivating [05:32] factors are that are presented to our [05:33] dogs that's going to influence [05:35] their behavior so you can have a nice [05:37] well-behaved pup that knows how to act [05:39] and behave [05:40] when they're meeting new people thanks [05:42] for watching guys and we'll see you in [05:43] the next one [05:44] hey

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 180/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we're going to be [00:01] teaching our dogs not to jump up on [00:03] furniture now if you want your dog to [00:04] jump up on furniture or you don't mind [00:06] having your dog [00:07] on the furniture that's completely fine [00:09] contrary to popular believe having your [00:11] dog on your furniture does not make them [00:13] think it's they're the alpha [00:14] i allow my dogs on the couch on the bed [00:16] it's fine [00:17] my good friend bethany who's a [00:19] phenomenal dog trainer i like the way [00:20] that she says that she says it's not a [00:22] problem unless it's a problem [00:23] so if you allow your dog on the couch [00:25] and then all of a sudden one day they [00:26] start resource guarding the couch [00:28] now it's an issue and you would want to [00:29] address that but if you're okay having [00:31] dogs on the furniture excellent [00:33] in this video we're going to be showing [00:34] them not to jump up on the furniture now [00:36] it's very simple [00:37] you want to make sure your dog knows [00:39] leash pressure this is going to be very [00:40] important [00:41] your dog understands to follow the leash [00:43] so if we lift up they know to follow it [00:45] if we pull forward they follow it [00:47] if we want to do pressure downwards [00:49] they'll follow it [00:50] they'll go with the pressure on the [00:51] leash this is very important [00:53] so what we're going to do is we're going [00:54] to walk up to the furniture when our dog [00:56] jumps up on the furniture [00:58] you can use a command you can say off if [01:00] you like but for this i'm going to say [01:01] the word [01:02] wrong wrong for the dogs that i train [01:05] predicts [01:05] leash pressure which is negative [01:07] reinforcement this is not a punishment [01:09] it's teaching our dog [01:10] what they need to do if we say the word [01:13] wrong [01:13] which is stop what you're doing or go [01:15] back into the previous position [01:17] so with ducky i'm going to walk over [01:19] here a little bit then i'm going to walk [01:20] towards the couch [01:21] wrong i apply leash pressure good boy [01:24] very nice [01:26] let's walk him back wrong apply the [01:28] pressure [01:29] so he's resisting a little bit good very [01:32] nice [01:33] we'll walk back wrong apply leash [01:35] pressure [01:38] and if he resists we just continue the [01:40] pressure until he complies [01:41] very good wrong will you apply leash [01:45] pressure [01:45] and you may have to do this a couple [01:46] times it's just like teaching to stay [01:48] wrong we're going to kill him again come [01:50] on sweetie very good [01:53] good job now you could reward your dog [01:55] when they're doing it correctly [01:56] i'm going to stand closer to the couch [01:58] often if we sit on the couch [02:00] the dog will want to jump up as well [02:03] good and he's not doing it so i'm going [02:04] to walk away [02:06] and back to the couch see if he's going [02:07] to jump on wrong we apply the pressure [02:10] good [02:10] very nice buddy very good [02:13] you can see he's already starting to [02:15] figure it out now he likes to run to the [02:17] couch to jump up on it [02:19] let's say you don't have the leash in [02:20] your hand wrong you could grab the [02:22] collar and guide them off [02:23] very good buddy we walk back excellent [02:27] nice job let's see if he's going to jump [02:29] up [02:30] very good so you can see in such a short [02:32] amount of time he's already learning [02:35] not to jump up on this couch and look at [02:36] him he's happy his tail's wagging [02:39] there's nothing confusing about what [02:40] we're doing remember dog training is all [02:42] about [02:43] clear communication letting our dogs [02:45] know when they're right or wrong [02:46] verbally [02:47] and giving them a very clear path to [02:49] success let's see if he's going to jump [02:50] up wrong [02:52] very good [02:56] very good nice job [03:01] excellent and i would continue to do [03:03] this up until the point where my dog [03:05] jumps up on the couch [03:06] i say wrong and they jump up jump off [03:09] on their own if you get to that point [03:11] then if you want full reliability [03:14] you could add positive punishment which [03:16] would be an actual correction [03:17] so if i was to add positive punishment [03:19] now i'm not going to do positive [03:21] punishment because he's such a good [03:22] well-behaved little puppy [03:24] and i don't like to add positive [03:25] punishment when i'm doing dog training [03:27] until the dog is a certain age and they [03:29] really know [03:30] and understand expectations but if i was [03:32] to add positive punishment the [03:34] difference would be instead of saying [03:35] wrong and applying leash pressure [03:36] saying off and applying leash pressure i [03:38] would say no when the dog jumps up i [03:40] would correct the dog [03:42] then i would tell them off and i would [03:43] cue them off the couch [03:45] anytime we add corrections in our dog [03:47] training we have to make sure the dog [03:48] knows what's expected of them and knows [03:50] how to turn off pressure by complying [03:52] then when we do add the corrections it's [03:54] one no one correction [03:56] re-command or command whatever we want [03:58] the dog to do so in this case [04:00] jump off the couch and then we assist [04:02] them so for example if i was correcting [04:04] a dog let's say [04:05] i told the dog to sit and the dog was [04:07] choosing not to sit [04:09] so like he's being a little bit of a [04:10] stinker right now but i'm just gonna [04:12] follow through [04:13] and he knows what the least pressure he [04:15] needs to sit good boy [04:16] so let's say i told him sitting he was [04:18] choosing not to i'd go no [04:19] correction sit and i would assist him i [04:22] would help him do the behavior [04:24] you never want to continue to correct a [04:26] dog for the same mistake [04:27] over and over again because some dogs [04:29] when you first start adding corrections [04:31] it could throw them off a little bit [04:32] they say wait we had a certain [04:33] arrangement [04:34] if i make a mistake you show me what to [04:36] do then we go back into our normal [04:38] routine [04:39] what is this correction stuff so we want [04:41] to be as fair as possible to our dogs we [04:43] wouldn't want to keep correcting meaning [04:44] i wouldn't tell a dog sit they don't sit [04:47] no correction sit no correction sit no [04:49] correction i wouldn't do that that would [04:51] create a lot of stress for a dog [04:53] so i'm going to demonstrate as if i was [04:55] using a correction so we'd walk him over [04:56] let's see i'm gonna make him jump up [04:58] come on buddy [04:58] i would say no i would pop the leash off [05:01] then i would cue him off [05:03] good boy and that would help give us the [05:05] reliability [05:06] for the dog not to do the undesired [05:08] behavior of jumping up [05:10] on specific furniture now if you have [05:12] certain furniture that your dog is [05:14] allowed to jump on and furniture that [05:15] your dog is not allowed to jump on [05:17] that's completely okay just make sure [05:19] you reinforce the ones that they're not [05:20] allowed to jump on [05:21] and the ones that they are allowed to [05:23] jump on you allow them to do that [05:25] don't allow it one day and then correct [05:26] them the next day that's how you can [05:28] create [05:28] a confused dog so now we're gonna do the [05:30] same thing with the bed [05:32] we got little ducky here and we're gonna [05:33] see if he's gonna jump up on the bed so [05:35] we're gonna walk this way [05:36] walk around come on come here [05:40] come on good boy wrong apply the [05:42] pressure good boy [05:44] good boy wrong very good [05:48] nice job nice job stevie's [05:52] going to want to jump up because i'm up [05:53] here are you a good boy [05:55] wrong and then we guide him off very [05:59] nice [06:00] very good oh excellent and then letting [06:03] him know he's doing it correctly [06:06] good job buddy i'm going to sit back up [06:08] wrong apply the leash pressure [06:11] well if you resist you just continue the [06:12] pressure until he complies [06:15] good boy very good [06:19] excellent nice work good boy [06:22] as you can see it's a very simple [06:24] process show the dog what's expected of [06:26] them communicate clearly by using that [06:28] leash pressure and when they're doing it [06:30] correctly we praise [06:31] and reward i hope you guys enjoyed [06:33] today's video let me know you think [06:34] about in the comments below and i will [06:36] see you guys in the next one [06:37] thanks again

The more techniques you have to choose from, the greater your chances of success. Dog training by Kikopup has an interesting series on this same subject and not to mention Zak George's Dog Training Revolution has an episode as well on this. In regard to the science part, keep in mind that when you are training your dog the science is always the same; what varies between each dog are things like motivation, perseverance, intelligence, temperament, disposition, etc. Being able to adjust for each dog’s specific needs is considered the art of dog training. Because of this, not all techniques work on all dogs; and as a result, you have to be able to adjust accordingly. For example, a dog with a very high level of perseverance will continue to work through a difficult task to get a reward—while other dogs may give up early. We can also use this to stop specific behavioral issues such as chewing on the furniture or playing too rough with another dog. We follow the same idea of saying “Wrong” then applying the pressure, and releasing the pressure when the dog does what we wish."

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 184/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we are going to be [00:01] teaching our dogs barriers or invisible [00:03] barriers within the house [00:05] anytime you have anything like a doorway [00:07] could be a barrier [00:08] or a step something that's a clear [00:10] indicator that if they pass it [00:12] we can reinforce the rules for that [00:14] location so what we're going to be doing [00:16] is we're going to be showing the dogs [00:17] right now that they cannot go into the [00:19] living room [00:19] unless invited this is an excellent [00:21] exercise if you don't want your dog [00:23] going into certain rooms within the [00:24] house [00:25] or maybe you have a newborn child on the [00:27] way i recommend not allowing your dog to [00:29] go [00:30] into the baby's room or the nursery so [00:32] we can use this invisible barrier [00:33] concept to teach them [00:35] where they can and can't go inside the [00:37] house without always having to put up [00:39] puppy gates so all i'm going to do is [00:41] i'm going to start to walk towards this [00:43] doorway [00:44] the moment ducky goes through the [00:46] doorway or jet [00:47] goes through the doorway i'm going to [00:48] say one wrong [00:50] i'm going to apply the leash pressure [00:52] once he's in the correct spot [00:53] i'm going to turn off the pressure i'm [00:55] also going to be using the continuation [00:57] marker for him i'm just going to use [00:59] verbal praise so when he's maintaining [01:01] the position i'm going to let him know [01:02] good boy [01:03] and i'm going to give him rewards when [01:04] he's doing it correctly also keep in [01:06] mind that a [01:07] wrong can override a good boy or a yes [01:09] whatever your marker is [01:11] meaning if you tell him yes or you tell [01:13] your dog yes and you're going to give [01:14] them a reward [01:15] and they do the opposite of what you [01:18] want them to do so in this situation [01:19] going through the barrier [01:21] i'm not going to give him a reward for [01:22] that because then i'm going to be [01:23] rewarding the incorrect behavior so [01:25] again [01:27] a wrong or a no can override a yes [01:30] so i'm going to take ducky break good [01:32] boy and we're just going to walk [01:33] and once he walks through it wrong and [01:36] i'm going to bring him back [01:37] good wrong and bring him back [01:40] good very good wrong [01:43] bring him back excellent [01:47] good and if he holds the position good [01:50] boy [01:50] i can reward him wrong [01:55] good excellent [01:58] good job [02:01] very good so you can see he's already [02:04] getting it very quickly and i have not [02:05] done this exercise with him [02:07] when you teach your dog these [02:08] communication channels such as the [02:10] markers [02:11] and the sound that predicts negative [02:13] reinforcement for ducky that's the word [02:15] wrong [02:15] or no predicting a correction it makes [02:18] it much easier [02:19] for us to tell our dogs what we want [02:20] them to do and give them really clear [02:23] expectations [02:24] wrong so i bring them back i can just [02:27] use my body at that point [02:29] wrong good [02:32] or i could have used the leash pressure [02:34] now if the barrier is really big like [02:36] this doorway is kind of big this may be [02:37] difficult for some dogs [02:39] you could put something across the [02:40] bottom maybe a little piece of wood [02:42] just to help show the dog that there is [02:44] a barrier but he's getting this pretty [02:46] quickly [02:47] and i'm wrong and if he breaks it we [02:50] simply bring him back good boy [02:54] wrong good and we're treating it [02:57] the exact same way we would be treating [02:59] the stick wrong [03:01] the stay command so we when we put a dog [03:04] in a state position [03:05] as long as they maintain the position we [03:07] can reward them [03:09] and if they break the position we say [03:11] the one wrong and we reinforce [03:12] expectations and so wrong [03:16] so you see he broke the barrier and he [03:19] just went into a down [03:20] we bring him back good [03:24] very good nice job excellent work [03:28] wrong good remember a wrong can override [03:33] a good boy or a yes now he's doing it [03:35] correctly [03:36] also you don't want to reward your dog [03:38] the moment you put them back [03:40] if they break the position meaning they [03:42] break the position you say wrong you put [03:44] them back and you give them a reward [03:46] you would not want to do that because [03:47] some dogs will actually offer up the [03:49] mistake [03:50] in order to be reinforced to get the [03:53] treat so if they do break the position [03:55] or they go through the barrier [03:56] and i have to put them back i make sure [03:58] i wait a couple seconds [03:59] before i give them another reward so [04:02] then it's holding [04:03] and maintaining the position is why [04:05] they're getting the reward [04:06] and not for breaking the position and [04:08] being put back into the position [04:11] very nice so you can see he's already [04:13] holding it well [04:14] now we're going to walk this way and [04:15] look at he's following me because he [04:17] knows that he can follow me in this [04:18] direction [04:21] wrong good [04:24] very good buddy wrong excellent [04:29] and you're gonna see i'm gonna walk by [04:30] and watch him follow excellent nice job [04:33] and we're gonna see if he'll stop at the [04:34] barrier on his own [04:36] wrong he almost did [04:43] look how quick he's already figuring it [04:45] out because of clear communication [04:47] let's bring another dog out and do the [04:49] same exercise now spock [04:51] his continuation marker is yes quick [04:54] reminder [04:54] continuation marker just predicts a [04:57] reward [04:57] that's it so if your dog is in a stay [05:00] position [05:00] then it reinforces the stay so he's [05:02] offering up the play dead trick [05:04] so if they're in a state position and [05:06] you say yes [05:07] it just means they're going to get a [05:09] reward it doesn't release them from the [05:11] position [05:11] but if your dog is not in a commanded [05:13] stay and you say yes [05:15] it doesn't make it a stay again it just [05:18] means they're going to be getting a [05:19] reward [05:20] the difference between that and the [05:21] terminal marker the terminal marker [05:23] predicts [05:24] release and reward but if the dog is not [05:27] in a stay [05:28] then it's not really releasing them from [05:29] anything so [05:31] it's important if we're not trying to [05:32] get a dog to maintain a position [05:34] and we're trying to do a lot of [05:35] repetition so this is when we're first [05:37] teaching a command such as sit or down [05:38] then we can use a terminal marker which [05:40] will increase the speed [05:42] so the dog will learn the faster i do [05:43] the behavior the faster i get to jump up [05:45] and get the reward [05:46] in this situation we're going to use the [05:47] continuation marker because if i were to [05:49] use the terminal marker [05:50] i would be telling him he's released he [05:52] can come and get his reward from me [05:54] which is the opposite of what we want we [05:56] want to show him that he cannot cross [05:58] this barrier [05:58] unless we invite him on to the other [06:00] side so come on buddy [06:02] good boy so just getting him to stand up [06:04] see if he's going to follow me [06:06] and i'm going to set the leash down when [06:07] he goes through wrong [06:09] one wrong and i bring him back very good [06:13] wrong we could even just use our hand [06:16] excellent [06:17] so i'm doing the exact same exercise [06:19] that i just did with jet [06:20] when he's holding the position we can [06:22] reinforce by saying yes [06:24] and going back and rewarding instead of [06:26] doing this and this is something very [06:28] common that a lot of people do [06:30] stay stay [06:35] stay i don't know about you guys but i [06:37] don't want to do this [06:40] every time i want my dog to stay in a [06:42] certain position or maintain a position [06:44] or not cross a barrier i'd rather act [06:47] normal [06:47] so i show them the picture of what it's [06:49] going to look like if i were to walk in [06:51] here [06:51] and i want him to stay let's say you [06:53] don't want your dog in the dining room [06:54] because that's where the family eats and [06:56] you don't want the dog sitting at your [06:57] feet [06:58] you could teach them the same concept by [07:00] using some sort of some sort of barrier [07:02] so he's doing a nice job i can reinforce [07:04] by saying yes come back and give him the [07:06] reward [07:08] another thing is i've had people ask me [07:10] do you teach your dog a weight command [07:12] and i say no i don't teach my dog a [07:14] weight command they're like well how do [07:15] i get my dog to wait if i want my dog to [07:17] wait [07:17] and then i say what would you like your [07:19] dog to do while your dog is waiting [07:21] and they go oh i'd like my dog to lay [07:23] down okay tell your dog to down [07:25] now your dog's in a down stay and you're [07:26] telling them exactly what to do instead [07:28] of trying to add a new command [07:30] such as the word weight all right so [07:33] spock is doing really well so i'm going [07:35] to walk back this way [07:37] excellent and i'm going to walk through [07:39] see if he wrong [07:41] so one wrong and again we reinforce the [07:44] barrier good boy [07:47] excellent and you see how he's already [07:49] starting to realize that this [07:51] wrong i don't want him to get that treat [07:54] going through the barrier [07:56] but you can see he's already starting to [07:58] realize that i don't want him passing [08:00] this position now we really want to test [08:02] the dog out something i like to do as [08:04] well is i'll squat down because that [08:05] will sometimes get a dog to want to come [08:07] to us [08:09] yes and if he does a nice job we can [08:11] mark reward and come back [08:13] or mark come back and reward [08:16] yes excellent nice job [08:20] good boy so we're going to see if he can [08:22] stop [08:23] at the barrier [08:29] yes very good now he's stopping a little [08:32] early [08:34] and again neither of these dogs have [08:36] been trained on this exercise [08:38] so something that's commonly uh left as [08:41] a comment on my videos is oh how come [08:43] why don't you do it with a dog that [08:44] doesn't know the exercise already [08:46] these dogs don't know this exercise but [08:48] it may look like they do because i've [08:49] taught them their markers i've taught [08:51] them the concept of leash pressure [08:52] i've worked commands with them so we [08:54] have a very great relationship [08:57] and i'm able to communicate with them [08:59] very clearly [09:00] of what i want and so they're able to [09:02] figure it out quite fast [09:04] now collies are very smart dogs as well [09:06] so now we're going to bring one more [09:07] we're going to bring my dog arie [09:09] she doesn't know this exercise either [09:11] but you're going to see how fast she's [09:12] going to learn it [09:13] because she knows her markers as well as [09:16] leash pressure so let's grab her [09:17] now we have my dog ari i'm going to give [09:19] her a reward [09:20] and again she doesn't know this exercise [09:22] either once she walks through the [09:23] barrier i'm gonna do exactly what i did [09:25] with the other two puppies [09:27] wrong good [09:31] wrong good [09:34] yes wrong so remember [09:37] ron can override it yes there we go [09:42] and just that quickly because she [09:44] already knows [09:46] normal obedience and how i like to [09:48] communicate [09:50] she's already figuring it out she can [09:51] already tell that's a barrier [09:53] i'm going to have her walk back this way [09:54] and see if she's going to follow me [09:57] wrong [10:02] very good ari good girl [10:05] if i'm going to use my continuation [10:07] marker it's good to get into the habit [10:10] it's good to get into the habit of [10:11] saying yes then going [10:13] and rewarding your dog a common mistake [10:16] that people make [10:18] is when they're getting ready to reward [10:19] their dog they'll do this [10:21] yes as they're walking towards the dog [10:25] think of it like changing lanes when [10:27] you're driving you're driving [10:28] you signal then you change so with this [10:32] we mark [10:33] then we go to reward so if i'm walking [10:35] this way and i'm watching her and she's [10:36] doing it correctly [10:37] yes then i can go back and i can reward [10:40] her [10:41] also very important you have to watch [10:44] your dog while doing this exercise [10:46] you can't turn around and then turn back [10:49] and your dog has already gone through [10:51] the barrier [10:52] and then say wrong because at that point [10:54] it's been [10:55] too long and it's not going to be clear [10:57] to your dog you have to say the word [10:59] wrong or whatever word you choose [11:01] within the first second of your dog [11:03] breaking the barrier so [11:04] one mississippi boom that's how much [11:06] time you have in order to say [11:08] the wrong or again no or uh doesn't [11:11] matter pick a word [11:12] as long as you're consistent with that [11:13] word predicting least pressure or [11:15] reinforcing [11:16] what we want so i'm gonna squat down [11:18] with her as well [11:19] wrong and then i'm gonna get her to go [11:21] back good [11:26] yes [11:33] yes very good ari [11:37] excellent work and let's see if she'll [11:39] walk through the barrier [11:40] wrong wrong [11:51] wrong good very good [11:56] and one more time [12:02] free and if you want to allow them to [12:05] come into the room you can use your [12:06] terminal marker and have them come get [12:08] the reward [12:08] or you can use your release word like [12:10] break and allow them [12:12] into the room if you want them to know [12:14] it's okay that they can go in [12:16] but if you want them to never go in the [12:18] room just always reinforce it and never [12:20] let them cross the barrier [12:22] and they'll even choose not to cross the [12:24] barrier even if you're not home [12:25] if you're consistent with the training i [12:27] hope everybody enjoyed today's video of [12:29] course as always let me know you think [12:30] about it in the comments below please

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 186/841,"com/ In regard to the science part, keep in mind that when you are training your dog the science is always the same; what varies between each dog are things like motivation, perseverance, intelligence, temperament, disposition, etc. Being able to adjust for each dog’s specific needs is considered the art of dog training. Because of this, not all techniques work on all dogs; and as a result, you have to be able to adjust accordingly. For example, a dog with a very high level of perseverance will continue to work through a difficult task to get a reward—while other dogs may give up early. ►► Just like me, I know your dogs are the most important thing to you — so having them insured is a no-brainer!

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 188/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back everyone to another episode [00:02] today we are introducing our dogs to the [00:04] tracking box [00:05] i learned the tracking box at the tom [00:07] rose school for those of you who are not [00:09] familiar with that is it is a school [00:10] that i went to to become a certified [00:12] professional [00:13] and master dog trainer stick around to [00:15] the end of the video today because tom [00:17] rose himself [00:18] watched the video critiqued it and added [00:20] a couple notes that i think is going to [00:22] be [00:22] incredibly valuable for those of you [00:24] that want to become [00:26] exceptional trackers let's get started [00:28] today we're going to be teaching our [00:30] dogs what's known as a tracking box this [00:32] is something that [00:33] tom rose teaches at his school for [00:34] professional dog trainers [00:36] in fact it was a student that came up [00:37] with a concept and it was so effective [00:39] with the dogs [00:40] that he continued to teach at every [00:41] class after that what we're going to be [00:44] doing is we're going to be jumping [00:45] into a location and we're going to put [00:48] the flags down this is going to help us [00:49] indicate where the box is now when [00:52] you're making this box it should be [00:53] about one and a half times the size of [00:55] your dog [00:56] so if your dog is in length let's say [00:59] two and a half feet [01:00] then you want to make it roughly three [01:02] and a half feet give or take so what i'm [01:04] gonna do is i'm gonna jump into the [01:05] location [01:06] and then i'm gonna put the flags down [01:08] and i'm gonna lay food inside of that [01:10] square [01:10] where i step on the grass this is going [01:12] to show our dogs that [01:14] they're going to be able to find reward [01:15] where there's crushed vegetation [01:17] and the smell of the human whatever odor [01:19] we leave behind [01:21] so i'm going to demonstrate as i do this [01:23] so you want to make sure you jump in so [01:25] you don't affect [01:26] any of the grass around the tracking box [01:28] so i jump in right there [01:30] good excellent and then i'm going to [01:33] take a flag and i'm going to put it in [01:35] one corner [01:38] and i'm going to stomp [01:42] and make the next corner [01:50] it doesn't have to be a perfect square [01:59] and then we want to step every location [02:03] inside of the tracking box [02:07] once we complete that we're going to [02:09] take our dog's food [02:10] or treats whatever it is that we're [02:12] using [02:14] and we're going to fill the bot the [02:15] tracking box with the food now when you [02:16] do this you have to make sure [02:18] that the food doesn't leave the tracking [02:21] box it has to stay on the inside [02:23] the dog has to make a connection with [02:24] the crushed vegetation and the smell [02:26] that we leave behind [02:28] when we're stepping and the food so no [02:31] food [02:31] where we did not step food where we [02:33] stepped so i get nice and low and i set [02:35] the food in and i make sure it's [02:37] in the location where i was stepping [02:42] and doing our best not to step outside [02:45] of the box [03:00] okay once you've completed that you want [03:01] to jump back out of the box [03:05] and then you're going to bring your dog [03:06] now if it's the first time you're doing [03:08] this and it's a small dog that you could [03:09] pick up and hold [03:10] then you'll take the dog and actually [03:12] step in with them set the dog down and [03:14] allow them to start searching for the [03:16] food [03:17] now since i'm doing this with my dog ari [03:19] she's a little bit bigger and it'd be [03:20] harder for me to carry her in [03:22] so i'm just going to let her walk inside [03:24] and start working [03:25] on her own and you're going to notice [03:27] when she leaves the tracking box [03:28] she'll notice that there is a change in [03:30] the smell and there's [03:32] no longer any rewards and that's going [03:33] to get her to turn back [03:35] and go back into the tracking box to [03:37] continue searching for the rewards [03:39] and you would want to continue doing the [03:40] tracking box up into a point where you [03:42] bring your dog out [03:43] and they see those flags and they [03:45] already know what's going on and they go [03:46] to the flag and they start working [03:48] within that tracking box [03:49] that would lead us to our next step when [03:51] we start doing straight lines [03:53] so let's grab ari and get her inside of [03:55] the box now we have ari and i'm going to [03:57] allow her to go into the tracking box [03:59] and start working come on [04:00] i'm gonna send her in there she goes [04:04] now she's starting to notice that [04:05] there's food so i'm using a flexi line [04:08] because i want her to pull towards the [04:10] actual tracking box [04:12] in order to start searching for the food [04:14] we're going to see how she does with [04:15] this [04:25] and i've only done a tracking box with [04:27] her one time when she was a puppy [04:30] and i haven't done it since then so this [04:32] is the first time as an adult dog [04:34] that she's done the tracking box i like [04:37] to keep the dog either on a harness or [04:38] an agitation collar [04:40] giving them the opportunity to pull in [04:42] order to get the rewards [04:47] and again the main idea behind this [04:49] exercise is that your dog learns that [04:51] they can find rewards where the odor is [04:54] different because of that crushed [04:55] vegetation [04:56] and the odor that we leave behind from [04:58] stepping in that area [05:00] and that's going to help when we [05:01] transfer them to the actual tracks that [05:03] we're going to be doing [05:07] now a lot of dogs will stand up and [05:08] search ari is a little bit unique and [05:10] she likes to lay down apparently while [05:12] she's searching [05:14] but that's fine [05:18] and this tracking box is actually a [05:19] little bit too small so now she's [05:21] leaving the box [05:22] notice she came back and that's what we [05:24] want to see she left the box [05:27] she noticed that the odor was different [05:29] and there was no longer any rewards [05:31] and that's what got her to turn right [05:33] back around into the tracking box and [05:35] again that is the idea [05:36] of this exercise [05:44] so now she's left the box again [05:47] no food and she goes back [06:00] good job [06:03] as you can see this is a very simple [06:05] exercise like i said if you're starting [06:06] with a young puppy [06:07] then step into the tracking box with [06:09] them and set them down and kind of help [06:11] them out a little bit [06:12] and as they become more confident in the [06:14] exercise and they get to the point where [06:15] they're [06:15] they're seeing the flags and they know [06:17] what's going on and they're pulling and [06:18] trying to get to the tracking box [06:20] then you could do how i did with re [06:22] where you're outside of the tracking box [06:24] and as your dog gets even better you can [06:26] start adding a little bit of [06:27] tension on the harness because when [06:29] they're tracking we want them to pull [06:31] and lead us through the track depending [06:34] on which sport you're doing so if you're [06:36] doing it for [06:37] igp shits in or akc tracking [06:40] just make sure you double check the [06:41] rules and that you're following the [06:43] proper procedures [06:44] that they have lined out in the rulebook [06:46] so that's going to be very important [06:48] each one's going to be slightly [06:49] different so again if you're competing [06:51] just make sure you're following the [06:52] rules [06:52] of that specific sport so i hope this [06:55] video helps you guys out those that are [06:56] interested in tracking [06:57] let me know you think about it in the [06:58] comments below and i'll see you guys in [07:00] the next one thanks again [07:04] nathan's explanation of the tracking is [07:07] very good and accurate [07:08] a few minor things i might like to point [07:10] out before we [07:12] start a puppy or even a grown dog on the [07:15] tracking box [07:16] we teach what is called a finger point [07:19] it's described in my book [07:21] training dogs with the touch what this [07:23] amounts to [07:24] is if i point in a direction the dog [07:27] needs to [07:28] learn that i'm pointing and he needs to [07:31] follow that point [07:32] and if he does he'll get a piece of food [07:36] so we generally do that for a few days [07:38] before starting on the tracking box [07:41] next step with the tracking box is to [07:44] place [07:45] food on the tracking box as [07:48] nathan mentioned however if you use [07:51] small kibble it's going to fall inside [07:54] the grass and be very difficult for the [07:56] dog to dig out [07:57] instead we recommend using hot dogs [08:00] cut up into nickel-sized pieces that way [08:03] we can use the finger point [08:05] to point out the food and get the puppy [08:07] started [08:08] and once it dog begins to understand [08:11] what he's looking for and that there is [08:13] food in there he can [08:15] visually find the food and then [08:18] as he works the ball for the box further [08:21] this food will fall between the grass [08:23] and he's going to have to use his nose [08:26] also we begin standing [08:29] inside the box with the dog as opposed [08:32] to sending the dog [08:33] from a lease length away from the box [08:36] to go on and start working if we're [08:39] inside [08:40] the box especially with a puppy we carry [08:42] the puppy in [08:44] and then we can point out the food [08:47] much more easily plus the dog is [08:51] more likely to stay with us than he [08:53] would be if we were standing outside the [08:55] box [08:56] and he wanted to come to us so we can [08:59] make sure that all the food is picked up [09:01] and if he quits early rather than [09:04] pulling out of the box [09:05] we can pick him up and carry him out of [09:07] the box wait a little bit [09:09] and start again later there are several [09:12] steps [09:13] first is we are inside the box with the [09:16] dog [09:17] next step is we are outside as nathan [09:20] demonstrated with the dog [09:22] the next step is we try to pull the dog [09:24] from the track [09:26] we call this proofing we want the dog to [09:29] pull against [09:29] us and resist being pulled out we would [09:32] never pull him out actually [09:34] but we begin with a slight tug on the [09:37] leash [09:37] and the dog fighting to go back into the [09:40] track [09:42] as he gets stronger and stronger with [09:44] his will [09:46] to not submit to the pressures of the [09:49] lead [09:50] at that point he is ready [09:53] to begin a straight line track and on [09:56] the track [09:57] straight line track we're going to do [09:59] exactly the same thing [10:00] if he wanders off to the right for [10:02] instance we'll pull him to the right [10:04] he'll realize that we're don't know what [10:06] we're doing we're pulling the wrong way [10:08] and he will generally respond with an [10:11] equal and opposite pressure [10:13] taking him back to the track he finds [10:15] food and he continues [10:17] this teaches the dog to disregard the [10:19] handler when he's doing the track [10:21] which is very important as we move into [10:24] advanced tracking [10:26] the tracking box is a very powerful tool [10:29] kind of interesting [10:30] that when students come out to the ranch [10:32] to do tracking [10:34] when they're done and they leave and i'm [10:36] getting ready to leave myself [10:39] my dog is turned loose to go potty and [10:42] he will [10:42] run to where the students had been [10:44] working with their dogs [10:46] and try to find pet tracking boxes i [10:49] then have to wait for him to [10:51] eat all the food that was left over out [10:53] of the boxes [10:54] before i can leave very excited about it [10:58] and needless to say he becomes a very [11:01] good tracker [11:02] from this sort of a beginning and it's a [11:05] very positive motivated [11:12] discipline [11:23] you ================================================== CONTENU DE:

Video 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeVWMcwbf1w&t=16s Step two: Say your command and have the decoy/helper come out to tease your dog with the toy. Step three: Practice this in multiple environments to help your dog become generalized to the training. In regard to the science part, keep in mind that when you are training your dog the science is always the same; what varies between each dog are things like motivation, perseverance, intelligence, temperament, disposition, etc. Being able to adjust for each dog’s specific needs is considered the art of dog training. Because of this, not all techniques work on all dogs; and as a result, you have to be able to adjust accordingly. For example, a dog with a very high level of perseverance will continue to work through a difficult task to get a reward—while other dogs may give up early. ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ ►► Nate Schoemer Shop👕: https://nateschoemershop.com/ ►► Get a copy of my dog training manual📚: https://amzn.to/2P2tyQH ►► Join My Facebook Group☕️: https://www.facebook.com/groups/NateSchoemers ►► Support Through Patreon🦮: https://www.patreon."

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 192/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we are going to be [00:01] teaching our dogs a deterrent [00:03] so if you're taking your dog out on a [00:04] walk and maybe you don't feel very [00:06] comfortable [00:06] in that neighborhood or wherever you are [00:09] and you want to be able to give your dog [00:10] an alert command [00:11] let's say you think somebody's following [00:13] you and you're feeling nervous or [00:14] uncomfortable about that [00:15] you can give your dog a command that [00:17] will make them act and appear to be [00:19] aggressive even though they're not and [00:21] this is going to be a deterrent it's not [00:23] teaching our dog how to bite [00:24] it's not teaching our dog how to be [00:26] aggressive it's just teaching them to [00:27] act a very specific way [00:29] if we give them a command whether we use [00:32] the command [00:33] alert or we can say something like easy [00:35] it doesn't really matter as long as you [00:37] have a word that's going to let your dog [00:38] know [00:39] to act in an aggressive manner even [00:41] though it's not [00:42] actual aggression let's get started okay [00:45] so if it's your dog you're going to be [00:46] the one holding the leash but for this [00:48] example since i'm going to be doing the [00:50] training [00:50] i'm going to have my friend rachel [00:52] holding the leash for me so there's a [00:53] couple ways you can do it some people [00:55] will keep it behind their back [00:57] they'll hold it on one side so they have [00:58] it on their hips on each side [01:00] and they'll stand staggered so it gives [01:02] them stability to support and maintain [01:04] the position [01:05] you want to try to be like a tree you [01:06] want to keep the dog in one position [01:09] as much as possible now of course when [01:10] the dog's pulling you might move a [01:11] little bit [01:12] but the idea is you want to stay as [01:14] stationary as possible [01:16] so rachel's going to hold ari the first [01:18] thing i want to do is i want to get ari [01:20] excited i want to get her barking in [01:21] order to get the toy [01:22] now i've done this training with her [01:24] before so she's going to start barking [01:25] right away [01:26] your first step i also talk about this [01:28] in my how to teach your dog to bark [01:30] video [01:30] we're going to tease her with a toy when [01:32] she gets excited i'm going to reward her [01:34] with the toy [01:35] i'm going to play with her for a moment [01:36] we're going to out we're going to do [01:37] that a couple times and then we're going [01:38] to move on to the next step [01:40] okay so we have rachel she's gonna come [01:43] over here [01:44] and hold the leash like i said as tight [01:46] as you can you could have one on one [01:48] side one on the other [01:49] and ari's gonna be pulling i'm gonna [01:51] present the toy you're gonna see she's [01:52] gonna start barking and she's going to [01:53] get very excited [01:54] and then i'm going to reward her for [01:56] that behavior you might have to tease [01:57] your dog quite a bit in order to get [01:59] them to bark [02:00] but this is going to be the basic idea [02:02] so i show her the toy [02:05] she barks i move towards it boom i move [02:09] i move i move [02:12] good and then i reward her with the toy [02:14] now i'm gonna play with her with the tug [02:16] for a minute [02:17] good girl very nice very good [02:20] excellent good [02:23] good job and you can slip it and let her [02:26] have it [02:27] kind of do a little victory lap if we [02:28] wanted to but we're not worried about [02:29] that right now [02:30] all right out no out good [02:34] so that's going to be the physical cue [02:36] that's going to get our dog to act [02:39] or what's going to appear to be [02:40] aggressive even though it's clearly play [02:43] because we're using a toy and we're [02:45] using our dog's prey drive [02:46] so now what we're going to do is we're [02:48] going to add the command the command [02:50] we're going to use for ari will be [02:52] easy so rachel's going to say easy [02:55] the moment after she says easy then i'm [02:58] going to present the toy so the command [03:00] is going to be [03:01] easy all right so whenever you're ready [03:05] easy boom now i present the toy i could [03:08] tease her a little bit [03:09] give her the bite boom we play tug [03:12] excellent work [03:13] ari giving her a reward because the toy [03:16] is more fun when they're actively [03:18] engaged with the human [03:19] than when they're by themselves at least [03:21] that's the way you want it to be [03:22] all right good girl ari out [03:26] nope good now the next step is going to [03:29] be [03:31] you'd want to bring your dog out and [03:32] you're going to have the other person [03:34] hiding around a corner [03:35] she's going to have to say the command [03:37] loud enough that i can hear it [03:39] when i hear it that's when i'm going to [03:41] pop out from [03:42] behind the corner of the wall so the [03:45] idea is [03:46] our dogs are going to think any time [03:48] they hear the word easy [03:50] someone's going to come out and play [03:51] with a toy and we're going to do it in [03:53] different locations [03:54] and present it in different scenarios so [03:56] our dog can become generalized to the [03:58] training [03:58] if you only do it in your backyard and [04:00] then you try to tell your dog easy when [04:01] you're walking around or whatever [04:02] command you choose [04:04] your dog's not going to act out that [04:05] behavior because your dog's not [04:06] generalized yet [04:08] so again step one we get them to bark [04:10] and do the behavior that we want step [04:12] two we introduce the command [04:14] step three we hide and we have our [04:16] person [04:17] say the command in order to cue us to [04:19] come out to do the [04:20] correct behavior to get our dog to act [04:22] the way we want them to [04:25] oh good [04:29] very good oh good [04:32] excellent very nice ari [04:35] good girl very good oh [04:39] excellent nice ari out [04:43] so i would continue to do this up until [04:45] the point where [04:46] the moment rachel says easy ari starts [04:49] barking and getting excited [04:52] before the person with the toy comes out [04:55] so now the next step is we're going to [04:57] walk down the street and i'm going to [04:58] let rachel know [05:00] where to say the alert command and then [05:02] i'm going to jump out [05:03] out of nowhere and do the exact same [05:05] thing we just did [05:07] we're going to do that in a couple [05:08] different locations so you want to do [05:10] this [05:11] i've talked about this in some of my [05:12] other videos to get a dog generalized [05:14] you usually want to do around eight or [05:16] more different locations so your dog [05:17] understands that no matter what the [05:19] situation is if you give this command [05:21] your dog is going to do the correct [05:23] behavior but we want to do it enough to [05:25] where [05:25] again they hear that command and they're [05:27] going where's the toy it's time to play [05:29] and they start barking which can be a [05:32] nice deterrent [05:33] if you feel uncomfortable in a situation [05:35] where you think there could be somebody [05:37] who could present a threat to you [05:38] this would help scare them off at least [05:40] that's the idea all right so let's do [05:41] the next step [05:46] oh good girl let her bark stay in spot [05:49] let her bark [05:50] good good girl [05:55] very good nice job [05:58] excellent good girl are ya [06:14] that's my good girl that's my good girl [06:18] let's get out and an attack good [06:22] ari out taco cheeseburger [06:26] attack and give her a win [06:29] excellent work if you're doing this type [06:32] of training again you have to do this in [06:33] multiple different environments [06:34] and the idea is you say the command and [06:36] your dog starts barking [06:38] looking for the toy that's going to come [06:39] out you don't want to let your dog [06:41] pull you to the toy you want your dog to [06:44] understand it's the barking [06:45] that brings the toy to your dog that's [06:48] what gives us that deterrent that we're [06:50] looking for easy [06:53] good girl good girl good girl [06:57] all right go ahead and reward her good [07:01] good job ari very nice [07:05] good and then go ahead and slip it let [07:07] her have it [07:08] alright excellent so if you guys noticed [07:11] on that last one [07:13] i said the command easy and she started [07:15] barking [07:16] before rachel came out and that's what [07:18] we want we want them doing the behavior [07:20] before the human with the toy comes out [07:23] and presents the toy to them [07:24] that's showing us that they know when [07:26] they hear the command easy [07:27] they think they're going to be playing a [07:29] game and they know that it's the barking [07:31] that brings the game to them which in [07:33] the end looks like a really nice [07:35] deterrent [07:36] to somebody who could potentially be a [07:38] bad guy i hope you guys enjoyed today's [07:40] video [07:40] as always like subscribe hit that [07:42] notification bell [07:43] and i will see you guys in the next one [07:59] you ==================================================

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 195/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another episode everyone [00:01] today i'm here in riverside california [00:04] at ph dogs with professional dog trainer [00:06] bethany perdome [00:07] she's going to be going over puppy [00:09] resource guarding how to evaluate it [00:12] and prevent it my name is bethany i am a [00:14] breeder of [00:15] working line belgian traverins and [00:17] malinois this is not how i usually feed [00:20] i'm just doing this for demonstration [00:21] purposes [00:24] i resources are only valuable if they're [00:27] limited [00:27] or if they find them really high value [00:29] so if i i generally keep my puppies kind [00:31] of fat and that way they don't fight [00:33] over food [00:34] i purposely didn't feed them as much [00:36] last night and they haven't had [00:37] breakfast this morning so you can see [00:39] what normal behavior is if they do find [00:41] food [00:42] super high value when they have to [00:44] compete for it [01:08] let me take her out but you can see now [01:10] that i took out the older german [01:11] shepherd puppy now everybody else is [01:12] willing to approach and eat [01:18] this is why it's very important for [01:20] working dogs to go home at eight weeks [01:23] and not wait till 12.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 196/841,[01:26] so this is the big girl that was being a [01:29] bully with all the other puppies [01:31] she's actually two weeks older than [01:32] everybody else so she just turned 10 [01:34] weeks [01:35] this is a good example of why i like to [01:37] send my puppies home at 8 weeks versus [01:39] waiting until 12 weeks [01:41] there's a program called puppy culture [01:42] and they recommend that all good [01:44] breeders will keep their puppies till 12 [01:45] weeks [01:46] with pets it's fine but with the working [01:47] dogs you can see that the aggression is [01:49] already coming out [01:50] and if she were to stay with the other [01:51] puppies until they were all 12 weeks [01:54] you could see that there would be some [01:54] serious issues with with resource [01:56] guarding for her [01:58] the other thing that happens is because [01:59] she's a little bit older than everybody [02:00] else [02:01] she would get a huge ego and think that [02:03] she's a giant monster because she's able [02:05] to [02:06] take control of the situation so [02:08] problems can occur like that where if i [02:10] placed her in a home and [02:11] they had another dog or she was the only [02:13] dog in the house then [02:14] the resource guarding is going to go [02:15] away very quickly because now she's at [02:17] the bottom of the totem pole where puppy [02:18] should be [02:19] but if she stayed with everybody else [02:20] the other puppies would continue to get [02:22] bullied and that can create insecurity [02:24] issues [02:24] and she's going to get a giant ego [02:26] because she's going to think that she's [02:27] a big [02:28] big bad girl so if i'm going to work on [02:31] resource guarding i get a brand new [02:32] puppy i'm not going to wait to find out [02:34] if i have an issue i'm going to start [02:35] treating it to prevent it from ever [02:37] being an issue [02:38] so what i have is i have some different [02:40] chew bones generally i don't like [02:42] rawhide i just grab this one because [02:43] it's big enough for me to take it from [02:44] my puppy [02:46] so they can be holding it here and i [02:47] have plenty of room to grab on without [02:48] getting my fingers bit [02:50] so i've got a little bully stick i've [02:52] got another chew bone i've got this [02:53] rawhide again i don't like rawhides [02:56] i've got an antler i generally don't [02:58] like these [02:59] two because they can break teeth i've [03:01] got a few little [03:02] chicken jerky treats i've got a bowl of [03:04] puppy food [03:05] i've got an empty bowl and then i've [03:07] just got a can of wet food [03:09] so what i want to do is i always want to [03:11] trade up so the first thing that i want [03:13] to do is i'm going to [03:15] work on creating a positive association [03:17] with me approaching my puppy in a bowl [03:19] so generally i just give them either a [03:21] little bit of food in a bowl or an empty [03:23] bowl and i'm just going to put my hand [03:24] in [03:24] add some more food and take it away add [03:26] some more food and take it away so that [03:28] way then when i see my hand approaching [03:30] it doesn't mean that i'm going to take [03:31] something away it means that i'm going [03:32] to give them something [03:34] so what we're going to do is we're going [03:35] to condition the dogs that when we [03:36] approach with our hands [03:38] that means that something good is going [03:39] to happen and there's no reason to [03:40] resource guard [03:41] so they guard because they think they're [03:43] going to take something away [03:44] so initially in the beginning steps we [03:46] teach them that we're not going to take [03:47] something away we're going to add [03:48] something even better [03:49] so that way they'll be really happy when [03:51] we approach when we stick our hands in [03:52] the bowl and they don't get defensive [03:54] or insecure thinking that i want to keep [03:55] what i have and i don't want you [03:56] anywhere near it [03:57] i've got the little german shepherd [03:58] puppy that showed resource guarding with [04:00] the other puppies [04:00] now we're gonna test her with people so [04:02] i'm gonna i've got just a little bit of [04:03] dog food [04:04] in here i'm gonna put it down puppy all [04:06] right so i'm gonna let her have the bowl [04:08] and i'm gonna take my hand and i'm gonna [04:10] put it in the bowl [04:12] and i'm gonna have her eat out of my [04:13] hand and i can add it in there [04:16] so i've got a few more kibbles i'm going [04:18] to stick my [04:19] hand in the bowl let her have a couple [04:21] out of my hand [04:22] put it in the bowl and i'm just going to [04:24] keep repeating this [04:25] so as my hand approaches if something [04:27] good is going to happen [04:29] and not something bad so that way that [04:31] she has no reason to guard [04:33] some kibble on my hand reach in and i'm [04:36] kind of pulling her head up too [04:38] and that way she's not hovering over it [04:40] and getting guardy [04:44] if i have a puppy that's having issues [04:45] with this stage just me reaching my hand [04:47] like this and adding something [04:49] and say my puppy started growling or i [04:50] saw that she got stiff [04:52] then i can go to my wet food i always [04:53] want to one-up it [04:56] so as the puppy is eating i'm gonna [04:59] reach my hand in [05:00] and now i have wet food [05:05] you can let the puppy keep eating [05:12] reach my hand in give her the wet food [05:18] you can see now she she would rather [05:20] have the wet food than the kibble [05:22] and that's perfect i'm not going to give [05:23] her the kibble for leaving or the wet [05:24] food for leaving the bowl [05:26] but when she's eating again then i can [05:27] reach my hand in and give her the food [05:30] she's eating i'm going to push her away [05:32] and give her the food [05:35] and let her go back to the bowl [05:42] push her away and give her the food [05:49] and she's a puppy and she's lost [05:51] interest so if this happens while you're [05:53] training [05:54] just you're done for the lesson so you [05:55] can just pick up your bowl and you can [05:56] try again later [05:57] i don't do this every single meal i'll [05:59] do this maybe once a day for the first [06:01] week once i see that my puppy is totally [06:03] fine i leave them alone when they're [06:04] eating [06:05] maybe i'll brush up on this every six [06:08] months or so just to make sure that [06:10] to recondition you know as the puppy's [06:11] eating just approach and put my hand in [06:13] with some high value wet food [06:15] but generally i let my dogs eat in their [06:16] crates or i hand feed them during [06:18] training [06:18] so it's not an issue if you give them [06:21] something that's higher value like a [06:23] bully stick i'm going to show you with [06:24] the different puppy how to trade those [06:25] situations [06:26] but in general my puppies eating i don't [06:28] mess with them i leave them alone [06:30] and that's going to teach the puppy that [06:32] eating is not a stressful place if you [06:34] constantly harass your dog while they're [06:35] eating [06:36] even if they like what you have [06:37] sometimes they just want to be left [06:38] alone so once it's good leave it alone [06:40] it's not something that you want to keep [06:42] working you don't want to harass your [06:43] dog every single time that they're [06:44] eating [06:44] or else you can create problems here's [06:46] another puppy this one's an eight-week [06:47] old male belt and triviren [06:49] we're going to try him out so i've got [06:50] my food go ahead and give it to him [06:53] just like with the last puppy as he's [06:55] eating i'm going to reach my hand under [06:56] his face [06:57] lift his head up let him eat from my [06:59] hand put it in there [07:02] this time i'm going to kind of go a [07:02] little bit faster to see if we can't [07:04] provoke an issue so i can show you what [07:06] to do [07:07] so as he's eating i'm going to push him [07:09] back [07:10] give him some food let him go back to [07:14] eating [07:16] push them back give them some food let [07:19] them go back eating [07:24] and then i want to start kind of messing [07:25] with the dog again if you have little [07:26] kids you want to train for everything so [07:27] i want to make sure he's comfortable i [07:28] pull his tail i'm going to give him some [07:30] food [07:33] while he's eating grab his ear give him [07:35] some food [07:39] pick up his paw give him some food so [07:42] that way if you have little kids that [07:43] are going to harass your dog and they're [07:44] going to do stupid things like that the [07:46] puppies train for it [07:47] and they don't view it as something bad [07:48] they think oh whenever this happens [07:50] something good happens after [07:52] so i can grab scruff give them some food [07:58] so when i'm doing resource guarding with [08:00] a puppy i like to wait until they are [08:01] kind of into their bone [08:03] so if they just start to lay down and [08:04] chew it i'm going to wait a couple [08:05] seconds or wait a minute or two until [08:07] they really get into it [08:09] because once they start to get into it [08:10] it tends to start to get more valuable [08:12] when they're just kind of walking around [08:14] with it they're not really [08:16] consuming it yet and so it tends to not [08:17] be as valuable if you have a dog that's [08:20] really guardy with food then you can [08:21] start before they get into it so that [08:23] way it's lower value [08:25] with her i don't think it's going to be [08:26] an issue so we're just going to kind of [08:27] give her a couple seconds to get into [08:28] the bone [08:29] and then i'll show you how i handle it [08:32] so i want to make sure that whatever i'm [08:33] trying to trade her [08:34] i have the upper hand so if i know that [08:37] on a scale of 1 to 10 [08:38] this bully stick is an eight i want to [08:40] make sure that i'm using a level 10 [08:42] reward [08:42] so that might be bacon uh you know a [08:45] couple pieces of leftover steak [08:47] wet food anything that she's like oh [08:49] yeah take this because i know that i'm [08:50] gonna get something better [08:52] if i'm trying to trade her and take away [08:53] a level eight bone and i'm trying to [08:55] give her [08:56] a level one which is usually a piece of [08:58] kibble she doesn't have that incentive [09:00] to trade [09:01] i want to make sure that i'm trading her [09:02] well so that way she is [09:04] looking forward to me taking stuff away [09:06] and she's not like oh yeah here comes [09:08] this lady who doesn't pay well [09:10] i'm going to assume that my wet food is [09:11] going to be higher value [09:13] so i'm going to be prepared so i'm going [09:15] to have my food in my hand [09:17] and the order of this matters so i don't [09:19] want to bribe the dog i'm not going to [09:21] show her the food first i'm going to [09:23] take it away first [09:24] so if i if i show her the food then [09:26] she's only letting go because she [09:28] has food or because i have food in my [09:30] hand and then if you go to approach and [09:31] trade when you don't have food in your [09:33] hand [09:34] then the dog's not going to let go of [09:36] the food so i want to make sure that the [09:37] letting go [09:38] or i take it away first and then i give [09:40] her something better [09:42] so we'll see if she still wants this [09:50] so even just the smell of the wet food [09:52] was enough that now she [09:54] wants what i have um so i'm gonna see if [09:57] i can't get her interested again [09:59] and if not i might trade for something a [10:01] little bit less valuable because i want [10:02] her to chew on this [10:12] so when he has something i'm just going [10:14] to catch him [10:17] i'm going to take it away and then i'm [10:19] going to trade [10:21] wow my fingers [10:29] so he'll be good for guarding so again [10:31] to go over the most important things [10:32] about preventing resource guarding and [10:34] puppies [10:34] is make sure that you're the one that's [10:36] in control the resources [10:37] the higher value that the resource is [10:40] the more likely that your puppy is to [10:42] resource guard it so just because they [10:43] don't resource guard food [10:45] doesn't mean that they're not going to [10:46] resource guard high value chew bones or [10:48] if they steal something from the trash [10:50] so i want to make sure that from a very [10:52] young age i teach the puppy [10:54] that when they have something if they [10:55] see my hand approaching it's not [10:57] necessarily because i'm going to take it [10:58] away [10:59] it's because i'm going to give them [11:00] something even better so when we [11:01] desensitize them and classically [11:03] condition them [11:03] to be happy about that then i don't get [11:06] that resource guarding [11:07] when i'm teaching my puppy to trade for [11:10] items like a bone or if they get into [11:12] the trash or steal a piece of paper [11:14] i'm taking the item away and then i'm [11:16] feeding them the food [11:18] and whatever food i'm trading for i want [11:20] to make sure that i'm one-upping them [11:21] so if they have a on a scale of one to [11:23] ten if they have a bully stick that's an [11:25] eight [11:25] i wanna make sure that i'm rewarding [11:27] them with a 10 value reward [11:29] if they have something that's maybe a [11:31] three or a four value then i want to [11:32] make sure that i'm rewarding with a five [11:34] or six or even a ten it doesn't matter [11:36] i just want to make sure that the [11:37] puppies understand that if i'm taking [11:38] something out of their mouth [11:40] i'm going to give them something even [11:41] better and then when it comes to that [11:43] pick your battles if your [11:44] dog has a problem trading for the bully [11:46] stick which is a level 8 out of 10 [11:48] then start with something that's a level [11:50] 4 and start trading them at the level 4 [11:52] item [11:53] so just a plain piece of tissue paper or [11:55] a paper towel that you dropped [11:57] take that away and give them something [11:58] better and then build up to a level [12:00] eight or level nine [12:01] um the more that you do this with [12:04] trading items then they're gonna [12:06] understand [12:06] that um there's no reason to guard [12:10] at the same time don't overdo it so [12:12] don't do this every single day don't [12:14] every single time your dog has a bone [12:15] don't take it away because then you're [12:17] going to be the bully [12:18] and you can create anxiety that way [12:19] thank you so much for watching if you [12:21] want to learn more directly from bethany [12:22] and her team here at ph dogs i'm gonna [12:24] have all the information [12:25] in the

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 199/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another episode everyone [00:01] today i am back at riverside california [00:04] ph dogs with professional dog trainer [00:06] bethany perdow [00:07] she's going to be going over some of the [00:08] steps that she likes to take [00:10] when she starts to introduce brand new [00:12] puppies to the leash this is a great [00:14] exercise that i highly recommend doing [00:15] with your own puppies at home [00:17] so this is one of my puppies he's eight [00:18] weeks old and i'm going to show you how [00:21] to teach a puppy how to walk on a leash [00:23] so the first thing that i do is i want [00:24] to make sure obviously the puppy is [00:25] comfortable just wearing a collar [00:27] the collar should be fit snug enough [00:29] that they can't slip out of it [00:31] but loose enough obviously that they're [00:32] not choking and you always want to make [00:34] sure that you're checking puppy collars [00:36] regularly because they obviously grow [00:37] fast you want to make sure it doesn't [00:38] get too tight [00:39] so the first thing that i do is i just [00:40] have a leather leash on him and i'm just [00:42] going to get him comfortable dragging [00:43] the leash [00:44] so if he's not comfortable dragging the [00:46] leash and just feeling the tension [00:48] um from the grass pulling then obviously [00:50] he's not ready for me to hold on to it [00:52] so i just kind of walk the puppy around [00:55] and let him get comfortable dragging the [00:58] leash [00:59] he's going to start biting me in a [01:00] second and he doesn't care [01:02] too much about about the leash [01:11] so that tells me that i can start to [01:12] hold on to it [01:18] i'm gonna go grab some treats here so [01:21] i'm gonna just start rewarding the puppy [01:22] for following me [01:24] so if i walk this way i'm reward the [01:26] puppy where i want him to be [01:27] so if i want my puppy on my left hand [01:29] side i'm gonna have my leash in my right [01:32] my food in my left and that way i can [01:34] just drop the food right off my hip [01:36] and reward him [01:40] and this might be just working for his [01:41] breakfast take a couple steps [01:44] reward him [01:48] good reward him [01:54] follow me around again reward him [02:00] reward him and i don't care about [02:02] perfect heel position i'm just getting [02:04] the puppy to follow me [02:09] good reward so if i have a puppy that [02:11] starts to bite me [02:12] i'm just going to redirect him onto the [02:15] food if he'd rather bite me than take [02:17] the food [02:18] i can trade him for a toy or i can just [02:20] pick up the puppy [02:25] so again if i don't want my puppy biting [02:27] me i can just physically pick them up [02:31] i can wait a couple seconds and then [02:32] just put them down again [02:35] when you pick up the puppy if you're [02:36] having issues with the puppy biting you [02:37] i just point the poor [02:38] the the spiky parts away from me so if i [02:41] if my puppy is biting me and i want him [02:44] to stop [02:45] i just pick him up by the scruff and [02:47] then just point his face away [02:49] so the way that i'm holding him he can't [02:50] turn around and physically bite me [02:52] once he calms down then i can put him [02:55] down and try it again [02:56] so if every single time the puppy starts [02:58] to bite my legs if i just pick him up [02:59] and point them away from me [03:01] kind of give him a little time out then [03:03] he'll understand that that's not the [03:04] game that we're playing [03:06] or i can just reward him before he bites [03:08] me [03:09] but you can see he would rather bite me [03:10] than take the food so that tells me that [03:12] i need either higher value food [03:14] or i need to play with the puppy first [03:16] and get rid of some of this biting so [03:17] he's not going to be a puppy that's [03:18] going to be difficult to walk because [03:20] you can see i can kind of pull on him [03:21] and he doesn't seem to care so i that's [03:24] one thing that i'll check on with the [03:25] puppies [03:26] is just desensitize them a little bit to [03:27] the leash if i pull and then i'll give [03:29] him some food [03:30] i'll kind of pull him just to kind of [03:32] get him comfortable moving in the [03:34] direction of the leash [03:35] if he'll take food that would be perfect [03:37] but because he's not you can see his [03:39] tail is up he's happy i can just get him [03:40] comfortable [03:41] moving with the leash this way too so [03:44] this is a different puppy this is the [03:45] brown collar boy [03:46] so again the first thing i'm gonna get [03:47] him comfortable is dragging his leash [03:48] around [03:50] puppy see if he'll take my food [03:58] good puppy [04:07] see he's pretty comfortable doesn't seem [04:08] to care about it [04:10] i can start to pick it up [04:16] good so again if i have a puppy that i [04:19] don't want biting my legs [04:21] i can try trading for food if the puppy [04:24] would rather bite me than do anything [04:25] else i'm just going to pick them up and [04:27] point [04:27] the pointy part away from me [04:32] or i can have a toy and redirect them [04:34] but if i'm walking and i have nothing on [04:36] me and i just need the puppy to stop [04:37] biting me [04:38] i'm just gonna pick them up by the [04:39] scruff and point them away from me [04:42] and again the way that i'm holding them [04:43] they can't flip around and bite me wait [04:45] for them to calm down [04:46] put them down and start walking again [04:50] good puppy so this is another puppy [04:52] we're gonna get her comfortable just [04:53] dragging the leash to start [04:54] hi let's get her moving around let her [04:57] explore the environment [04:59] if she'll eat my food and if my puppy is [05:01] hungry then i can work on rewarding by [05:03] my left side right where i want her [05:05] and if not i'm just going to work on [05:07] giving to leash tension good girl [05:10] so just two fingers let her get [05:12] distracted and i'm gonna pull pull pull [05:14] good girl second she moves in my [05:17] direction turn on the praise and start [05:18] the petting [05:20] let her go back out [05:32] good girl good girl [05:41] good girl good girl [05:44] this is our dark blue collar boy so [05:46] we're gonna let him drag the leash to [05:47] start [05:50] just walk him around [05:58] i'm gonna start pulling pull pull pull [06:01] good boy good boy [06:08] purple good boy good job [06:12] good boy [06:18] purple purple good [06:22] so in closing when i'm doing my puppy [06:24] leash walking the first step is to get [06:26] them comfortable wearing a collar [06:28] the second step is getting them [06:29] comfortable just dragging around a leash [06:31] the third step is getting them to follow [06:33] me while i'm holding it [06:34] and then the fourth step is teaching [06:36] them that beginning of leash pressure [06:37] where i'm pulling and the second that [06:38] they move in my direction [06:40] and given to leash i praise i pet and [06:42] i'll give them treats if they'll work [06:43] for the food [06:45] if i'm having issues with puppy biting [06:47] me while they're uh [06:48] while i'm starting this i'm just picking [06:50] them up and waiting for them to calm [06:51] down and putting them down or i can [06:53] redirect them with food or redirect with [06:55] a toy [06:55] if you have nothing on you and it's [06:57] really hurting just pick up the puppy [06:58] and hold them away from you [06:59] so another thing that i do when i'm [07:01] teaching my puppies to walk on a leash [07:03] is i generally let them pull around on [07:04] harnesses and flexi leads when i'm not [07:06] doing training [07:08] a lot of people think that harnesses are [07:10] bad [07:11] but they're actually designed for [07:12] pulling so i want my puppies to explore [07:15] when they're doing their initial walks [07:17] and so i will use a harness so that way [07:18] it's the most comfortable for them to [07:20] pull and that way they can go and [07:21] explore and the reason that i do a flexi [07:24] lead versus a regular leash is i want [07:26] them to have that space [07:27] to go explore and i want to be able to [07:29] keep walking so that way the puppies [07:31] learn to follow me and then i'm not [07:33] going to wait for them [07:34] if i'm walking on a six-foot leash and i [07:35] want my puppy to go sniff there [07:37] and they're sniffing and then i'm [07:38] waiting i'm teaching the puppy that i'm [07:39] gonna wait for them and that they don't [07:40] have to pay attention to me [07:42] or if i can walk them on a long flexi [07:44] lead then when they stop to sniff and i [07:46] keep [07:46] walking they learn that they have to pay [07:48] attention to me so the second the puppy [07:50] checks back in [07:51] and they come running up to catch up [07:52] with me i can reward them that way [07:54] and that way the puppies learn from a [07:55] very young age that they have to follow [07:57] me and that i'm not waiting for them [07:59] i hope you guys enjoyed today's episode [08:02] make sure you check out the

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 203/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back everyone to another episode [00:02] i'm here today at ph dogs in riverside [00:04] california [00:05] with professional dog trainer bethany [00:07] perdome as well as sergio from sergio [00:10] and harley's dog training [00:11] he has a youtube channel which i [00:12] recommend you guys checking out i'm [00:14] going to put that [00:15] in the description below and today we're [00:17] gonna be going over how to introduce [00:19] a puppy to your existing dog let's get [00:22] started okay so we have um [00:24] sergio with this new puppy teddy and [00:26] we're gonna be showing sergio how to [00:28] introduce a new puppy [00:29] to his older dog and we want to make [00:31] sure this goes smoothly because we don't [00:33] want to [00:33] traumatize a young puppy we also don't [00:35] want to stress out an older dog so [00:36] usually what i do to start [00:39] is i want to do it through a fence or [00:41] some kind of a barrier [00:42] and that way i'm sure that nothing is [00:43] going to happen if your older dog has [00:46] issues with aggression [00:47] then i would definitely consult a [00:49] trainer and have a trainer help you and [00:50] come out to the house [00:51] because you want to make sure that it [00:52] goes right a little bit of [00:56] being proactive is going to go a very [00:57] long way when it comes to introducing [00:59] your puppy with an adult dog [01:00] so if you know that your your adult dog [01:02] hates puppies find a trainer don't try [01:03] to do this by yourself [01:05] so um with puppies we want to be careful [01:07] about exposing them to parvo and other [01:09] issues [01:10] at the same time we want to make sure [01:11] that we're socializing them so if you [01:13] have [01:14] a park nearby that there's not a lot of [01:16] dogs out you can introduce it at a [01:17] neutral place [01:19] if you don't want to risk parvo then you [01:20] can do it at your house [01:22] if you don't have a fence then you can [01:23] buy like an exercise pin and set up the [01:25] puppy in there [01:27] here we're going to use an outdoor run [01:29] and we're going to show you what to do [01:30] and how to introduce your puppy [01:32] so let's go all right i'm excited when [01:34] we're introducing the puppy to an adult [01:35] dog we always want to make sure the [01:36] puppy has a way [01:38] to get away from the adult dog because [01:40] we don't want to overwhelm a young puppy [01:42] so what we're going to do is we've got [01:44] harley behind a barrier here [01:45] and we're going to walk over with the [01:47] puppy and we're going to let him come up [01:49] and sniff [01:58] hey mama [02:01] so what i'm looking for is body language [02:03] out of both of them so if i see that my [02:05] adult [02:06] dog is freezing or has hair up [02:10] those are things that i want to watch [02:11] for if my adult dog is growling [02:13] i'm obviously not going to move forward [02:16] harley's showing some nice relaxed body [02:17] language her mouth is open her tail is [02:19] wagging [02:20] the puffy puppy is just sniffing around [02:22] so he doesn't seem to be bothered by it [02:26] so kind of see if you can get her to [02:27] engage with the puppy come here moss [02:29] oh yeah come here over here over here [02:32] oh just some sniffing they're like [02:34] kissing so that's really good [02:40] good girl good girl [02:43] oh my god come here [02:46] oh yeah [02:50] so the puppy's tail is up he seems to be [02:52] comfortable harley seems comfortable [02:54] so we can go ahead and move forward with [02:55] the first step if your puppy is not [02:57] comfortable with the adult dog through [02:59] the fence or your adult dog is not [03:01] comfortable with the puppy through the [03:02] fence [03:02] then don't go to the next step so the [03:04] next step that we're gonna do since they [03:05] both seem pretty comfortable is we're [03:07] gonna go ahead and put harley on a leash [03:08] okay so we're just gonna walk them [03:09] together we're not gonna let them [03:11] interact really we're just gonna get [03:12] them comfortable [03:14] walking near each other [03:19] so if my puppy is spicy like this one i [03:22] don't want to overwhelm the adult dog [03:24] by letting the puppy come up and be too [03:27] nippy with her [03:30] nope [03:37] they seem to be pretty comfortable so [03:39] what we can do next [03:40] is this is again where you have to know [03:42] your dual dog so if i know that my dog [03:46] is sometimes least reactive then i'm not [03:47] going to let them say hi and leash [03:49] is harley comfortable on a leash yes she [03:50] is okay so if harley's comfortable on a [03:52] leash then what i'm going to do is i'm [03:53] actually let my puppy off the leash [03:56] and i'm going to keep harley on a leash [03:58] so you're going to try to keep the leash [03:59] loose [04:00] and this way the puppy can go up and [04:02] sniff and say hi if but the puppy can [04:04] also move away if the puppy gets [04:12] nervous [04:16] so you can see the puppy got a little [04:17] nervous so he's going to keep harley [04:18] back and that way the puppy can add some [04:20] distance [04:21] and then approach again when he feels [04:22] more comfortable [04:33] if your adult dog is sniffing and doing [04:35] other things that's totally fine [04:36] don't push the puppy on the adult dog so [04:38] i wouldn't go harley harley and make her [04:40] interact with the puppy [04:42] some adult dogs that are social and they [04:44] understand that the puppy may be [04:45] overwhelmed [04:46] she's actually doing it on purpose so [04:47] that way she's not overwhelming the [04:48] puppy so you can see the puppy can come [04:50] up and sniff and then the puppy can move [04:51] away if he feels [04:52] overwhelmed and you can just do leash [04:56] walks in your backyard like this [04:58] i just want to make sure the puppy [04:59] understands that the big dog's not going [05:01] to hurt him and i want him to build [05:02] trust and confidence [05:04] so go ahead and start walking and we'll [05:06] walk the two of them [05:22] oh [05:32] it's trying to see if it's mom [05:36] i usually stay at this stage for a few [05:37] days [05:39] i don't want my puppy to become too what [05:41] we call doggy which means that they [05:43] build a closer relationship with the [05:44] other dog and they do with the owner [05:46] so especially if you're going to have a [05:49] working dog that you need that [05:50] relationship with and [05:51] even with pet dogs i want to make sure [05:53] that the puppy is looking at me for [05:55] direction and not the other dog [05:57] [Music] [05:58] if you let them get too bonded with each [06:00] other then the puppy doesn't build a [06:02] close relationship with you and then [06:03] they can also create separation anxiety [06:06] with if you ever have to separate the [06:07] two dogs and the puppy doesn't become [06:09] confident on their own because they just [06:10] follow the adult dog [06:12] so i usually let my puppies have limited [06:15] interaction [06:15] you know i'll take them for walks [06:16] together you know i'll turn them loose [06:18] in the backyard for 10 minutes or so [06:20] every day but besides that when the [06:22] puppies are in the house i usually have [06:24] the puppy set up in an exercise pin [06:26] and that way they can see the other dog [06:27] they can sniff but they can't play too [06:29] much [06:31] once my puppy loves me more than the [06:33] other dog [06:34] then i'll let them have more access with [06:36] each other but i want to make sure that [06:37] i build a relationship with myself first [06:39] and then with the second dog [06:46] and you can see he's air humping so [06:47] that's not sexual just over excitement [06:54] now if he's trying to nurse her and she [06:55] snaps at him that's totally warranted [06:57] and i'm not going to correct her for it [06:59] so there's a difference between [07:00] communication and aggression [07:02] communication means hey stop what you're [07:04] doing i don't like that back off [07:06] it's telling the dog to do something [07:08] aggression would be her going out of her [07:09] way [07:10] and grabbing him and hurting him that's [07:12] not okay [07:13] what are some of the cues when to stop [07:15] this if [07:16] you know we're introducing them say [07:17] harley wasn't doing as well or the pup [07:19] wasn't doing as well what are some [07:20] things i should look for [07:21] so i want to look at body language and [07:23] it's more changes of behavior [07:25] so if her mouth was [07:28] closed and now she's panting a lot that [07:30] can be stress [07:31] if her mouth was open and now it's [07:33] closed there's a change of behavior [07:36] if she had her hair flat and then she [07:37] hackled up there's a change of behavior [07:40] if her tail was relaxed like this and [07:42] then it started tucking there's a change [07:43] of behavior [07:44] so just any kind of changes i want to [07:46] pay attention to same thing with the [07:48] puppy if the puppy's tail is up and all [07:49] sudden he drops it there's a change of [07:51] behavior [07:52] with the fluffy puppies it's a little [07:53] bit more difficult to tell but again [07:55] watch for that pile of erection watch [07:56] for that hair going up [07:59] watch for any kind of growling or [08:00] vocalization a lot of times what happens [08:02] is puppies go from [08:04] being scared to being super over the top [08:06] and obnoxious so i want to watch for [08:08] that too [08:08] so as he gets comfortable it's possible [08:10] he might start kind of taking little [08:12] jabs at her and barking at her and [08:13] trying to get her to initiate play [08:15] um and so i want to watch that she's not [08:18] now getting [08:18] gonna get harassed by the puppy so i [08:22] want to make sure that i'm watching for [08:23] both ends of the spectrum i want to make [08:24] sure that the puppy's not getting hurt [08:26] the puppy's not getting scared [08:27] but i also want to protect that older [08:28] dog and not put them in a situation [08:30] where they've got a puppy that's [08:31] constantly [08:32] hanging off their ear or biting their [08:33] tail or harassing them when they're [08:35] eating [08:36] and the eating is another really [08:38] important thing to look for i generally [08:40] don't [08:41] i don't feed my dogs together so with [08:43] puppies usually they're getting hand-fed [08:45] or if i run a time i'm feeding them in a [08:47] crate [08:48] and so by feeding them separate they [08:49] never have to compete for food so it's [08:51] never a problem [08:52] if i put you know i give you a steak [08:55] dinner and every day i come and i start [08:56] stealing your food [08:58] eventually gonna go hey back off this is [08:59] mine i don't want my puppies to get put [09:01] in that situation i want them to know [09:03] there's plenty to go around [09:04] there's no reason to guard so by feeding [09:07] them separate they learn that it's never [09:08] going to be an issue [09:09] it's a lot easier to prevent it and just [09:11] feed them separately than to wait until [09:12] they get into fight over food [09:14] and now i'm trying to fix it later this [09:16] is our yellow collar female puppy [09:18] so what we're going to do is i'm going [09:19] to show you the body language to look [09:20] for so we didn't do the [09:22] introduction through the fence and i [09:24] want you to watch her body language [09:25] so you can see this is very normal puppy [09:28] behavior [09:29] so the screaming the running away that's [09:31] her being scared [09:32] so i have her on leash just to make sure [09:34] that she's not running too far but this [09:35] is why it's really important that you [09:36] keep that adult dog on the leash [09:38] so we're gonna show you how to work [09:39] through this so i'm just gonna try to [09:41] calm her down and bring her to me [09:43] come here good girl [09:47] i'm gonna keep her there we're gonna get [09:49] a little closer here [09:54] good girl so i'm just gonna try to get [09:56] her comfortable being close to the dog [09:57] like this [09:58] now if harley's barking and i think that [09:59] that might scare the puppy i might have [10:01] go ahead and put her in a down [10:02] harley down so by putting her down [10:06] again if if the dog is friendly it puts [10:08] her [10:09] makes her seem a little bit smaller so [10:10] it's less intimidating for the puppy [10:12] if i have a puppy that's an adult dog [10:15] that's not good with puppies [10:16] then putting them in a vulnerable [10:17] position can make it worse for them [10:19] because they might go i need to protect [10:21] myself because now i'm in a vulnerable [10:23] position [10:24] so you have to know your dog so she [10:25] seems pretty relaxed so [10:27] now that we put her in a down so just [10:28] keep her there i'm just going to get my [10:30] puppy comfortable walking by the dog [10:32] so now she's too busy biting i'm just [10:34] gonna peel her off of me [10:37] so i'm gonna have her stay there and i'm [10:38] just gonna get the puppy [10:40] come here being comfortable just kind of [10:43] being right here in my lap [10:45] so the puppy is aware that the dog is [10:46] right there this is what i would call a [10:48] displacement behavior she's just biting [10:49] because she's trying to avoid [10:51] so i'm just going to bring her over here [10:52] wrong down [10:55] and just get her comfortable being close [10:56] to the dog so sergio did a great job the [10:58] dog got up he just put her back [11:01] go so you can see now the puppy's kind [11:05] of curious [11:07] the grass eating is another displacement [11:09] behavior cause she's just a little bit [11:12] insecure [11:14] girl [11:18] good girl [11:26] good girl so just keep her there so now [11:29] the puppy on her own is coming up and [11:30] being a little bit more curious [11:32] again i want to let the puppy if the [11:33] puppy wants to move away i'm going to [11:34] let her move away [11:39] good girl i can fit harley too to show [11:42] her that it's okay [11:53] now we'll go ahead and let her get up [11:54] and just walk her around so don't let [11:56] her say hi to the puppy yet [12:00] so now i just want the puppy to see stop [12:04] i just want the puppy to see her moving [12:06] and her real size [12:08] good girl yeah so now i'm looking at my [12:12] puppy [12:12] is she let's go this way curious is she [12:14] is she nervous [12:15] good girl i don't think my puppy is [12:18] going to run away anymore so i'm going [12:19] to go ahead and let her off the leash [12:20] that way she can approach if she wants [12:22] to [12:24] and i can walk over here [12:41] so i want that curiosity [12:44] just a little insecure so now my puppy [12:46] is more interested in biting than [12:47] playing with the other dog which is fine [12:49] but she's not screaming and run away [12:50] like she was at the start [12:52] so that's success so you can see she's [12:53] sniffing her tail's wagging she's more [12:55] comfortable [12:56] so i might end on that note i'm going to [12:58] show you what not to do now [12:59] so what i don't want to do is i don't [13:00] want to hold on to a puppy and then let [13:02] an adult dog come run into her space [13:04] what happens is because the puppy can't [13:06] go away they're more likely to snap and [13:09] go forward [13:09] because when their back is against a [13:11] wall that's not good because i've [13:13] already introduced her [13:14] now she's feeling a little more [13:15] comfortable because now she's higher so [13:17] in this situation it's okay [13:18] that's why i'm doing it but in general [13:21] you don't want to hold on to the puppy [13:22] and then let an adult dog come into [13:23] their space [13:24] because if they can't move away they're [13:25] more likely to snap and go forward [13:28] the problem with aggression is that it [13:29] works the more [13:31] that the puppy learns that if you get [13:33] scared you can put on this big show and [13:34] snap and bite and it works and you can [13:36] get other things to back away [13:37] then you're in trouble i hope you guys [13:39] enjoyed today's episode as always thanks [13:41] for watching [13:42] if you want to learn more directly from [13:43] bethany and her team here at ph dogs i'm

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 207/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another episode everyone [00:02] i got this cute little puppy teddy [00:03] i'm here at ph dogs in riverside [00:05] california with professional dog trainer [00:08] bethany perdome [00:09] and she's going to be going over some of [00:10] the things that she likes to do with her [00:11] puppies [00:12] that really helps with socializing [00:14] exposure as well as confidence building [00:16] these are going to be some excellent [00:17] exercises that you can do with your [00:19] puppies at home [00:20] to increase their confidence so today [00:22] we're going to talk about puppy exposure [00:23] and socialization [00:24] so i have a little eight week old female [00:25] belt and treveren here [00:27] and we're going to talk about what the [00:29] most important things to do when you get [00:30] a new puppy [00:31] obedience training is really easy [00:33] compared to socialization [00:34] so socialization is also time sensitive [00:37] so if you listen to your vet they'll [00:38] likely tell you don't not take your [00:40] puppy out [00:41] until they're done with all their [00:42] vaccinations the problem with that [00:45] is the key socialization for puppies is [00:47] up to 13 weeks [00:48] by the time your puppy is fully [00:50] vaccinated that socialization period [00:51] will be over and your puppy will be [00:53] likely in a fear period [00:55] so there's a smart way to socialize your [00:57] puppy without [00:59] a super high risk of parvo so parvo is [01:02] the big one in distemper [01:04] what you want to be careful and watch [01:05] out for so with puppies [01:07] we want to avoid high traffic areas [01:10] where there's going to be a lot of other [01:11] dogs [01:12] so puppies catch things from sharing [01:14] water and through dog poop [01:16] so if i have an area that i know [01:18] neighbors don't pick up their [01:19] poop or like the dog park i'm going to [01:21] avoid those places like the plague [01:23] but there's lots of other places that [01:25] you can take puppies to that the [01:26] risk is very minimal like home depot is [01:29] pet friendly lowe's is pet friendly [01:32] you can sit outside of starbucks with [01:33] your puppy sit outside the grocery store [01:35] what we want to expose your puppy to in [01:36] the first 13 weeks is different [01:38] people places and things in different [01:40] surfaces and textures and sounds [01:43] so i'm going to show you how i would [01:44] start with an apical puppy and what i do [01:46] to socialize them [01:48] and how i handle any problems that may [01:50] pop up so if you have a working line [01:51] puppy or a high drive puppy and you have [01:53] livestock it's really important that you [01:54] socialize them and expose them right [01:56] away [01:57] so i'm going to show you how i introduce [01:59] my puppies to my chickens [02:00] so i always have my puppy on leash and [02:02] that way i know that they can't practice [02:03] any kind of chasing behavior [02:05] and i'm just going to kind of put them [02:06] down and let her explore [02:10] so i just want her to get comfortable [02:12] with seeing the animals hearing the [02:13] different sounds [02:14] smelling the smells [02:23] if i want to encourage my puppy to come [02:25] closer i can kneel down and kind of call [02:27] them [02:28] but i basically just want her to see it [02:32] what do you think good girl [02:37] so she doesn't seem too phased [02:45] heard the rooster crow [02:51] so now we're going to bring her over [02:52] here and let her see the donkeys [02:55] so i'm letting her come up on her own so [02:57] i'm just holding lisa she's not moving [02:58] away so i have to chase her [03:00] she can kind of stay focused on task but [03:03] i'm not also forcing her to come up and [03:05] say hi so i'm just holding on the end of [03:06] my leash [03:07] i can say hi to these guys just to kind [03:09] of show her it's okay [03:11] puppy and on her own i want her coming [03:14] up to sniff [03:24] and if my puppy's a little insecure i [03:26] might just sit here for about 15 or 20 [03:28] minutes or so and just let them kind of [03:29] take everything in [03:40] so i'm not babying her i'm not telling [03:41] her it's okay it's okay it's okay i'm [03:43] just let her kind of figure it out on [03:44] her own [03:46] i don't want to have to micromanage so [03:48] you can see her tail carriage she's a [03:49] little insecure [03:51] that's totally normal for puppies so [03:53] what i'm just waiting for is i'm just [03:55] waiting for her [03:56] to not care anymore and that's how i [03:58] know that my training lesson is done [04:00] if you want to use food you can in this [04:02] kind of a scenario [04:04] i really just kind of let my puppy do [04:06] their own thing if they come up to me [04:08] i'll pet them [04:08] but i want them to be involved with the [04:11] other animals i don't want them to just [04:13] be trying to sit in down and try to get [04:15] my food i want them to [04:16] kind of interact with the environment [04:18] right now after their key socialization [04:20] period [04:21] that's when i kind of switch over and [04:23] start getting them to engage in me and [04:24] forget about [04:25] everything else but for those first 13 [04:28] weeks i let people pet my puppies [04:30] i let my puppy play with other [04:32] appropriate social adult dogs that i [04:34] know [04:34] and trust and i let my puppy interact [04:37] with everything else [04:38] once they're in a fear period once they [04:40] hit about 12 13 weeks then i [04:42] switch over and start doing engagement [04:43] work and get them focused on me [04:45] but during those first 13 weeks i want [04:47] them to be comfortable around everything [04:49] and i want them to explore their [04:52] environment [04:53] and get socialized with the other [04:54] animals [04:59] so you can see now her tail is up she's [05:01] waggy [05:03] she's happy so this is this is when i [05:05] would end my lesson [05:06] if my puppy has her tail down i'm just [05:09] gonna hang out here until she's happy [05:10] again [05:13] so then my puppy learns that being happy [05:16] gets you away from here [05:17] so we'll just go ahead and go so here we [05:19] have another puppy that we're gonna [05:20] expose to the horses [05:22] so we're gonna go ahead and put them [05:22] down [05:25] i've got him on leash just to make sure [05:26] that i can control the situation [05:28] i'm just gonna kind of walk up and we're [05:31] gonna see his reaction [05:33] so what i'm looking for again is changes [05:35] of behavior so if his tail was up and [05:37] waggy and then he drops it low i know [05:39] that he's a little bit nervous [05:46] he's just kind of watching tails up he's [05:48] good [05:50] i can bend down with the puppy kind of [05:54] pet him while i say hi to these guys [06:04] hi [06:07] and i'm basically just letting him kind [06:08] of watch and take everything in [06:10] and same thing like we talked about the [06:12] other puppy how i know when to kind of [06:14] end my training lesson is i'm just [06:15] looking for him to relax [06:17] so if he starts chewing on the leash or [06:19] lays down [06:20] and chews on a pine cone or something [06:22] like that that i know that he's [06:23] comfortable [06:26] if he's got his so you can see his ears [06:28] are back his tail is low so he's pretty [06:29] insecure right now [06:31] so i'm just going to sit here and just [06:33] kind of let him hang out [06:35] so i'm not letting him move away good [06:37] boy [06:38] i'm letting him just kind of get [06:39] comfortable with the leash as well and [06:41] i'm essentially just waiting for him to [06:42] relax [06:44] and once the puppy's relaxed then i can [06:46] end my lesson [06:48] so with puppies if he did react say he [06:50] started barking at the horses [06:51] i'm not going to correct him i'm just [06:52] going to redirect him so if i have food [06:55] on me i can say his name give him a [06:56] treat [06:57] i can start kind of walking him to get [06:58] him to move or i can bring him up [07:01] closer so that way he can investigate so [07:03] if i have a young puppy that i'm [07:04] introducing to new people i'm always [07:06] gonna bring the puppy to the people i'm [07:07] not gonna let the people [07:08] approach the puppy so if he's like hey [07:10] what a cool puppy can i say hi [07:12] of course come on puppy and i'm gonna [07:14] bring the puppy to the people [07:16] so that way the puppy is the one that's [07:17] initiating the interaction [07:19] if i have the puppy and again if i have [07:21] a puppy that's nervous and the people [07:22] come and approach the puppy it can be [07:24] overwhelming and the puppy can get [07:26] nervous [07:26] so by having the puppy approach the [07:28] people then the puppy is the one that's [07:30] initiating that interaction [07:31] um and then just like we talked about [07:33] with the other dogs if somebody wants to [07:34] move away [07:35] or isn't wanting to approach then i have [07:37] kind of a guideline of where to start [07:39] socializing my puppy [07:41] if i have a puppy and i'm introducing it [07:42] to young kids [07:44] or say an older lady or something that i [07:46] don't want my puppy jumping up on [07:48] i'm not gonna expect my puppy to hold a [07:50] perfect sit while they're getting pet at [07:51] eight weeks of age [07:52] so what i do is i just kind of kneel [07:54] down with the puppy [07:55] and i'm gonna put one thumb through [07:57] their collar and then i can just kind of [07:59] gently hold the puppy in a sit like this [08:01] so i have one hand on their butt [08:02] one hand under their collar and that way [08:04] i can kind of physically help the puppy [08:06] sit and then if you wanted to come and [08:07] say hi [08:08] then i can keep my puppy in position and [08:10] i can stop my puppy from jumping [08:12] up and this is if you're working with a [08:13] young child yeah so like with little [08:15] kids [08:16] puppies tend to bite they jump up i [08:17] don't want the puppies the kids to [08:19] scream and go running and now my puppy [08:20] wants to bite and chase skins [08:22] and i also don't want the kids go out [08:23] you know and maybe they hit the puppy [08:25] you know because little kids are little [08:27] kids so by just [08:28] sticking my thumb through the collar i [08:31] hear you [08:32] sticking my thumb through the collar and [08:34] then just gently pushing on the puppy's [08:35] butt [08:35] i'm able to keep them in that sit so [08:37] that way they can't practice all that [08:39] bad behavior [08:40] what are some of the best guidelines or [08:42] instructions that you get to little kids [08:43] when they're coming up to meet a new [08:44] puppy [08:45] so i kind of watch the little kids first [08:47] so if the kids look like they're super [08:49] obnoxious if i think that they're not [08:50] old enough to follow directions [08:52] if i think that they're just going to [08:53] kind of get scared and then run away [08:55] then i'm not going to have them interact [08:56] with a puppy but i usually just oh i'm [08:58] sorry he's in training [08:59] that's it i don't want to have to get [09:01] into any issues i just say sorry he's in [09:03] training and that's it they i don't let [09:05] them say hi to my puppy you tell them to [09:06] move slower or something like that um [09:09] it's really hard to control people so i [09:11] generally don't i don't give them [09:13] instructions besides you know my puppy [09:14] may kind of nibble on your fingers [09:16] or they may bite you are you okay with [09:18] that and if they say oh no i'm wearing [09:19] nice clothes okay no problem or again i [09:21] can right now [09:22] yeah so some people go out and they'll [09:24] squeal their hand away [09:25] and now my puppy's gonna want to bite [09:26] you even more or some people think that [09:29] they're dog trainers and they're gonna [09:30] start pinching my puppy's [09:32] gums on their their tongue in their [09:33] teeth or whatever so if i think that [09:35] that [09:36] person is going to be a problem i [09:38] generally don't let them say hi to my [09:39] puppy [09:40] and that's why i generally because [09:42] puppies are a lot more forgiving than [09:43] dogs that are in that fear period [09:45] so i'll let people until that first like [09:46] 13 weeks i'll let strangers pet my puppy [09:49] after that if i have a working line dog [09:51] i generally don't unless i know them [09:53] because everybody has their opinion [09:55] about dogs and if the puppy starts [09:57] getting bitey like this they might [09:59] you know no or whatever and i want my [10:01] puppy to be comfortable biting [10:02] so if if i don't want i don't expect to [10:06] be able to control people [10:07] so if i think that person's gonna be a [10:09] problem i just won't go there [10:11] but if you have a training club if you [10:12] have neighbors if you have like regular [10:14] people that are going to be interacting [10:15] with your dog [10:16] definitely socialize them in those first [10:18] 13 weeks if you know that you have a [10:19] mailman that's [10:20] big and scary looking you know leave [10:22] little freeze-dried liver treats out and [10:24] have every day the mailman comes have [10:25] them feed the puppy for those first 13 [10:27] weeks [10:28] so you know one situation i run into a [10:31] lot [10:31] okay with um with pups and especially [10:33] cute ones like these [10:34] um it's people doing like this kind of [10:37] stuff so we're gonna imagine nate here [10:38] is a puppy right because i don't wanna [10:40] do it to your puppy but they're like [10:42] oh let them smell me them smell me like [10:44] so dogs can sniff cancer [10:46] they can sniff when your blood pressure [10:47] goes low you don't have to shove their [10:49] your hand in their face for them to [10:50] sniff you [10:51] so that's a great way to get bit in the [10:52] hand i mean puppies aren't going to do [10:54] it but [10:55] an adult dog like you're giving them [10:56] like here bite this so i don't do that [10:58] so when i'm greeting a puppy i want them [11:01] to be comfortable again for those first [11:02] 13 weeks i want them to be comfortable [11:04] with all the obnoxious and rude petting [11:06] that they're going to get later so i [11:07] want i'm okay if people go hi puppy [11:09] oh what a cute dog because i want my dog [11:11] to be comfortable with those things [11:13] if i wait until they're older and then [11:15] that happens one day they're more likely [11:17] to have a fearful reaction to it [11:19] so if i know that my dog say somebody [11:20] reaches for my puppy and they're a [11:21] little bit hand shy i'm gonna train that [11:23] i'm with food i'm just gonna reach and [11:25] then give them food and then reach and [11:26] then give them food [11:27] you know grab their ears and then give [11:28] them food go like this and give them [11:29] food [11:30] i'm going to desensitize them and [11:31] counter condition all of those things [11:32] that they're going to run into [11:34] um later i'm going to teach them that as [11:36] a puppy now so i want them to be [11:37] comfortable somebody going oh look at [11:38] your little feedies and oh look at your [11:40] ears and oh you're so cute [11:42] you know i want them to be comfortable [11:43] with all of those things so that way [11:45] when they do meet the general public and [11:47] people are super obnoxious he's like oh [11:49] it's no problem because my mom does all [11:50] kinds of weird things to me [11:52] if you only pet your dog you know really [11:54] gently under the you know like this [11:56] you're not exposing them to all the [11:58] things they're going to run into kids [11:59] are going to go [12:00] high people are idiots they blow into [12:02] dogs faces just to see what they're [12:04] going to do [12:04] right so or they go look he's got [12:06] something in his paw what is it you know [12:07] and they're just super invasive with the [12:09] dog [12:10] so you want to show the puppies all of [12:12] those different things and like i said [12:13] the first 13 weeks [12:14] i'm okay with however people interact if [12:16] i see that the puppy's kind of getting [12:18] overwhelmed i'll [12:19] hey let's go over here and i'll just [12:20] kind of redirect him oh thanks and i'll [12:21] just kind of wander off [12:23] but in general i let people kind of [12:26] interact with puppies however they want [12:28] if i see that my puppy's kind of hand [12:30] shy as people reach over then i'm just [12:31] going to train it [12:33] if i see that they're starting to flank [12:34] the puppy and what if what if i do this [12:36] then obviously i'm going to go hey you [12:37] know [12:37] buy and i'm gonna leave um if i'm [12:40] meeting an adult dog [12:41] um i generally ask the person first hey [12:44] may i [12:45] say hi to your dog and if they say yes [12:47] then i ask the dog [12:48] and how i ask the dog is so if this was [12:50] your dog say it's an adult dog [12:52] oh what a cute dog may i say hi sure so [12:55] i'm gonna go [12:56] um i'm not gonna go direct on to the dog [12:59] i'm gonna turn sideways and kind of bend [13:00] down [13:01] and i'll put my hand just by my side so [13:03] that way if the dog wants to say hi [13:05] they're going to approach me [13:06] by turning my body language to the side [13:08] i'm not putting any kind of pressure [13:10] over the top [13:11] and i'm inviting the puppy into my space [13:13] if the puppy [13:14] or the dog stays back i'll go okay have [13:16] a good day and i'll go off [13:18] because even though the person says yes [13:19] you can say hi to my dog the dog is [13:20] going i don't want anything to do with [13:22] you [13:22] if that dog stayed back and i went into [13:24] their space [13:25] now i'm the one that's going into their [13:28] bubble and again because they're on [13:29] leash [13:29] they have no way to go back so they're [13:31] more likely to go forward if they get [13:32] overwhelmed [13:34] so even if the person says yes i look at [13:36] the dog's body language [13:38] is the dog kind of looking at me whale [13:39] eye are their ears back are their mouth [13:41] open or closed where's the tail [13:43] i'm looking at the whole dog to see is [13:45] this dog gonna appreciate this [13:46] interaction or not so now we're going to [13:48] show you how to do some environmental [13:50] exposure with puppies [13:52] so we're going to do the tarp to start [13:57] so we're just going to kind of see what [13:59] the puppy thinks about it try to get him [14:01] to walk over it [14:02] good job so this moves it makes sound [14:06] those are all things you want to kind of [14:08] look for [14:10] i want to see his he doesn't care he's [14:12] biting [14:14] this is more for working dogs than pet [14:16] dogs but it's good for pet dogs to [14:19] be comfortable and confident too [14:24] so i'm just gonna kind of let it make [14:25] some sounds [14:27] check his reaction to it tail is up he's [14:31] waggy he doesn't care [14:33] i can start to make some bigger [14:34] movements [14:36] see he's happy he just wants to bite [14:38] he's comfortable [14:42] walk over it [14:45] hey puppy puppy [14:49] come on so you can see he's [14:52] he's happy he doesn't care about this hi [14:56] puppy [15:00] so now we'll try the tunnel bring them [15:01] up to the entrance and have surgery go [15:03] to the other side [15:04] and just kind of encourage them to come [15:06] through come on come here [15:08] yay come on come on no he's gonna go [15:10] around [15:14] puppy hi there he goes good puppy [15:18] yay puppy good puppy and we're gonna [15:22] kind of call the puppy back and forth [15:24] come [15:34] so i'm just kind of blocking it off so [15:35] he can't go around he's not scared of it [15:38] he just wasn't sure [15:39] really what i want come on good [15:42] good puppy come on come on puppy [15:47] come on come on come on come on come on [15:50] come on [15:51] good boy we can kind of make a little [15:54] bit longer here [15:55] come on hey come here [16:01] come here puppy puppy puppy puppy [16:05] come on come on come come on come here [16:09] oh come here he's just sniffing a little [16:12] bit longer here [16:17] hi baby good job [16:20] so the nice thing about this is it does [16:21] move a little bit it's a little bit dark [16:23] he has to go away from you [16:25] so for puppies this is

The school he founded is the culmination of that passion, and their students and graduates share his dedication. Over the past four decades, TRS graduated a major percentage of the foremost trainers in the world. Employers snap up at their alumni.  Those who start their own businesses succeed consistently. One very successful graduate put it this way,  “There is no other school with the experience and instructional track record of TRS. There is no other school that teaches many different training techniques, then encourages the student to choose the methods most comfortable for them."" Tom authored three major dog-training books. He won training competitions time after time with dogs he raised and trained. He pioneered and developed the celebrated Puppy Imprinting Program. He coined the phrase ""imprinting"" as it applies to dogs.  He is first to import the Belgian Malinois breed to the United States."

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 211/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another episode everyone [00:02] i am back at the tom rose school in high [00:04] ridge missouri [00:05] school for professional dog trainers and [00:07] today we are going to be going over [00:08] three of the exercises in agility [00:11] agility is a great thing to do with your [00:13] dog [00:13] it's good for bonding and most dogs do [00:16] enjoy it [00:16] so what we're going to be going over in [00:18] this video is the a-frame [00:20] walk-it and teeter let's go ahead and [00:22] get started [00:27] all right i'm here with rocky one of the [00:28] instructors at the tom rose school he's [00:30] going to be explaining to you the steps [00:32] that he likes to teach his students [00:34] while they're going through the course [00:35] in order to learn understand and perfect [00:37] the a-frame [00:38] so when the students pass the dogs do it [00:40] the correct way so [00:42] all right so there's a couple ways that [00:43] i can do this right one way we can do it [00:45] is we [00:46] take a nice treat something probably [00:47] malleable put it on the contact point [00:50] so when you're going up you want to put [00:51] it closer to the top so i'll put this [00:53] one right here [00:54] right and then when you're going down [00:58] you want to put it closer to the bottom [00:59] because you want to make sure that the [01:00] dog hits the contact point okay [01:02] this also helps with the dog flying over [01:04] the obstacles as well [01:06] they tend to slow down and hit the [01:08] contact [01:09] we're going to start with a puppy and [01:11] when you're doing this [01:12] the reason why he's emphasizing these [01:14] contact points is [01:15] they have to touch these points when [01:17] they're testing in order to pass [01:19] if the dog jumps over the yellow area [01:22] indicating the contact point or they [01:24] don't touch the one on the other side [01:25] it's a fail [01:26] so this is why it's so important to do [01:28] this step so we have a puppy we can [01:30] bring over [01:31] we have ben here and he's gonna be using [01:33] his puppy to help us with this [01:34] demonstration [01:35] awesome so go ahead and get started real [01:38] quick right [01:40] so you see how this dog slows down wraps [01:42] the treat [01:43] talk to him [01:49] slow down again [01:53] now what happens if you have a puppy or [01:55] a dog that you're working with that [01:57] seems a little timid [01:58] are there certain steps that you like to [02:00] take that help the dogs overcome that [02:02] so what you can do is start the dog up [02:05] here [02:06] right so we'll put them up here and do [02:07] the same thing so ben [02:09] if you don't mind more than just the [02:10] contact point but that just depends on [02:13] the dog okay [02:13] okay cool you want to go ahead and put [02:14] them up top [02:22] good so that's the way i would address [02:24] that okay excellent [02:25] and what's something that may be [02:27] different when you're working with an [02:28] older dog [02:29] when you're working with an older dog [02:30] you might be able to do the same process [02:32] um it just it depends so i would um [02:36] sometimes even go to just lauren so i'll [02:38] take the treat go up with the dog [02:41] and then once he gets right about here [02:42] yes give him a treat is that an option [02:44] we can do with the puppies as well [02:46] yeah ben do you mind demonstrating with [02:47] yours using some luring and have them go [02:49] over nice and slow that way [03:10] the main idea is we want to make sure we [03:12] create a positive association with the [03:14] training [03:14] and learning the a-frame the more fun [03:16] the dog has the faster they're going to [03:18] learn [03:18] and the easier it's going to be for the [03:20] trainer all right so now we have an [03:22] older dog here [03:23] and if you don't mind demonstrate the [03:24] process of how i know he knows how to do [03:26] it already [03:27] but the training process [03:34] and as you guys as you guys can see he [03:38] already knows it so he's ready to just [03:39] jump over and do the obstacle the [03:40] correct way [03:41] when we are starting we would lure them [03:43] right if it's an older dog you would [03:44] lure [03:45] or like you said if your dog's not [03:47] motivated by food [03:48] maybe you have a low motivation dog when [03:50] it comes to their food drive [03:51] if they like toys we can use toys as [03:53] well i've even seen some people go over [03:55] the a-frame with their dog [03:57] if the dog is motivated by the person [03:59] and not food or toys [04:00] but the main idea is taking something [04:02] that's going to motivate your dog to get [04:04] them to do the obstacle and the other [04:05] big takeaway is that they stop on these [04:07] contact points or at least rather [04:09] slow down so they're not missing those [04:11] contact points so pretty simple exercise [04:13] but make sure you guys take your time [04:14] with it with everything we're doing with [04:16] our dogs [04:16] we want to be patient and we want to [04:18] move at the speed that the dog is [04:20] progressing at [04:21] that we're training for that specific [04:23] exercise so let's [04:24] head on over to the walk-it [04:31] okay in teaching the dog walk we begin [04:34] with the walk almost flat on the floor [04:37] we'll usually put a [04:38] couple of concrete blocks under it so [04:40] it's only about a foot off the ground [04:42] uh oftentimes we'll place food along the [04:45] dog walk [04:46] and on leash without a correction collar [04:49] will lead the dog over the walk [04:51] showing him the food as we go [04:54] once he's comfortable with climbing up [04:56] on the dog walk and walking across it [04:58] we'll raise it up a little bit generally [05:00] we'll take the saw horses that you see [05:02] under it now [05:03] we'll turn them on their side and [05:06] allow the dog to go up and over at a [05:09] much lower [05:10] level once he's doing that well we'll do [05:13] the same thing but we'll bring it up to [05:15] full height [05:17] the handler always stays close to the [05:18] dog in case there'd be a mistake he [05:20] might fall off we can always grab them [05:22] before they do very rare that that would [05:24] happen in the way that we built them up [05:26] they're more interested in getting the [05:27] food [05:28] and getting to the next piece and it's [05:30] very unusual to have a dog that's afraid [05:33] of the dog walk okay we're gonna [05:35] demonstrate [05:36] teaching the dog walk the handler is [05:38] going to hand me his dog [05:39] and he's going to place food randomly [05:42] over the dog walk [05:44] okay [05:47] always putting a piece of food on the [05:49] yellow [05:51] area [05:54] at different spacing as he goes across [05:59] then you come back and get the pup [06:02] holding fairly close on the leash [06:04] for safety reasons and lead him over the [06:08] dog walker [06:15] he's got his arm over the puppy so he [06:17] can't fall off to the left [06:27] it's a very successful time going over [06:30] the dog walk we don't want him to turn [06:31] around and ever go backwards they only [06:33] go one way on this jump [06:35] so it's important even if the puppy [06:36] wants to turn around and go back hoping [06:38] that there's more food [06:40] that he doesn't do that the next step [06:42] would be to take the dog [06:43] off leash and do essentially the same [06:46] thing [06:47] but he'll remain near the dog as he goes [06:49] over the dog walk [06:50] but he'll have to place food once again [06:53] on the dog walk [06:55] same thing handler's walking right next [06:57] to the puppy all the way [07:02] and then he catches him on the other [07:04] side this case picks him up [07:06] so he can't reverse direction and go [07:08] over the jump the wrong way [07:10] now he can do almost the same thing he's [07:12] going to space out the food [07:14] more and he will not accompany the dog [07:17] he'll walk [07:17] near the dog but he won't walk right [07:21] next to him as he's done in prior [07:23] tries [07:28] again we removed the leash for safety [07:31] it's [07:31] too likely the leash could get caught on [07:34] in between [07:43] the pup actually went so fast [07:47] that he missed food which is not unusual [07:50] uh [07:51] as we progressed with the training we [07:53] could [07:54] ultimately only put food on the final [07:57] contact [07:58] area and the beginning contact area just [08:00] to make sure the dog's always [08:02] touching the contact area the very last [08:05] step would be to do the same thing [08:06] without food and then you're ready to go [08:08] with the exercise [08:13] so now we have the teeter and tom's [08:15] going to be breaking down explaining in [08:16] detail how he likes to teach his [08:18] students [08:19] so they know how to train their dogs to [08:20] properly work on the teeter [08:23] first of all we begin with the dog walk [08:26] we wait till the dog [08:27] is secure walking the narrow plank over [08:30] the dog walk [08:31] he's comfortable with it he's not a bit [08:33] concerned at that point we can move on [08:35] to the teeter [08:37] the problem is with the teeter is of [08:39] course the floor falls out from [08:41] underneath him which scares a lot of [08:42] dogs [08:43] so it's very important in the early [08:45] stages [08:46] that we keep it low first of all so it's [08:49] on the lowest setting [08:51] and second of all that the handler walks [08:54] along with the dog [08:55] and lowers the teeter themselves so it [08:58] doesn't go [08:59] slamming down and scare the dog the [09:01] worst thing could happen here [09:03] is for the dog especially a young puppy [09:06] to have a bad experience become fearful [09:08] of it [09:09] okay we're gonna again place food [09:12] in both contact zones and maybe one in [09:14] the middle [09:15] keeping in mind the dog's already done [09:17] this on the dog walk so this is nothing [09:19] more than another dog walk [09:21] as far as he's concerned now i would [09:24] place the food [09:25] in the middle of the contact [09:30] because you don't want them jumping too [09:32] hard [09:35] there we go [09:38] so as she goes over she's gonna [09:43] take her hand and reduce the drop [09:48] okay so that went smoothly we could [09:51] have a helper assist in lowering this [09:55] as with myself i could stand here and [09:58] lower [09:58] the only trouble is we're adding another [10:01] thing that the puppy may have to get [10:03] used to [10:04] some may be worried about a stranger [10:07] but we'll go ahead and try it with this [10:09] pup just to demonstrate okay [10:12] yes good job you got this yes [10:20] that worked better that time the hannah [10:22] realized the puppy was going to be a [10:23] little bit fearful of me [10:25] and prevented her from being able to [10:28] jump off [10:29] next step would do the same thing on [10:31] leash but this time we won't catch the [10:33] tee it will allow it to go down [10:35] which may concern the puppy or may not [10:37] it depends on the puppy [10:39] and if you do have a problem you have to [10:40] go back to lowering it [10:42] so it goes down slowly so this will be [10:46] the first time it's allowed to slam down [10:47] on its own [10:50] okay the food bounced off she's [10:56] good but this particular puppy [10:57] doesn't seem to have any problem with [11:00] the teeter slamming down to the ground [11:02] even though you could say it shook the [11:04] puppy quite a bit [11:05] and a common question that's asked in a [11:07] lot of my training videos is [11:08] how many times should somebody have to [11:10] do it before their dog is doing it [11:12] correctly and what i always say is it's [11:14] based on [11:14] each individual dog so they may have to [11:17] go through 30 times [11:19] with the food and the leash and the [11:20] guiding before they're even able to get [11:22] to this point [11:22] right based on performance not number of [11:25] repetitions exactly [11:26] for each individual dog so some dogs [11:28] maybe 10 reps is enough others may need [11:30] 50.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 212/841,[11:31] so or 100 yeah exactly do it for two [11:34] weeks before we've had dogs were [11:36] scared to death of the dog walk got them [11:38] used to that [11:39] went over to the teeter they went and [11:42] allowed it to slam down too soon the dog [11:44] then became afraid of the teeter [11:45] we had to go back to the dog walk which [11:47] he's now afraid of [11:48] go through that come back over here [11:50] again so we want to avoid those problems [11:52] and when they get to the point when [11:53] they're still assisting they could still [11:55] assist but allow it to go down a little [11:57] bit faster each time [11:59] up and to the point so it doesn't have [12:00] to go from assisting to a straight drop [12:02] even though we are assisting but we can [12:03] gradually increase the speed of it [12:05] dropping based on how much we're holding [12:07] it correct yeah [12:08] this next time we're going to do it [12:09] off-leash but food is still on it [12:14] run all the way to the end all the way [12:16] down [12:22] that worked well but did you notice that [12:24] because she didn't go in line with the [12:26] teeter [12:27] the puppy went off to the side so we're [12:29] creating a bad habit [12:31] if instead she had been right in line [12:33] with the teeter [12:34] then the puppy would have had an [12:37] perfectly straight exit from the teeter [12:39] which is exactly what we want to teach [12:41] and again the reason why we put food on [12:43] the contact points is number one to make [12:45] sure the dog is touching the contact [12:47] points [12:47] but more importantly on this side that [12:49] the teeter touches the ground [12:51] before the dog jumps off right because [12:53] if the dog jumps off before the teeter [12:54] touches the ground [12:55] that's a disqualification correct and [12:57] that's why we're putting the food [12:59] about here on the teeter because when [13:01] the dog eats it it [13:02] while it's eating the teeter is going to [13:04] lower to the ground and since our dogs [13:07] are creatures of habit [13:08] if you do something enough times the dog [13:10] is going to believe that there's a [13:11] reward here [13:12] even if there's not a reward so when you [13:14] are going to [13:15] test this the dog is going to come make [13:17] sure that the teeter touches the ground [13:19] before they [13:20] jump off because they're looking for a [13:22] possibility of a reward [13:23] next rep we're going to do off lead but [13:26] with food [13:27] only on the final contact and this time [13:30] try to swing around and get in line with [13:32] the [13:33] teeter as the dog exits [13:39] yes good girl [13:44] and she got a perfect x at that time the [13:46] main takeaways that we have from each of [13:48] these obstacles in the agility [13:50] is going to be making sure your dog [13:51] touches the contact points and making [13:53] sure your dog stays [13:55] safe so with that being said something [13:56] that was brought up before [13:58] in some of our training here at the [13:59] school was puppies doing agility [14:01] and people were saying that that's bad [14:03] for them and it could be dangerous [14:04] but you actually did some additional [14:06] research on it can you explain a little [14:08] bit [14:08] what you did and how safety is always [14:10] such an important thing [14:11] yes we contacted a couple of orthopedic [14:14] veterinarians and ask them [14:16] what they thought about what we were [14:18] doing and teaching agility in one case i [14:20] think we actually showed them a video [14:22] of dogs doing agility at the at the [14:24] school [14:25] and their opinion was is absolutely safe [14:29] i said we don't do anything that puppies [14:32] play in the bed [14:33] together in the backyard wouldn't be [14:34] doing the same uh [14:36] it's the worst thing would be falling [14:38] off for something like the dog walk or [14:40] something like that [14:42] we've had puppies fall off of decks and [14:45] all kinds of things just [14:46] plain in the backyard and they said they [14:48] don't believe that that would lead [14:50] towards hip dysplasia [14:51] or any other obvious physical [14:55] problem yeah and sometimes just having [14:57] puppies go up and down stairs could [14:58] actually be more on [14:59] than these uh obstacles and agility so [15:02] again important thing is making sure [15:04] you're safe [15:04] making sure your puppy's safe and when [15:06] they're doing the obstacle they're [15:07] touching the contact points [15:09] so you're getting the correct [15:10] repetitions every time so if you do [15:11] decide to compete [15:12] your dog does it the right way and you [15:14] pass with a nice high score [15:16] if you are of the opinion that [15:20] teaching agility to a puppy at a young [15:23] age is [15:24] dangerous for the puppy i would [15:26] recommend that you talk to your own [15:27] veterinarian [15:28] and get their opinion and go by that [15:30] veterinarian's opinion [15:32] absolutely or if they really feel [15:34] uncomfortable wait till the dog's older [15:36] that's fine as well we like starting [15:37] with puppies when they're young [15:39] because imprinting is such an important [15:41] thing when it comes to training a dog [15:42] and if you can get your young puppy to [15:44] enjoy something when they're training at [15:46] that young age they're going to love it [15:47] so much more when they're older and it's [15:49] going to make it that much easier [15:50] to train them at that very high level so [15:53] thanks again for watching everybody [15:55] thanks again tom i

The school he founded is the culmination of that passion, and their students and graduates share his dedication. Over the past four decades, TRS graduated a major percentage of the foremost trainers in the world. Employers snap up at their alumni.  Those who start their own businesses succeed consistently. One very successful graduate put it this way,  “There is no other school with the experience and instructional track record of TRS. There is no other school that teaches many different training techniques, then encourages the student to choose the methods most comfortable for them."" Tom authored three major dog-training books. He won training competitions time after time with dogs he raised and trained. He pioneered and developed the celebrated Puppy Imprinting Program. He coined the phrase ""imprinting"" as it applies to dogs.  He is first to import the Belgian Malinois breed to the United States. Graduation from TRS depends upon successfully accomplishing industry-recognized objectives and requirements. The Tom Rose School curriculum is proven effective in meeting and exceeding those requirements."

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 216/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back everyone and we are at the [00:01] tom rose school for professional dog [00:03] trainers working on agility [00:05] so this is part two of a three-part [00:07] series for our agility [00:09] today we're gonna be going over the [00:10] weave pole the paws table [00:12] and the tunnel so let's not waste any [00:14] more time and get started [00:19] we're going to start with the weave pull [00:21] tom is going to be explaining and [00:22] demonstrating how he likes to teach the [00:23] students [00:24] so they know how to properly train their [00:25] dogs for this exercise [00:28] well some background work that we'd want [00:30] to do before beginning the weave poles [00:32] uh mainly getting the dog [00:35] used to dealing with food and perhaps we [00:38] can have [00:39] you demonstrate that [00:42] basically holding food in your hand and [00:44] doing the hand kiss [00:46] we've taught the dog as a puppy to [00:48] follow her hand [00:49] she can actually make the dog go around [00:51] behind her through her legs whatever she [00:53] wants to do [00:54] we refer to that as a hand kiss so [00:58] dogs got to understand that food is [01:00] going to come from the hand [01:04] and frequently they don't give an entire [01:06] piece the dog will let them [01:07] sliver off little pieces of food much [01:10] like you would do with the show dog [01:12] okay with that already trained we can [01:14] begin the weave poles [01:16] and then she can guide with her hand [01:19] the puppy through the weave poles [01:24] yes [01:30] and notice we have the full length of [01:33] weave poles even though for novice [01:35] agility we don't need them but this is [01:37] the way we teach it [01:39] very good now it could be [01:43] successfully argued by teaching this way [01:46] it's causing the dog to be dependent on [01:49] being guided with the hand [01:51] and the idea behind it is we do enough [01:53] repetitions [01:55] the dog will begin to follow the hand [01:57] without food [01:58] and finally we won't have to guide the [02:01] dog with the hand at all [02:02] it would be disqualifying for the [02:04] handler to reach [02:05] through the weave poles at a shell the [02:07] handler has to stay away [02:09] from the weave poles so they can still [02:12] move the hand but they can't [02:13] guide the dog through them also when the [02:16] dog begins the weave poles [02:18] they always make a left turn so they go [02:20] away from the handler [02:22] and weave this way they don't [02:26] begin this way [02:32] and she's saying weave each time [02:37] over a long enough period of time the [02:38] dog should learn the word [02:40] now if we can we like to use food and we [02:42] like to use the hand touch to teach the [02:44] dog the weep holes but [02:45] if a dog doesn't have food drive are [02:47] there other options there are [02:49] however the puppies that we run through [02:52] our imprinting program [02:53] all have food drive that's part of [02:56] inputting [02:56] but if they don't you could use a toy uh [03:00] preferably not a ball something a [03:02] cylinder [03:03] shape a tug toy something that feel [03:06] dummy [03:07] some of that nature and you can just [03:09] present it to the dog [03:10] as you lead them through the only [03:12] problem is how many times are they going [03:14] to weave [03:15] before they get the toy so in order to [03:17] make that work you're going to have to [03:18] go two or three [03:20] and then throw it three or four and then [03:21] throw it until eventually you can get [03:23] them to do the entire [03:25] set of weep holes so it's doable with a [03:27] toy but preferably if we can [03:29] we like to use a little bit more [03:31] difficult but i think people would also [03:33] argue [03:33] they would prefer to teach it with a toy [03:36] because the dog [03:37] is learning that only gets the toy when [03:40] he does go through the weaves [03:42] so if he doesn't go through the weaves [03:43] he may not get the toy [03:45] and you can start them over unlike with [03:47] food where they're getting a piece [03:48] through every single [03:50] pole at least in the beginning all right [03:52] excellent well that's good to know for [03:53] people if you have a dog that doesn't [03:55] have that high food drive you can use a [03:56] toy [03:57] and help them there but it could be a [03:58] little extra work so make sure you take [04:00] your time with it all right let's jump [04:01] onto the next exercise which is going to [04:03] be the pause table [04:08] the next exercise we're going to go over [04:10] is the pause table again tom's going to [04:12] be explaining how he likes to teach the [04:13] students [04:14] to train their dogs to perform this [04:15] exercise [04:17] with our puppy imprinting one of the [04:19] first things we do is we've been again [04:21] teaching them to do what we call a climb [04:23] when we say the word climb [04:25] to get up on the bench and to stay there [04:27] until we tell them it's okay to get off [04:29] so for puppies that we imprint here at [04:31] the school the [04:33] paws table is nothing it's just another [04:35] climb bench as far as they're concerned [04:38] so all she needs to do is simply say [04:41] climb [04:42] the dog's going to climb up [04:47] and now the dog has to stay on the paws [04:49] table until the evaluator or the judge [04:51] tells the judge tells them it's time to [04:53] leave now [04:54] in teaching the climb table if you've [04:57] not done the background that we just [04:58] mentioned [04:59] what i would ask the handler to do is to [05:02] stand [05:02] about here with puppy on your left side [05:05] so he can't go behind you or through you [05:07] and say climb and just lead him with the [05:11] leash [05:12] up onto the pause table praise pet [05:16] and feed once he's there and then over a [05:18] period of time step further and further [05:20] weight is like you would do [05:21] in teaching the stay exercised and to [05:24] he understands to stay on the pause [05:26] table excellent can we demonstrate that [05:29] as well [05:33] so that was great she started with the [05:34] lure making sure that the dog is able to [05:37] perform the exercise [05:38] with the lure and then of course if she [05:39] wants to add the command [05:41] she can give the command and then [05:42] execute with the physical cue [05:44] whether she's using a lure or as tom [05:46] mentioned using the leash to guide the [05:48] dog to the position so she gives the [05:49] command [05:50] then the cue or both the lure and the [05:52] leash or the lure and the leash [05:53] absolutely [05:56] but the dog has to stay there until the [05:58] handler tells them it's okay to exit [06:01] now when you do that do you just give [06:02] the dog the command to the next exercise [06:04] or what do you like to tell the dog when [06:06] they're done with the paws table i tell [06:07] them free [06:08] meaning they can depart the claws table [06:10] then i might say [06:11] dog walk tongue or whatever they're [06:13] going to do for you just because in my [06:14] videos i use the word free as a marker [06:17] you use free as just a release word [06:19] right [06:19] so it's just releasing the dog from the [06:21] position it's not guaranteeing a reward [06:23] like a parade rest for a soldier [06:25] excellent so if you've been watching my [06:27] series i use the word break [06:29] tom uses the word free it doesn't matter [06:31] what word you use just make sure you [06:33] pick a word and you stay consistent with [06:35] that [06:35] so that's just a release word and again [06:37] a release word simply releases a dog [06:39] from a position [06:40] whereas when i use free in my other [06:42] videos i'm using that as a marker [06:44] meaning the dog's going to get rewarded [06:46] and they're also released so just be [06:47] aware of what words you're using and [06:48] you're consistent with your dog [06:50] on to the next exercise [06:55] the next exercise is going to be the [06:57] tunnel tom okay [07:00] first of all we typically begin by [07:02] compressing the tunnel [07:04] and making it small keep it straight so [07:06] the dog can see through it [07:08] best thing to use would be a long line [07:12] and two people first of all the handler [07:15] is very close to the beginning of the [07:16] tunnel [07:17] the dog is hooked to the line the helper [07:19] is quite a distance away from the end of [07:21] the tunnel [07:22] now what we want to have happen here is [07:24] the handler is going to say tunnel [07:27] the helper is going to put gentle [07:29] tension on the line to make sure the dog [07:30] doesn't go the wrong way [07:32] while that's taking place the handler is [07:34] going to come here [07:35] and she can clap and encourage and have [07:38] a toy [07:39] to give the dog when he exits this end [07:41] you ready [07:46] yeah and usually i would [07:49] drop the toy or toss it and make it roll [07:52] towards the helper [07:54] but that worked well and since this [07:56] dog's already trained on the tunnel he's [07:58] going through much faster than [07:59] a dog who's just learning the exercise [08:02] so you guys need to keep that in mind [08:03] since he's already trained your dog's [08:05] not going to go through as quickly [08:06] so going to the other side as tom [08:08] explained to encourage the dog and [08:09] reward them [08:10] is going to be a key factor when you're [08:11] training your dog and the reason for the [08:13] long line is [08:15] prevent the dog from reversing direction [08:17] or missing the tunnel altogether which [08:19] a lot of puppies will do because they [08:21] don't understand why they need to go [08:22] through it [08:23] the next step is with his tunnel so [08:26] compressed [08:27] the handler is going to remove the leash [08:29] and [08:30] put the dog on a sit stay if she can do [08:32] that and then she'll [08:34] tell the dog tunnel as the dog goes [08:36] through she'll throw the ball [08:39] and the dog will come straight out of [08:40] the tunnel and get the ball [08:42] and so that will actually help increase [08:45] the speed of the dog doing the exercise [08:47] as well right because now the dog's [08:48] anticipating the possibility of a reward [08:51] on the other side of the tunnel [08:52] right even though it can't see the ball [08:54] when it's starting okay let's go ahead [08:55] and try that [08:59] good now we would extend it [09:02] but we still keep it straight so you [09:04] could probably go [09:06] half length full length whatever you [09:07] wanted to do maybe like that depending [09:09] on the dog [09:10] okay right so we'll do the same exact [09:13] thing again [09:13] same [09:17] good and that time the dog flew through [09:20] without turning around and coming back [09:21] at you [09:22] and we would continue to extend it as [09:24] long as the dog is progressing and doing [09:26] it nicely [09:27] so they have to read their dog and see [09:28] how well the dog's performing and how [09:30] confident your dog is in the exercise [09:32] and [09:32] when the dog seems to be confident and [09:34] they're doing it well then we extend [09:35] yeah [09:36] so with this dog if we were actually [09:38] starting this dog for the first time we [09:40] could extend it pretty quickly because [09:41] the dog is performing it so well [09:44] even though he's already trained on it [09:48] so in this case it's straight so the dog [09:50] can see through it [09:54] by throwing the ball straight away it's [09:56] causing the dog [09:57] not to look at the handler when you do [09:59] in fact want the dog to look at the [10:01] handler [10:02] i generally get to get speed i like [10:04] throwing the ball [10:05] because the dog anticipates and he goes [10:07] faster there will come a time [10:09] where he'll go through and the handler [10:11] might actually call [10:12] the dog to her and then throw the ball [10:16] all we want is for the dog to exit the [10:18] end of the tumble [10:20] and glance over at the handler to get [10:22] directions where they're going next [10:24] but right now all we're trying to do is [10:25] build speed and confidence [10:27] speed confidence motivation now would we [10:29] start turning it [10:30] now we'd turn it where the dog cannot [10:32] see through it would we do a large turn [10:34] or maybe just a small amount to get the [10:37] dog started [10:38] you could argue a small amount might be [10:40] better however [10:42] generally we make enough of a turn that [10:46] the dog cannot see through it [10:49] okay so when we were first teaching the [10:51] dog if there was a brand new dog [10:54] we might just do something like that [10:55] right right yeah and then as the dog [10:57] gets better [10:58] we continue to turn success builds more [11:01] success most dogs [11:02] really don't seem to have much problem [11:04] with the tunnel turning [11:06] okay next step is she can move the dog [11:08] further away from the entrance because [11:09] by now the dog [11:11] understands the exercise we've added a [11:13] little bit of turn through it [11:15] and she can do the same thing with the [11:16] ball the first few times okay go ahead [11:25] again he's going through very fast and [11:27] we want to [11:28] build this exercise with speed so what [11:30] you're talking about is basically [11:32] we start off with each individual [11:34] obstacle as an individual obstacle but [11:36] then when you're starting to look at the [11:37] whole picture [11:38] you want to make sure that the dog's [11:39] looking at the handler because the [11:40] handler is going to have to direct the [11:42] dog which obstacle to do next correct [11:44] because one of the disqualifying factors [11:46] if i'm remembering correctly is [11:48] if a dog does an obstacle out of order [11:50] while competing [11:52] it's a disqualification right right yeah [11:54] and [11:55] what we push our students to be able to [11:58] do [11:58] would be to stand in the middle of the [12:00] room and say dog walk and the dog would [12:02] do it [12:03] a-frame dog will do it total the dog [12:05] would do it [12:07] that way the handler is going to slow [12:10] the dog down in many cases because the [12:11] dog can easily outrun the handler [12:13] if they do they could go the wrong way [12:15] and then get disqualified [12:16] so if we can name each one of the [12:19] obstacles [12:20] do it enough repetitions that understand [12:22] some names [12:23] then the handler can stay more towards [12:26] the middle of the course [12:28] and avoid slowing the dog down perfect [12:31] so some of the takeaways i think for the [12:33] tunnel is we want to start with it as [12:35] small as possible to make it easy for [12:37] the dog to learn [12:38] as the dog is progressing and they're [12:40] building confidence we can increase the [12:41] length of the tunnel [12:42] using a reward to increase speed so [12:45] they're doing it very quickly with high [12:46] motivation and confidence [12:47] and then slowly starting to turn the [12:49] tunnel until the dog is able to do it [12:52] and then finally we want to make sure [12:53] when the dog completes the exercise [12:55] they look back at the handler for that [12:56] guidance for the next exercise [12:58] i might mention a problem solver that we [13:00] see often [13:01] if you go too fast with this exercise [13:04] which is often the case then [13:06] you end up with a situation where the [13:08] dog gets halfway through the tunnel [13:10] turns around and comes back now what you [13:13] can do you can have a helper [13:15] simply flip [13:19] the tunnel down it'd have to retract a [13:22] little bit [13:23] but all they can do is that and they can [13:25] prevent the dog from being able to come [13:27] back to teach him no he shouldn't do [13:29] that [13:29] but if you took the time to do it right [13:31] using the long line you shouldn't have [13:32] to fix this problem [13:34] that's an excellent point though because [13:35] i've seen that as well they get halfway [13:37] through and they go uh-oh and they go [13:38] back [13:39] so we want to make sure they're going [13:40] through the entire tunnel and not [13:42] turning around because that could also [13:44] be a problem with it [13:44] that's usually a result of not using the [13:46] long line or going too fast [13:49] to help them or they didn't want to do [13:50] it they couldn't see the need [13:52] i hope you guys enjoyed today's episode [13:54] please let me know you

The school he founded is the culmination of that passion, and their students and graduates share his dedication. Over the past four decades, TRS graduated a major percentage of the foremost trainers in the world. Employers snap up at their alumni.  Those who start their own businesses succeed consistently. One very successful graduate put it this way,  “There is no other school with the experience and instructional track record of TRS. There is no other school that teaches many different training techniques, then encourages the student to choose the methods most comfortable for them."" Tom authored three major dog-training books. He won training competitions time after time with dogs he raised and trained. He pioneered and developed the celebrated Puppy Imprinting Program. He coined the phrase ""imprinting"" as it applies to dogs.  He is the first to import the Belgian Malinois breed to the United States. Graduation from TRS depends upon successfully accomplishing industry-recognized objectives and requirements. The Tom Rose School curriculum is proven effective in meeting and exceeding those requirements."

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 220/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another episode this is [00:02] the third episode in a series of three [00:04] for our agility training [00:06] i'm back at the tom rose school and [00:08] we're gonna be going over [00:09] jumps let's get started [00:15] okay in teaching the tire jump the [00:17] biggest problem [00:18] that people incur with a puppy is [00:21] the puppy will go around and grow [00:24] through here [00:25] or if it's a little bit higher it'll [00:26] simply crawl under it [00:28] we want him to jump through it in fact [00:30] we talk about [00:32] not allowing any mistakes to occur [00:35] during our training [00:36] so we want to prevent mistakes by the [00:38] way we set up our props [00:40] in this case we're going to use this [00:42] device which is a flexi lead [00:45] and the idea is we can [00:48] pass that through the tire we can have [00:51] the helper over here [00:53] and then when the handler tells the dog [00:56] to jump [00:58] i can take in the [01:01] slack as the dog is coming and then once [01:05] they're through i can let them come on [01:06] to me or [01:08] you can command them to do something [01:10] different but the main thing is [01:12] this has a very light tension it kind of [01:14] guides the puppy [01:15] and it's an easy way to prevent a [01:17] problem if the pipey would go around i [01:19] can simply lock it [01:20] and then the handler can go and take [01:22] care of the problem [01:24] okay let's go ahead and try it once and [01:25] that's a key detail that i remembered [01:27] from you teaching when i came through [01:29] the school to always minimize mistakes [01:31] so if your dog doesn't make any mistakes [01:33] during training because you take the [01:34] proper steps like tom's explaining right [01:36] now [01:36] then you're not going to run into issues [01:38] in the future and it's going to make the [01:39] whole training process significantly [01:41] easier [01:41] right so take the time to do the [01:43] additional steps in the beginning it is [01:45] worth your while trust you asked a [01:46] minute ago about [01:47] how many reps would you do of an [01:49] exercise i would do as many [01:52] reps as it takes to never having a [01:54] mistake [01:55] yes everything is right in the case of a [01:57] halt with a set [01:58] when they're all perfectly straight then [02:00] i'm ready to move on to something else [02:02] but i don't want to quit until i have it [02:04] correct [02:05] right so she's hooking her dog up [02:08] now with a puppy you could have a [02:10] handler hold the dog [02:13] now she's going to leave her dog and [02:15] come over to me [02:18] and grab the flexi and now [02:22] she can guide the dog through the jump [02:26] [Applause] [02:29] and she could throw a ball if she wanted [02:31] to [02:32] sometimes throwing a ball when a dealing [02:34] with jumps will cause the dog to strike [02:37] the jumps [02:37] because they're going too fast they're [02:39] not jumping correctly [02:41] and they smash through things so if you [02:43] can would you prefer to use [02:46] food as a reward on this exercise [02:47] probably would be easier but [02:49] if in the effort of trying to get speed [02:51] most people want to use a toy [02:53] right so would it be okay for her to [02:56] hand me the flexi and i go to the other [02:57] side or do you want to bring the dog [02:58] back around [02:59] and start in the same starting point [03:01] that we did from the back i usually [03:02] always teach one way [03:04] so they don't make the mistake of [03:06] wanting to go back and that's probably [03:08] overthinking it [03:09] like you said before if we minimize [03:11] mistakes right [03:12] you know exactly why i do it during a [03:15] test or trial they can't jump through [03:17] and go back so [03:19] i think that's an excellent point and [03:22] worth mentioning [03:29] he's looking for his ball but you see [03:32] that he bumped the jump that time [03:34] he went because he was anticipating the [03:36] reward because of the ball yeah [03:39] so should we bring him back around do it [03:40] again i'll hold the leash and then she [03:42] comes around and grabs it from me again [03:43] so we can prevent him from turning to [03:45] the side [03:47] and that was because he wanted to get [03:48] the toy right [03:51] so that's something i've talked about in [03:52] my videos as well reward placement [03:55] where the dog is anticipating the reward [03:57] it could determine what the dog does so [04:00] like a big example i run into clients [04:01] when i'm working with them [04:02] they're doing a come when called and [04:04] they reward the dog off to the side [04:06] right well that teaches the dog to come [04:08] into their side [04:09] instead of center position so keep [04:10] reward placement in mind when you're [04:12] training your dog sometimes toy rewards [04:14] can [04:15] cause more trouble than they say i've [04:17] noticed that as well [04:18] on occasions but like you said it does [04:20] increase the speed so it is an excellent [04:22] tool [04:22] oh yeah [04:27] so would she throw it or do you think it [04:28] would be better for her to do a couple [04:30] more repetitions she throws it it's [04:31] liable to run out of range of the flexi [04:36] so then throwing it would be nice if she [04:38] did throw it i'd throw it [04:39] this way rather than this way to because [04:42] keep the dog away from her [04:44] and that's something that she would want [04:45] to start when there's no need for [04:48] a helper standing on the other side of [04:49] that we could actually do that step [04:51] we could go ahead the dog's going [04:52] through it reliably now [04:54] so we take the flexi off take the dog [04:58] back again [05:00] now this time she'll throw the dog [05:04] towards the kitchen area over there okay [05:08] tired okay now she's a little bit laid [05:11] on the throw [05:12] you'd like to throw when the dog's feet [05:15] are in the air [05:18] you don't want to throw before because [05:20] the dog might miss [05:21] right and cause crooked yeah so let's [05:24] try it one more time [05:25] but throw while the dog's in the air [05:30] that was better uh and he pretty much [05:34] didn't strike the jump then when we go [05:36] to the jumping chute we're going to be [05:37] adding speed once again [05:39] but we just want to get it correct [05:41] before we move on to the next step [05:43] and with a dog like this they're going [05:44] to have to jump with the tire higher [05:47] so we would slowly start bringing it up [05:49] yeah maybe we should do that [05:50] once just [05:55] now with this step once you start [05:57] raising it [05:58] would you want to go back and do a [06:00] couple with the flexi to make sure the [06:01] dog jumps [06:02] it probably would be a good idea [06:05] and so this one i'll feed it to her [06:06] she'll hook the dog up she'll come [06:08] around she'll grab the flexi from me do [06:10] a couple making sure that she's having [06:11] the dog jump through [06:12] and then we would move back to the step [06:14] that we did before again you're blocking [06:15] with sex [06:16] okay if the dog went around the jump [06:20] around the tire [06:21] now they were thinking now we got this [06:23] to deal with [06:25] it's a lot easier to prevent mistakes [06:27] and fix mistakes that's for sure [06:38] and of course you know her dog has done [06:40] this exercise before [06:41] but for anyone else they're going to [06:43] want to do tons of repetitions of this [06:46] even before they move on to the next [06:47] step and like you said the dog should be [06:49] doing it where you're not [06:50] having to help anymore right but you [06:51] still have it there in case you do need [06:53] to help so like right there she didn't [06:54] have to help at all [06:55] he jumped came right to her excellent so [06:58] then we could try it [06:59] at that point without the flexi yeah [07:01] okay now she's [07:02] the dog it ideally would glance at you [07:05] as soon as it finishes the jump [07:07] and then chase the ball away from you [07:09] okay which he did last time [07:16] you can catch it now if she was [07:20] to do exactly what she did and her [07:23] timing was a little bit off [07:24] the dog could very easily try to come [07:26] back to her which we don't want [07:28] we want the dog to stay in the path [07:31] so to speak so they're getting ready for [07:33] the next obstacle but they're still [07:34] looking for guidance so in her case she [07:36] could have thrown the ball a little [07:37] earlier before the dog actually bent [07:39] towards her so let's do one [07:40] where we throw it again when the dog's [07:42] in the air [07:48] tire much better at that time [07:52] that one was excellent so then you would [07:54] continue to do this make sure that doing [07:56] the dog's doing it correctly and then if [07:57] you wanted to you could add this to the [08:00] jump shoot which we're going to do next [08:01] right yeah all right perfect good okay [08:04] this is how we [08:05] begin teaching jumping to puppies [08:09] growing dogs of any age for that matter [08:11] we call it a jumping chute [08:13] and the jumps are spaced out should be [08:16] according to the length of the dog's [08:18] body [08:18] in most cases we put them eight feet [08:20] apart [08:21] and generally don't have any trouble [08:23] with puppies and other dogs going [08:25] through it [08:26] but we have a line of jumps and the idea [08:29] is to have the dog jumping off lead [08:33] and free and able to work out his steps [08:37] between jumps so he doesn't strike the [08:39] jumps [08:40] and by doing this we can raise the [08:43] height of the jumps [08:45] as we progress through the training to [08:47] where the dog [08:48] either bounces and jumps and bounces and [08:51] jumps or takes a step and jumps [08:53] but go through the whole procedure [08:55] without striking [08:56] and clearing each jump [09:00] the reason we started doing this is [09:03] originally [09:04] my wife is having trouble with the dog [09:06] that she won several championships with [09:08] and the dog had struck jumps [09:12] at schutz in competition and hit her [09:14] knees [09:15] and hurt her knees and the more she got [09:17] hurt the more she was reluctant to jump [09:20] and we were able to work through it but [09:22] the way we did it [09:23] was setting up this jumping chute [09:25] because [09:26] especially and shuts it in some sports [09:29] the jumps are made out of two by [09:31] material which is very heavy [09:33] and if the dog hits it that's easy for [09:35] them to injure themselves [09:37] so by doing this the dog gets confident [09:39] free they're not hitting anything that's [09:41] hurting [09:42] and they learn how to time their their [09:44] jumping much like a [09:45] track and field human running [09:48] would do high hurdles and has to work [09:52] out the steps between each [09:53] to get this best speed without hitting [09:56] the hurdles [09:57] so this is our setup right here we have [09:59] ring gates we have the wall there that [10:01] way the dog can't necessarily [10:02] avoid the jump um as you can see the [10:05] jumps are actually [10:06] low they're not up high we only have one [10:07] bar down um it teaches them to actually [10:09] jump over it instead of just [10:11] you know hitting it on the way through [10:13] we also have the jump spaced out quite a [10:15] bit [10:16] that way the dog has time to think about [10:18] its jump before it does it [10:20] at the end here we have a tire um i [10:22] would recommend that you practice the [10:24] tire without the jump shoot before you [10:25] actually put it in the jump shoot okay [10:27] all right guys so let's go ahead and [10:28] grab the puppies [10:53] next step ben you're going to take the [10:54] leash off rock you hold the dog [10:58] and then you'll run through the leash [11:01] actually confuses the dog and causes [11:03] them to hit often [11:04] okay rock you want to hold the dog [11:15] come on good okay all the way hit one [11:20] up [11:27] second part would be for you to run down [11:30] there [11:30] right i'm gonna hold your dog there and [11:31] then you'll send it okay okay [11:37] thank you [11:55] come on there we go thanks again for [11:58] watching everyone i hope you enjoyed [11:59] today's episode remember [12:01] dog training is supposed to be fun we'll

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 228/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode today we are going to be going [00:03] over the training that we like to do for [00:04] the canine good citizens test [00:06] if you want to learn more about the tom [00:07] rose school or if you want to become a [00:09] professional dog trainer [00:10] the information is going to be in the [00:12] description below if you want to do a [00:14] private session with me whether in [00:15] person or [00:16] zoom the information for that will be [00:18] there as well i hope you guys enjoyed [00:20] today's episode [00:21] let's get started the k9 citizen test is [00:24] a 10 skill training program that is open [00:26] to all breeds [00:28] that focuses on teaching the basics of [00:30] good manners [00:31] and obedience it instills the values of [00:34] a responsible dog [00:35] owner and strengthens the bond between [00:37] you and your dog at home [00:39] as well as out in the community so let's [00:41] go ahead and get started [00:43] okay so one of the things we always want [00:45] to keep in mind when we're training our [00:46] dogs is [00:47] dogs are very situational if we have a [00:49] dog and we want that dog to perform a [00:50] certain way when something happens [00:52] then we have to rehearse it that's one [00:54] of the main things of training for the [00:56] cgc [00:56] and a lot of you are probably going to [00:58] become evaluators and you're going to be [00:59] testing people and working with them [01:01] to get them to accomplish the exact same [01:03] thing okay so the very first thing is [01:05] accepting a friendly stranger [01:06] now one of the most common mistakes that [01:08] everybody makes when it comes to [01:09] training their dogs is what [01:11] it's something i've been saying the [01:12] whole time i've been here [01:15] pairing pairing your physical with your [01:17] verbal if you're doing any sort of [01:19] physical cue for your dog [01:20] it doesn't matter what it is make sure [01:22] something comes before it [01:23] so it could become a predictable pattern [01:25] for your dog so like we were talking [01:27] about earlier when everybody's giving a [01:28] little tug [01:29] and these little cues to their dog if [01:31] you add a verbal before it at least now [01:33] the dog's going to respond on a verbal [01:35] and not the actual leash the leash is a [01:37] tool to teach what it is we want the [01:38] dogs to understand and perform [01:40] so for this exercise we're going to be [01:42] coming up to you guys shaking your hand [01:44] and we want the dog to stay [01:46] in a calm relaxed state the thing that's [01:48] going to get you to fail the cgc is [01:50] if your dog is acting fearful if your [01:52] dog is acting aggressive or if you're [01:54] having to put a significant amount of [01:55] force on your dog to get them to perform [01:57] a behavior [01:58] but since we're training if you need to [01:59] apply any sort of correction [02:01] you can go ahead and do that but again [02:03] make sure your marker comes before the [02:05] correction or whatever it is that you're [02:06] doing [02:07] so be very aware of that so we're both [02:09] going to walk up and we're going to come [02:10] shake everybody's hands [02:12] focus on your dog right now don't focus [02:14] on us focus on your dog because if your [02:16] dog makes a mistake i want you guys to [02:18] be able to fix it [02:19] so we're just going to come up and shake [02:20] everybody's hands and we're talking [02:22] the same way we would as if you were on [02:24] the street meeting somebody else what's [02:25] up man [02:26] the moment your dog makes a mistake if [02:28] your dog doesn't make a mistake [02:30] make sure you stay whatever your marker [02:32] is or whatever the command you want them [02:33] to be in [02:34] and then follow it up with the physical [02:36] cue okay [02:37] so we're gonna do it again how you doing [02:39] you're doing well everything's good [02:40] we're having a good time coming back [02:42] through what's up buddy cool [02:43] cool what's happening make sure you're [02:44] watching your dog if they make a mistake [02:46] during testing they're gonna want you to [02:49] look at the person who's coming up and [02:50] greeting you but right now since we're [02:51] training the number one focus has to be [02:53] on the dogs [02:54] we're gonna come back through and do it [02:56] one more time make sure you're watching [02:57] your dog [02:58] very nice excellent you have a cute dog [03:00] there thank you how long have you had [03:02] your dog [03:02] oh too long that's such a sweet little [03:05] puppy [03:06] people will do that stuff right let's go [03:08] down the entire line [03:09] and another big thing about training [03:11] dogs is the concept of desensitization i [03:13] really like it [03:15] anybody knows [03:21] as much as we can expose them to [03:22] something we're going to do that because [03:24] right now [03:24] if your dog never gets used to somebody [03:26] coming up and shaking your hand [03:28] while they're in the heel position then [03:30] the first time it happens [03:32] they're going to want to break the [03:33] position because they're not used to it [03:35] that's a very very simple exercise [03:38] just because you're doing it here inside [03:39] of the training building doesn't mean [03:41] that if you take your dog outside and do [03:43] the exact same thing that it's going to [03:44] work [03:44] we have to make sure we get our dogs [03:46] generalized to the training but yeah so [03:48] they know like okay if i'm doing the [03:49] obedience inside it doesn't just apply [03:51] here [03:51] it also applies outside it applies if [03:54] i'm at the store [03:56] it doesn't matter where i am the dog [03:57] understands that they have to follow [03:58] through so very first exercise [04:00] very simple any questions all right easy [04:03] enough [04:04] okay so now rocky is gonna go over the [04:06] second step of the cgc [04:08] alrighty guys so the second test in the [04:10] cgc [04:11] is sitting politely for petting okay so [04:13] what i'm going to do is walk over [04:15] ask you if i can pet your dog and then [04:17] what i'm going to do is run my hand [04:18] across the head and the back end [04:19] so for those of you who are struggling [04:21] with this concept right [04:23] what you can do is have whoever is going [04:24] to compete your dog hold their hand out [04:26] with a treat like this right [04:28] and then have them run their hand over [04:29] and then pet while they're feeding okay [04:31] so quick example of that would be hello [04:34] how's it going [04:34] can i pet your dog real quick of course [04:36] awesome [04:38] so just like that right [04:42] awesome so does anybody have a dog that [04:44] is a little bit [04:45] uncomfortable or unsure about new people [04:47] petting so we have one over there so [04:50] rocky is going to come up and do the [04:51] same thing with her hello [04:53] can i pet your dog awesome [05:02] should i correct that no so right now we [05:04] wouldn't want you to correct [05:05] right now mainly because of the fact we [05:07] wouldn't want to create [05:08] fear with this situation so if we were [05:11] to correct her [05:12] while he's petting and working with her [05:14] on this then it could make her afraid of [05:15] somebody coming and petting which would [05:17] have the exact opposite effect of what [05:18] we're trying to do [05:20] so we want to make her comfortable so a [05:22] lot of times when we're training our [05:23] dogs we break [05:24] everything down into the smallest pieces [05:25] possible and then we put them together [05:27] for the final pitcher [05:29] good job so i'm gonna see if i can do [05:31] the same thing with her is that okay [05:34] can i get a treat and i know she like [05:36] she knows you a little bit better than [05:38] she knows me [05:38] so let's see how she does with me so i'm [05:40] also going to try to get down on her [05:41] level to reduce the amount of stress [05:43] possible so i'm going to come down feed [05:45] her good girl [05:47] so she's now more focused on my hand [05:49] there we go very nice [05:51] again i'm just trying to create a very [05:53] strong positive association [05:55] for her being pet by somebody new [05:57] because she's eating a treat she's [05:58] enjoying herself this is a nice pleasant [06:00] experience [06:01] and that's what we want and when you are [06:03] testing [06:04] the dog is allowed to move their head in [06:08] order to receive the pet [06:09] but they're not allowed to move forward [06:11] and jump up on the person and try to [06:12] gain [06:13] affection or attention from them but [06:15] since we're coming down at her level [06:17] and we're giving her the food and then [06:18] we're petting her she's learning like oh [06:20] just relax i get a nice little treat [06:22] this is a nice pleasant experience [06:24] and this is the first step right of [06:27] course [06:27] when you're testing you're not going to [06:28] be able to do that so we want to get the [06:30] dog more and more comfortable with [06:31] people coming up and petting her [06:33] so you're going to want a lot of [06:34] different people to do this so then she [06:35] can become generalized [06:36] and then you're going to want to have [06:38] them do the same thing without the treat [06:39] so it's going to be a little bit of a [06:40] process [06:41] to get to the point where she's really [06:42] comfortable because again if your dog is [06:45] showing signs of fearfulness or [06:46] aggression [06:47] that's going to be a fail so you really [06:49] have to work through that [06:51] all right so everybody else if your dog [06:53] is good and comfortable [06:54] your main focus is to make sure your dog [06:56] doesn't break okay and we're going to [06:58] come up and add distractions if your dog [07:00] does break the position [07:01] calmly say your marker calmly adjust [07:04] your dog back into the correct position [07:05] good dog and we'll try it again so this [07:08] is something you're going to want to [07:08] work on of course using the food is just [07:11] a tool to get your dogs to where they [07:13] need to be again any tool that we use [07:15] should be a means to an end [07:17] the leash is there to help us train the [07:18] dog the training collars are there to [07:20] help us train the dog the food [07:22] etc so just like everything we have to [07:24] build the dogs up [07:26] up until the point where they're [07:26] successful and you're able to have [07:28] people come pet your dog and they're not [07:29] even worried about [07:30] it another interesting exercise that you [07:32] can do with this [07:33] is keep the dog's focus on you which a [07:35] lot of you have been doing [07:36] and then as the person comes into pet if [07:38] the dog looks away [07:40] the reward stops the dog looks back you [07:42] reward again so we really get them [07:43] looking so i'll demonstrate with you [07:44] right now [07:45] because your dog's looking at you really [07:46] nicely so keep your dog looking i'm [07:48] going to come up to the side once he [07:49] looks back mark and reward [07:52] and then i'm going to bring my hand down [07:53] when he looks at you again mark and [07:54] reward [07:56] and i'm going to bring my hand a little [07:57] closer let's not have him smell it put [07:59] him back there we go [08:01] if he tries to smell keep him looking at [08:03] you [08:05] excellent very nice and then i'm going [08:07] to pet again [08:08] good good that was good your marker was [08:11] timed nicely [08:14] and it's the head pet that always makes [08:16] it difficult [08:17] there we go good so that's good [08:19] excellent [08:21] all right so easy enough are we ready [08:23] for step three yes we are [08:25] any questions on the sit for petting [08:28] so we know how to work on it we want to [08:29] have like you guys can set this up where [08:31] one of you sit with your dog and [08:32] everybody rotates through [08:34] and then you rotate each person so your [08:35] dog gets really used to people coming up [08:37] and petting [08:37] and it's not seen as a big deal for them [08:39] anymore and again for testing [08:41] your dog has to sit nicely not jump [08:44] forward [08:45] not try to demand affection and not show [08:47] any signs of aggression or fear so [08:49] we're going to come down with the brush [08:51] just like what we did with the petting [08:52] the main thing if you need to fix your [08:54] dog go in and fix them [08:55] they're allowed to move they're allowed [08:56] to stand they're allowed to sit [08:58] so this is a pretty easy exercise as [09:00] long as you don't have a fearful or [09:01] aggressive dog [09:04] it's two to move away so i'm gonna go [09:06] ahead and start i don't want her i feel [09:07] like she's stuck [09:08] so i would go ahead and reward her since [09:09] she's very interested in the area okay [09:11] okay [09:12] or he's very interested in me good [09:19] okay i'm gonna go ahead and check the [09:20] ears you want me to continue feeding all [09:23] day i would [09:24] i would caesar good [09:28] so a lot of that good job any questions [09:31] on this exercise [09:33] it's very simple it's just like the [09:34] first two we're just adding a couple [09:36] more things [09:37] if your dog is again a little bit [09:38] cautious like yours we're going to want [09:40] to have everybody [09:41] petting her working with her and just [09:43] getting her comfortable with people [09:44] approaching her [09:45] and make sure anytime somebody is [09:46] helping you with this that they're [09:48] moving very very slow [09:50] so speed if you're moving very quick [09:52] with a dog that is cautious or fearful [09:55] it's not good it's going to make them [09:57] more fearful so we want to move [09:59] very very slowly with dogs that are [10:01] cautious okay any questions on that [10:03] exercise [10:04] again the key things the key takeaway is [10:06] if you need to [10:07] if you're going to adjust your dog [10:09] remember with this exercise the dog's [10:11] allowed to stand up [10:12] sit down lay down they're allowed to [10:14] move around in that position [10:16] and you're allowed to talk to them as [10:18] much as you like [10:19] so during training if you have to use a [10:22] marker [10:22] again make sure you follow through with [10:24] which whatever the marker predicts [10:25] because again [10:26] in order for a marker to be a marker it [10:28] has to predict what [10:31] one of the four quadrants of opera [10:32] conditioning so positive or negative [10:34] punishment positive or negative [10:36] reinforcement [10:37] okay cool all right guys so the next [10:39] test that we're going to go over [10:40] is called out for a walk this test just [10:43] demonstrates that you guys [10:44] have control over your dog when walking [10:46] out in public okay so the way that's [10:48] going to look is you're going to start [10:49] off by [10:50] walking right doing a left turn [10:53] right halt continue walking again [10:57] make a right turn an about turn [11:02] and then halt [11:05] simple enough if you prefer to be walked [11:08] through it the evaluator can walk you [11:10] through [11:10] as well either option is fine so if you [11:13] want to be walked through we can walk [11:14] you through [11:15] also the dog can be on your left or [11:17] right side your dog does not have to sit [11:19] when you halt but if you want to work on [11:21] getting your dog to do the ultimate exit [11:23] feel free to do that and you can talk to [11:26] your dog as much as you like but since [11:28] all you guys are training for advanced [11:30] competition obedience [11:31] i would recommend treating this the same [11:33] way as if you're training for the [11:35] you know akc novice or igp but keep in [11:38] mind when you become evaluators [11:40] your clients don't have to so what i [11:42] used to tell my clients [11:43] is i would tell them you could even do [11:46] this the entire time like [11:47] you don't even have to walk straight so [11:49] keep this in mind when you have your own [11:50] clients i would tell them you could walk [11:52] and talk to your dog like this so [11:53] imagine the same path [11:54] that rocky just went over come on get [11:56] buddy good boy nice job oh that's a good [11:59] boy you're so good [12:00] look at you go oh that's such a good dog [12:03] look at you amazing good puppy [12:07] like it doesn't matter you can do all [12:09] that and still pass [12:11] so that's something again keep in mind [12:13] when you guys become evaluators and [12:15] you're working with your clients or [12:16] people who are testing for the canine [12:18] good citizen test [12:19] but for you guys let's work on a little [12:21] bit of that precision as well [12:23] so we'll start at the end and we'll work [12:24] our way down any questions [12:27] sorry did you have any uh notes you want [12:29] to mention as far as the loose leash [12:30] walking points that you've been seeing [12:32] um so if you if your leash does get [12:35] tight let's do a little tension getter [12:36] okay [12:36] is that okay for the video yeah [12:38] absolutely okay since we are training if [12:40] you need to make an adjustment make an [12:42] adjustment [12:42] just make sure if you're going to make [12:44] an adjustment that you say the word that [12:46] predicts the adjustment [12:47] because again if you're not using the [12:49] word then you always need [12:50] to use the leash or you always need to [12:52] use whatever it is [12:53] that you're using because you don't have [12:55] a verbal word that predicts it [12:57] makes sense okay perfect so we're going [12:59] to start with you and we're going to [13:00] work our way down the rest of you could [13:02] be working on a good sit stay [13:03] or down stay whatever it is that you [13:05] want to work on forward [13:09] left turn [13:16] about turn [13:21] right turn [13:32] oh [13:36] exercise finished next make sure you [13:38] guys are working on whatever it is you [13:39] need to work on [13:40] while you're doing your heel you know [13:42] your dog's better than i do also [13:43] something else this is another thing [13:45] that's worth [13:45] keeping in mind it's something i like to [13:47] do with my own dogs so for [13:49] my dogs my personal dogs i have a [13:51] command that means focused heel [13:52] you have to look at me you have to [13:54] maintain focus the entire time i have [13:55] another command that means [13:57] heal but you don't have to look at me [13:59] but you do have to maintain this [14:00] position [14:01] and then i have another command that [14:02] means walk with me [14:04] you're allowed to go wherever you want [14:05] around me as long as you don't [14:07] make the leash tight so if i was doing [14:09] this exercise [14:10] with my dog and i had those three i'd [14:12] probably just use the last one again [14:14] you're all working on your focus deal [14:15] and everything so it's good to be doing [14:16] that [14:16] but in the future keep that in mind so [14:19] same thing with your clients so all my [14:20] clients i teach them two different types [14:22] of loose leash walking [14:23] one where the dog has to maintain a [14:24] really nice position and the other one [14:26] again where the dog can walk wherever [14:27] they want around them [14:28] as long as they're not pulling on the [14:30] leash and that's pretty easy to teach [14:32] once you teach the dogs the more formal [14:34] exercise [14:34] so what i want you to do is you're going [14:36] to come out during this exercise don't [14:38] have your dog on a command [14:40] so what we want to do is we want to [14:41] expose our dogs to this situation [14:43] and we want them to know that anytime [14:45] they see three people just kind of [14:47] standing looking weird [14:49] you know because it's not natural like [14:50] go ahead and stand right here and we're [14:52] all just [14:52] back a little a little bit distance [14:54] because they have to walk through us but [14:55] we're standing here and we're just no [14:58] one does this [14:59] the dogs can pick up on that now if [15:01] we're standing like this and we're [15:02] having a conversation [15:04] that's going to be something the dogs [15:05] used to seeing in [15:07] a normal situation but a lot of times [15:09] when you're testing they'll put people [15:10] in a group like this and we all just [15:12] kind of stand [15:13] so it's very clear that it's a different [15:14] picture to the dog so what i like to do [15:16] for this exercise when i'm teaching the [15:18] dog is i [15:18] have somebody come in so we're going to [15:20] go down the line you're going to come in [15:21] you're going to have your dog on [15:23] just no command just hanging out with [15:24] you walking and you're gonna allow your [15:26] dog to check us out [15:29] do not allow your dog to jump on us [15:30] though we are going to ignore the dogs [15:32] completely we're not gonna have any [15:34] interaction we're just gonna stand there [15:35] if the dog jumps on us it's on you [15:37] to fix your own dog so what i like to do [15:40] for this exercise is [15:41] i just pull the dog off the person so [15:43] i'm not applying a correction i'm not [15:45] doing anything that's going to make the [15:46] dog afraid of people i'm just pulling [15:48] them off [15:48] once all four paws are back on the [15:50] ground then there's no more tension on [15:52] the leash [15:52] and you're gonna allow your dog to check [15:54] us out the idea is the dog has the [15:56] ability to check us out and then the dog [15:58] realizes [15:59] we're boring we're no fun when the dog [16:01] comes back to you [16:03] yeah good puppy you're gonna do a little [16:04] bit of work you're gonna have some fun [16:06] and then if your dog wants to check us [16:07] out again allow it [16:09] again the dog's gonna realize we're [16:10] boring that's the main idea does anyone [16:12] have any questions before you try this [16:14] is it pretty clear okay so you're gonna [16:17] come in again your dog's not gonna be in [16:18] a command [16:19] but you're gonna have your dog in a [16:21] pretty much a loose leash walk [16:23] if they jump up and you need to adjust [16:24] it make sure you do that and we're gonna [16:26] do this until your dog is not even [16:27] interested in us anymore [16:29] and when your dog comes back to you it [16:30] has to be like boom boom you're the fun [16:32] one [16:32] you're the one that your dog wants to [16:33] hang out with not us we suck [16:36] you're the fun one all right so whenever [16:37] you're ready and we're just going to [16:38] stand here and completely ignore what [16:40] you're doing [16:44] and you can train your dog around us you [16:46] can give them treats you can do sits if [16:47] you want [16:55] whatever your dog enjoys [17:00] and since you guys have been doing some [17:01] really nice training with your dogs this [17:02] is [17:03] he doesn't even care about us already [17:09] all right perfect well you can head back [17:11] that was easy enough [17:12] so his dog showed no interest in us at [17:15] all and that's actually what we want so [17:16] if all your dogs are already doing that [17:18] this is going to be super easy so [17:20] whenever you're ready [17:37] and depending on the evaluator they may [17:39] have the people who are standing here [17:40] move [17:41] you know like do a little bit of this or [17:43] something or they just might have them [17:45] stand [17:45] so each evaluator might be a little bit [17:47] different but i always like to start [17:49] where the people are still [17:50] we're not doing anything and then as the [17:51] dogs get better at it so like your dog [17:53] is [17:53] totally ready for us to do this stuff [17:56] and move around [17:57] same with yours your dog is doing really [17:59] nice as well [18:00] all right you can head back [18:04] this is going smoother than i thought [18:06] any questions on this one [18:08] all right you ready for the next [18:09] exercise cool all right guys so the next [18:11] test that we're gonna go over [18:13] is sits and downs and staying on command [18:15] okay so the way this test is gonna work [18:17] you're gonna ask your dog to sit right [18:19] and then after that you're gonna ask [18:21] your dog to down [18:22] and then after that you're gonna pick [18:23] one of the two and you're gonna ask your [18:25] dog to stay [18:25] and then you're gonna walk out to the [18:27] end of this line and your dog is [18:29] expected to stay there and as soon as [18:30] you walk out to the end of this line [18:32] you're going to return back to your dog [18:34] you can either return back to the front [18:36] of them [18:36] or the side of them right and then [18:38] afterwards you'll release your dog and [18:39] exercise will be finished okay [18:42] any questions if you do need to [18:45] recommand for any of this stuff that is [18:47] a-okay [18:48] so everybody go ahead and put your dog [18:50] into a sit [18:54] go ahead and put your dog into it down [19:01] so at this point what i'm going to ask [19:02] you guys to do is [19:04] everybody should have their own 20 foot [19:06] long line at this point [19:07] you're going to attach the 20 foot long [19:09] line take the six foot long line off [19:11] right and then we're gonna ask you to do [19:12] is walk out to the end of your leash [19:14] once you're at the end of your leash you [19:16] can return back to your dogs either in [19:18] the front or the side [19:21] is everyone ready all right whenever [19:24] you're ready go ahead and leave your dog [19:25] walk out to your imaginary 20-foot long [19:27] line [19:29] if your dog does break go back make the [19:32] adjustments that are necessary for your [19:34] dog where they are in training [19:36] and when you get to the end go ahead and [19:38] return [19:42] if so a big part of training which i [19:44] talked to you guys about before is [19:45] pattern training [19:46] so what i want you guys to do right now [19:48] get in position do not release your dog [19:50] i want you to walk back out and back [19:52] again so a lot of times if your dog [19:53] thinks oh you're going to go out one [19:54] time and once you're back you're going [19:56] to release me [19:56] then they're going to anticipate it so [19:58] we're going to walk out and we're going [20:00] to walk back again [20:01] make sure while you're training as [20:02] you're walking away you have eyes on [20:04] your dog the entire time [20:11] and if you want you could even walk back [20:13] and go back just show your dog we always [20:15] want to show our dog different pictures [20:17] sometimes i like to get in front of the [20:19] dogs and start dancing maybe i [20:21] maybe i'll squat down and look at the [20:22] dog right and since we're training we [20:25] want to add as much as we can to ensure [20:26] that we're going to be successful on [20:27] test day and again make sure you have [20:28] eyes [20:29] on while we're testing because if he [20:30] breaks and you don't see it [20:32] you miss the window you missed that [20:33] opportunity and whenever you guys are [20:35] ready whenever you want to you can go [20:37] back and release your dog [20:38] and the exercise will be finished but [20:40] it's up to you i want you guys to work [20:42] whatever you feel like working right now [20:43] okay the next exercise is a come when [20:45] called this one's very simple [20:47] i'm sure you guys have been working on [20:49] your recalls so if you haven't been [20:50] working on your recalls you know what [20:52] you all have [20:53] this is going to be those at home when [20:55] we start off remember when we start the [20:56] recalls we start really close [20:58] and we build our dogs up and we [20:59] gradually add more distance [21:01] whether you're using luring or you're [21:03] using the leash as a cue to help or [21:05] you're using attention getters [21:06] we all know the steps that we need to [21:08] take in order to get become one called [21:10] now [21:10] if you want to use a formal command [21:12] remember we have formal commands and we [21:14] have informal commands what's the [21:15] difference between the two [21:17] any ideas all right so a formal command [21:21] your dog has to do it so if you stand in [21:23] front of your dog and you give them a [21:25] formal [21:25]  or whatever you use that you're [21:27] going to be testing for novice and igp [21:29] in these different obedience routines [21:31] that's formal so if you give your dog a [21:33] formal command they have to do it [21:35] either they have to do it or you have to [21:37] make sure they do it [21:38] if you give them an informal command if [21:41] they don't do it it's not a big deal [21:42] because it's informal this is like what [21:44] i tell my clients all the time like if [21:45] you're inside your house and you want [21:47] your dog to come to you [21:48] but you don't want to reinforce [21:49] something in case they don't don't do it [21:51] then use informal so for me i use it all [21:53] the time i tell my dogs okay come on [21:54] guys [21:54] let's go let's go good puppies come on [21:57] that's informal [21:58] because if they don't come to that it's [21:59] not like i'm standing in front of them [22:00] going come [22:01] because if they choose to ignore that [22:03] now i have to go no and now i have to [22:05] reinforce it [22:06] so if your dog has a very good informal [22:09] come when called [22:10] you can do that on this exercise you can [22:12] walk to the end [22:13] and you can get there and you can be [22:14] like yeah [22:16] and praise your dog till they come to [22:17] you that's acceptable so it's whatever [22:19] you want to work on if you want to work [22:20] on the more formal [22:22] work on it but if your dog chooses not [22:23] to come to you make sure you're ready to [22:25] reinforce the expectations [22:26] so you're going to walk out 10 feet and [22:28] we'll just say [22:30] i mean 10 feet is about right here right [22:33] it's pretty short short distance so [22:36] you're going to walk out [22:37] approximately 10 feet turn and face your [22:39] dog call your dogs to you [22:41] whenever you're ready and you can say [22:44] stay or wait or you can say nothing at [22:46] all [22:47] i prefer not to say anything [22:52] caesar [22:54] beautiful [22:57] all right guys so the next test that [22:59] we're gonna do is reaction to another [23:00] dog [23:01] so what we're gonna do is have one [23:03] handler on this side [23:04] one handler on that side about 20 feet [23:06] apart you guys are gonna [23:08] meet in the middle your dog shouldn't [23:11] show any other type of [23:12] reaction other than mild interest in the [23:14] other dog right gonna walk over [23:16] say hey how's it going right like you're [23:18] meeting somebody in the neighborhood and [23:19] keep it pushing okay and your dogs are [23:21] not allowed to show like over excitement [23:23] any fear aggression or anything like [23:25] that okay just mild interest is all that [23:27] they can do [23:28] all right let's begin so ideally guys i [23:31] would line up [23:32] your dogs are primarily on the left side [23:34] most of you guys right [23:35] i would line up with your dog on the [23:36] left shake hands on the right right [23:38] talk to each other on the right okay all [23:40] right go ahead and give it [23:42] up and during this exercise focus on [23:45] your dog [23:46] all right we'll demonstrate we're both [23:47] we have our dogs we start to approach [23:50] i'm working my dog still so i'm watching [23:52] them right hey how are you [23:54] how you doing are you having good yeah [23:55] beautiful have a nice day see you later [23:57] and then we walk by [23:58] good job so you're gonna say hi hello [24:00] good day goodbye and then you're gonna [24:01] walk off so [24:02] we'll do two quick handshakes all right [24:03] guys is everybody ready [24:05] go ahead and begin [24:14] okay so what you guys can do since that [24:18] is going on i would just go ahead and [24:19] reward [24:20] right carry on with your conversation [24:22] and then try it again okay [24:25] so go ahead and shake hands real quick [24:31] nice scene and shake hands again and [24:32] keep it pushing [24:34] oh yeah she's going to readjust and [24:36] fix it okay all right [24:38] to further advance this um since we have [24:41] multiple dogs i'm going to line three of [24:43] you up down here [24:44] three of you up down there and we're [24:46] gonna go across and do the same thing [24:47] multiple times so [24:48] one will stop hey what's up then go to [24:50] the next person hey what's up [24:52] right and keep going okay so handlers [24:55] should be next to each other dogs should [24:56] be on the outside and go ahead and begin [24:58] okay [25:25] go ahead and say what's up how's the [25:28] weather [25:28] hello exercise finished [25:32] anytime we're doing training we always [25:33] want to make it as easy as possible and [25:35] then make it more difficult as the dog [25:37] gets better [25:38] so a couple of dogs i don't i'm going to [25:42] rephrase that [25:43] so what i'm going to do is i'm going to [25:44] start from far away and i'm going to do [25:46] a drop but i'm not going to drop it all [25:49] the way i'm just going to start i'm [25:50] going to drop it low [25:51] what i want you guys to do is just keep [25:53] rewarding your dogs when they look at [25:54] you [25:55] praise them let them know they're doing [25:56] a good job and i don't want you as the [25:58] humans to do any sort of recognition of [26:00] the chair [26:01] a lot of times our dogs will follow our [26:04] lead they'll feed off of our energy [26:06] so let's say a chair does fall over and [26:08] you go oh what's that [26:09] well then your dog is going to go huh [26:10] what's that right and that's not what we [26:12] want so you're just going to have your [26:13] dog looking you and just keep rewarding [26:14] your dogs [26:15] so i'm going to start with a very low [26:16] drop [26:20] now we're going to bring it all the way [26:22] up [26:25] and hopefully i don't damage the chair [26:26] but now i'm going to drop it even higher [26:32] everyone's doing really nice okay so now [26:35] since they did well with that now i'm [26:36] going to bring it a little bit closer [26:38] and i'm going to start same thing i'm [26:40] going to make it quiet [26:43] and again as long as your dogs are doing [26:44] great if they look at you and you want [26:46] to reward them go ahead and do that [26:47] we're going to make it a little bit [26:50] louder [26:52] we're gonna do the last one [26:56] and everyone did great now i basically [26:58] took the chair back as far as i could [27:00] if you have more distance you can even [27:01] make it a little bit farther and then [27:03] over time you bring it closer and closer [27:05] some dogs if you start right away and [27:07] just drop it right next to them a dog [27:08] that's more skittish [27:09] you can cause more problems because then [27:11] you're now trying to fix something [27:13] that you just created an issue with so [27:15] we always want to start farther away [27:16] and as the dog gets better we bring it [27:19] closer and closer [27:20] so a good example of this outside of [27:22] like a canine good citizen [27:23] is if you're doing for example let's say [27:25] you're doing some training with a police [27:27] department and you have to get the dog [27:29] comfortable with the sound of gunfire [27:31] well we don't want to take a dog and [27:33] fire [27:33] a weapon right next to him day one we [27:35] can make him afraid of it [27:37] we start it very far away we pair it up [27:39] while playing tug with the dog we create [27:41] a positive association [27:42] and over time we bring it closer and [27:44] closer to where it's not even a big deal [27:46] for the dog [27:47] or in fact the dog hears the sound and [27:48] goes oh awesome i'm going to get a treat [27:50] or i'm going to get a toy [27:51] does that make sense same thing when we [27:54] do something with a jogger so we got a [27:55] jogger who's going to help us out [27:57] and what he's going to do you ready to [27:58] do a lot of running he's going to start [28:01] far away and you're gonna do the exact [28:02] same thing that we just did with the [28:03] chair [28:04] if your dog's looking at you you're [28:05] gonna reward them encourage that [28:07] um engagement from your dog and he's [28:10] gonna start and he's basically gonna do [28:11] a zigzag [28:12] and he's gonna get closer and closer [28:14] until he runs right by your dogs [28:16] and the whole time you're keeping your [28:17] dogs focused and you're rewarding them [28:18] for doing what you want them to be doing [28:20] so whenever whenever you're ready get a [28:23] nice good exercise and then you're going [28:25] to do a little turn [28:26] come back and again as long as your dogs [28:29] if they look at you go ahead and reward [28:31] them [28:34] and you're even going to run behind them [28:36] too [28:38] yeah so you're just going to keep going [28:39] back and forth and then you're going to [28:40] do one lap behind them [28:43] approximately four feet behind them [28:46] see you wanted to do some running i got [28:49] you covered [28:51] and then go behind them [28:59] good [29:02] all right that's good thank you [29:06] did any of the dogs struggle with that [29:08] you struggled a little bit [29:09] all right so we're to do the same thing [29:11] instead of trying to avoid it [29:13] what i want you to do is just kind of [29:15] run by them again but i want you to [29:16] start at a slower actually i'll do it [29:18] i'm going to go to slow pace [29:19] so same thing and then i'm going to have [29:21] you do the same thing so now since that [29:22] dog was a little hesitant [29:24] i'm going to run by but i'm going to do [29:25] it slower [29:29] so we can decrease the speed if we need [29:34] make them comfortable with it keep [29:38] rewarding [29:40] all right i'm gonna do a wide one behind [29:42] them [29:50] i'm gonna come right through here [29:57] so if your dog was having any issues [29:59] then you want to work on that [30:00] outside of this exercise so if your dog [30:02] was a little bit hesitant with the chair [30:04] or they seemed a little [30:05] nervous or afraid do it but make sure [30:08] you start again [30:09] at a slower level of a stimuli and as [30:11] the dog gets better you can increase the [30:13] stimuli [30:14] and same thing with your dog if he's [30:16] nervous or uncomfortable with people [30:17] jogging by [30:18] have people do it but have them start [30:20] far away slow pace or gradually get [30:22] closer and closer [30:23] as your dog gets more comfortable with [30:25] it but again if your dog is a little [30:27] nervous [30:27] or afraid of something do not use a [30:30] correction to try to fix it because the [30:32] correction will make it worse [30:34] if a dog is afraid so if i'm a dog and i [30:36] go ah that's scary and then i get a [30:37] correction [30:38] now that just solidifies the fear and [30:40] now it's going to be worse [30:42] so i'll give you a good example i saw a [30:44] video of this on youtube and i felt bad [30:45] for the dogs [30:46] all the dogs were in a down stay and the [30:49] trainer comes out and throws fireworks [30:52] in the center of all the dogs [30:53] the fireworks start going off all the [30:55] dogs are breaking the down stay [30:56] and everybody is yanking their dogs back [30:58] with the prong collar correcting them [31:00] well in that situation the dogs go oh my [31:03] gosh fireworks [31:04] they try to escape the fireworks [31:05] correction fireworks corrections [31:07] fireworks [31:08] now that just made the fireworks 10 [31:09] times worse [31:11] so remember if you do have an issue with [31:13] a dog performing something based on fear [31:16] you want to use the concept of counter [31:17] conditioning and desensitization [31:20] counter conditioning is we take [31:21] something that the dog may think [31:23] predicts something bad and we make it [31:25] predict something nice [31:26] and then desensitization is we gradually [31:29] increase the stimuli we started a [31:31] stimuli so low that it doesn't [31:33] negatively impact the dog [31:34] and then we increase that stimuli as the [31:36] dog becomes more and more confident [31:38] okay guys so for this exercise we're [31:40] going to be doing supervised separation [31:42] what that what that will entail is your [31:45] dog will be either in a sit or [31:46] down doesn't really matter right but [31:48] your dog will have to stay for three [31:50] minutes while you are not in the [31:51] building okay [31:52] so um what will happen is a handler [31:55] either me or whoever else will be [31:57] helping me [31:57] will walk over and say hey now hold on [31:59] to your dog [32:01] you're going to leave the building and [32:02] your dog is expected to sit there nicely [32:04] without excessively panting [32:06] showing any signs of nervousness or [32:07] anything like that okay [32:09] any questions alright let's begin now i [32:12] want to add one thing if you don't mind [32:14] now since we have these windows if you [32:16] want to go ahead and peek through you [32:18] have a couple options one [32:19] if you trust the person that's handling [32:21] your dog you can ask them hey if my dog [32:23] breaks the stay that i leave them in if [32:25] you want to leave your dog in a stay [32:26] that they can reinforce it if you don't [32:28] want to do that and you would prefer to [32:30] reinforce it yourself [32:31] which is not a bad option because then [32:33] the dog's going to go it doesn't matter [32:35] where you are [32:36] you may reinforce something if i'm not [32:37] doing it correctly so you can go outside [32:40] peek through the window since we're [32:41] training [32:42] and if you see your dog break the stay [32:43] you come right on in no [32:45] walk to your dog reinforce it hand the [32:47] leash back off and leave again [32:49] so again because we're training so we [32:50] want to show the dogs these different [32:52] pitchers does that make sense [32:53] so pick whichever option you decide to [32:55] do and let the person who's handling [32:57] your dog know which option you're going [32:58] to be doing [32:59] so you i guess can go with ben right [33:02] i'll go with you tom [33:03] pick whoever you want you can pick [33:05] somebody as well [33:06] and all right cool so we're going to [33:08] come in and grab the leash [33:10] did you want me to reinforce the [33:11] downstay or did you want to come in if [33:13] he's [33:13] okay excellent right now we have the [33:16] students outside for three minutes [33:18] it's a supervised separation during [33:20] testing [33:21] we're not allowed to correct or tell the [33:23] dog what to do but we can't talk to the [33:25] dog [33:25] we can praise them so if i was sitting [33:27] here i could say good job good boy way [33:29] to go [33:29] excellent what the students did was they [33:32] each placed their dog into a down stay [33:34] even though that's not required we find [33:36] that people tend to be more successful [33:38] with their exercise when they tell the [33:40] dog exactly what they want them to do [33:42] so instead of letting the dogs decide [33:44] they tell the dog okay you're going to [33:46] be in a down stay so now the dogs know [33:48] okay i'm going to sit here in this down [33:49] stay easy once they come back in [33:52] we hand the leash back off exercise [33:54] finished [33:55] all right so let's go ahead and call [33:56] them back in [33:59] and that when they come back then they [34:00] can release them right yes okay [34:02] exercise is finished once they come back [34:04] i hope you enjoyed today's video [34:06] please let me know what you think about [34:07] it in the comments below and make sure [34:09] when you are training for this [34:10] take your time make it as fun as [34:12] possible and as always [34:14] remember dog training should be fun i'll [34:16] see you guys in the next one ==================================================

The school he founded is the culmination of that passion, and their students and graduates share his dedication. Over the past four decades, TRS graduated a major percentage of the foremost trainers in the world. Employers snap up at their alumni.  Those who start their own businesses succeed consistently. One very successful graduate put it this way,  “There is no other school with the experience and instructional track record of TRS. There is no other school that teaches many different training techniques, then encourages the student to choose the methods most comfortable for them."" Tom authored three major dog-training books. He won training competitions time after time with dogs he raised and trained. He pioneered and developed the celebrated Puppy Imprinting Program. He coined the phrase ""imprinting"" as it applies to dogs.  He is the first to import the Belgian Malinois breed to the United States. Graduation from TRS depends upon successfully accomplishing industry-recognized objectives and requirements. The Tom Rose School curriculum is proven effective in meeting and exceeding those requirements. Lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on experience guide you to accomplish objectives that would take a talented trainer ten years to learn on their own. We have hundreds of graduates to prove how effective our programs are. They operate successful companies around the world, are top-level employees, they operate/teach at other schools and win championship competitions worldwide. When you compare TRS requirements for graduation, the qualifications and experience of the instructors, and the time established in the industry it is clear why TRS is the only choice."

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 232/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] thanks again for joining us and welcome [00:01] back to another episode [00:03] here at the tom rose school and in [00:04] today's video we are going to be [00:06] teaching our dogs the automatic sit when [00:08] halted [00:09] this is another exercise that you're [00:10] going to see in a lot of different [00:12] competitive obedience routines [00:13] but even if you're just training your [00:15] own dog and you want good solid [00:16] obedience [00:17] pet obedience having an automatic sit [00:19] when halted [00:20] is something that is desired by a lot of [00:22] people and we're going to show you [00:23] exactly how tom rose likes to do it and [00:25] how he likes to teach his students [00:27] here at the tom rose school to be able [00:29] to achieve [00:30] that high score when you're competing so [00:32] let's get started okay [00:34] at this point we've started healing [00:36] we've been through it we showed [00:38] doing the follow with young dogs [00:40] flipping from the follow [00:41] into heel position walking keeping good [00:45] attitude [00:46] if we lose focus from the dog we go [00:48] backwards [00:49] and continue with the follow until we [00:51] get the attitude back [00:52] turn around again we got good focus we [00:54] can continue with healing [00:56] next thing is to develop a nice [01:00] straight quick sit at the handle side [01:02] when they come to a halt [01:04] we've already talked about the [01:07] making the correction upward with the [01:09] leash pushing down on the rear to get [01:11] the dog to sit [01:12] a lot of them already from the puppy [01:14] imprinting don't even need that [01:16] we can do that with the food there's a [01:18] lot of ways we can get them into a sit [01:20] may be able to just tap them in the rear [01:21] and get them to go into a sit [01:23] we want to do this with as little [01:27] negative as we possibly can we would [01:30] like to have as much [01:31] positive in play here to keep the dog [01:33] happy about it [01:34] where he's sitting not because he feels [01:36] that if he doesn't he's going to get [01:39] something that he doesn't want something [01:41] that's uncomfortable [01:42] but instead if he does it he gets [01:44] something he does want which would be [01:46] the food [01:47] or a ball or whatever she's using i [01:49] might mention for a minute about using a [01:51] ball or a toy [01:52] a lot of people like to use it in [01:54] healing i don't [01:56] because what it does it makes the dog [01:58] turn and go crooked [02:00] so if you hold the ball here and you [02:02] heal the dog is liable to wrap around [02:05] you and start bumping your leg [02:07] and also when you do a good performance [02:11] and the dog sits everything looks good [02:13] and you throw it the dog is going to [02:15] have to use energy to go get it it's [02:17] going to tire him out a little bit [02:19] now we got to start over with food i [02:21] always use food with healing [02:23] because i don't have to break my [02:27] maneuver out i don't have to break what [02:29] i'm doing i can hold the food and [02:31] continue to give it to him as i'm [02:33] walking with it [02:34] so it's kind of your choice there's a [02:36] lot of really great trainers [02:38] that would disagree with what i'm saying [02:40] this is my preference [02:41] is to use food rather than a ball i [02:44] think amanda that's going to be [02:45] demonstrating this is going to be using [02:47] a ball [02:48] so our critique would be is her dog [02:50] straight is it sitting straight [02:52] is there anything created by the ball [02:54] that's a problem [02:56] that we made think about training and [02:58] maybe going with food [02:59] which she could easily do because the [03:00] dog is an imprinted puppy [03:02] that is equally happy to get a food or a [03:04] ball but he's more excited [03:06] and more attitude so to speak [03:09] when she uses a ball okay we're going to [03:13] be again healing and when she comes to a [03:17] stop [03:18] ideally we want the dog to sit [03:20] immediately [03:21] without touching her but as close as he [03:23] can be with his [03:25] front feet in line with the balls of her [03:28] feet [03:28] to her heel looking up at her [03:32] with a real quick preferably tucking set [03:35] we also brought that up [03:37] in a previous video you know what [03:40] tucking versus rocking a dog rocks is [03:43] going to scoot back [03:44] and that gives us a problem because we [03:46] have a lagging step [03:47] a dog that tucks is going to always sit [03:49] much straighter [03:50] okay so go ahead and begin healing hold [03:53] maybe [03:55] maybe make it about turn and come around [03:57] and haul over here okay [04:01] okay halt [04:04] okay so she but [04:08] from my perspective he is crooked is his [04:11] healing which you're probably aware of [04:12] okay forward [04:16] okay and halt so the dog's doing a nice [04:21] sit that time it was a fairly straight [04:23] set but it's still crooked with the butt [04:26] out a little bit [04:26] go down to an about turn and come back [04:28] again [04:33] okay [04:37] and hope okay [04:41] once again he's [04:44] not touching he's as close as he could [04:46] be without touching [04:48] but only slightly crooked okay [04:51] now that that meant him straight okay [04:54] forward [04:56] okay get behind if you can with the [04:58] camera [05:00] okay and halt [05:04] okay again a nice quick set uh [05:08] by popping the lead she was able to get [05:09] him to scoot back a little bit [05:11] okay exercise finished the using a bench [05:15] as we mentioned before is the way we [05:17] start all of our dogs [05:18] it really gives the handler better [05:20] control you're closer to the dog [05:22] and it's easy to fix problems by putting [05:25] the dog [05:26] this near the rear of the bench [05:29] she should be able to put him in a stand [05:33] or [05:33] sit and have him tuck like that time he [05:36] tucked he didn't move his front feet [05:38] okay if he's towards the rear of the [05:41] bench he really can't [05:42] tuck tell him down okay now back to a [05:45] sip [05:47] okay again a tucking set why [05:50] butt stayed where it was front feet [05:52] didn't move [05:54] from the first sit you ever do with your [05:56] puppy during imprinting [05:58] this is the kind of set that you're [06:00] going to accept you will not [06:02] accept any rocking set ever if you do [06:05] you're going to spend the rest of the [06:06] dog's life trying to correct it probably [06:08] never correct it [06:10] so do it again [06:13] and back up to sit okay [06:17] that time he actually brought his his [06:19] butt up into him [06:20] now get him on the ground and now [06:24] walk him and then do a halt [06:30] and watch his front feet okay he tucked [06:33] that time [06:34] okay do maybe do a stand or something [06:37] no sit i see okay that time he rocked [06:40] did you see his front feet move back [06:44] okay okay do it one more time just [06:50] okay again his front feet moved so how [06:53] can she [06:53] prevent that on the ground she's got it [06:55] on the bench but not on the ground [06:57] best thing she could do is take her hand [06:59] and push forward on the dog's crew [07:01] that would be right there where the tail [07:03] comes out and kind of tuck his rear end [07:05] under him [07:06] this age dog could be difficult he's [07:09] already pretty set in his waist [07:10] but with a puppy it's real easy from the [07:13] beginning to make sure they always tuck [07:15] when you're healing with a dog and you [07:16] come to a halt the dog has to sit [07:19] without a verbal command so anytime she [07:22] stops [07:23] the dog should automatically sit okay [07:26] there may not be a verbal command [07:28] but there is a body signal and that is [07:32] the fact that she stopped [07:33] so for a while we're going to say sit [07:37] as we come to a stop sit as we're [07:39] stopping [07:40] so sit and that if that left foot [07:44] is coming forward to come to the stop [07:46] you're saying the command sit [07:47] you don't want to stop and then say sit [07:50] because the dog's going to sit [07:52] late so [07:55] as you come to a stop sit [07:58] that's when the dog should stop and sit [08:00] as that [08:01] left foot is coming to stop i always [08:04] stop on my right and bring my left up [08:07] that gives the dog the most amount of [08:08] time to sit correctly [08:10] now she's got [08:14] dog sitting and what i would as a [08:17] trusting judge or [08:18] ipo i would consider that sitting in a [08:21] proper position [08:22] akc would prefer that you move your feet [08:25] up just a little bit [08:27] that that would be he did too the the [08:30] set would be pretty much in the small of [08:32] your in the arch [08:33] portion of your shoe okay so [08:37] this dog is so sharp that you can issue [08:39] the command [08:40] at the appropriate time to get him to [08:41] sit where you want him to sit so let's [08:43] try that a couple of times [08:49] okay okay [08:53] that was as far as the akc would be [08:55] concerned i think that would be a [08:57] perfectly good set um i like to see him [09:00] a little [09:01] further forward but that looks good uh [09:04] so as she stops now she's going to do it [09:06] without a command [09:08] and the dog has already done it so many [09:09] times with the command [09:11] he really doesn't need it he knows that [09:13] when she stops he's supposed to sit [09:14] okay do it about turn and come back [09:20] okay [09:23] okay do it one more time he sat [09:26] he's a little slower to sit [09:30] okay but he sat straight [09:36] good that looks good exercise finished [09:39] so [09:40] he's sitting and the cue to set is her [09:43] stopping [09:44] so we call that an automatic sit and [09:47] and it all shows you would not be [09:49] allowed to say sit [09:51] when you stop the dog should [09:52] automatically sit when you come to a [09:54] stop [09:55] even with a service dog that's what you [09:57] would want [09:58] thanks again for watching make sure

The school he founded is the culmination of that passion, and their students and graduates share his dedication. Over the past four decades, TRS graduated a major percentage of the foremost trainers in the world. Employers snap up at their alumni.  Those who start their own businesses succeed consistently. One very successful graduate put it this way,  “There is no other school with the experience and instructional track record of TRS. There is no other school that teaches many different training techniques, then encourages the student to choose the methods most comfortable for them."" Tom authored three major dog-training books. He won training competitions time after time with dogs he raised and trained. He pioneered and developed the celebrated Puppy Imprinting Program. He coined the phrase ""imprinting"" as it applies to dogs.  He is the first to import the Belgian Malinois breed to the United States. Graduation from TRS depends upon successfully accomplishing industry-recognized objectives and requirements. The Tom Rose School curriculum is proven effective in meeting and exceeding those requirements. Lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on experience guide you to accomplish objectives that would take a talented trainer ten years to learn on their own."

They operate successful companies around the world, are top-level employees, they operate/teach at other schools and win championship competitions worldwide.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 236/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back everyone to another episode [00:02] today we are going to be going over the [00:03] figure8 healing routine this is [00:05] something you're going to see in a lot [00:07] of competition obedience to include AKC [00:09] as well as igp also known as shiten Tom [00:12] from the tomrose school is going to be [00:14] showing us the step-by-step process that [00:16] he likes to take when he's teaching a [00:18] dog this exercise now if you want more [00:21] direct one-on-one help or support I do [00:24] offer in-person private training lessons [00:26] as well as Zoom training lessons you can [00:28] find the information for that in the [00:30] description below I hope you guys [00:32] enjoyed today's episode let's go ahead [00:34] and get started okay we're going to get [00:36] started on the figure8 this kind of a [00:39] long approach but it's the best approach [00:41] obviously you don't want to give away [00:43] points on figure eight uh I've had a lot [00:45] of AKC judges tell me they could skip [00:49] all the rest of the healing just have a [00:50] figure eight and they could assess or [00:53] take away points based on the dog's [00:55] ability and doing the figure eight it's [00:57] the most difficult healing exercise that [00:59] a dog Handler have to do together what I [01:02] would do first is I would teach the dog [01:07] to go through a double about turn so it [01:11] would be a [01:12] 360 but we don't want to make it like [01:15] this and round it out we want to make it [01:18] a literally a pivot so what I've done [01:21] here she's already done pivots sadic to [01:24] standing still with the dog uh she's [01:26] done swing finishes so the dog's already [01:29] clued in on how to to do this to some [01:30] extent so I put two circles in the [01:33] ground about uh 15 ft apart I'm going to [01:36] tell her to get her dog and walk into [01:39] this circle from that end up there do a [01:41] pivot with her feet saying within the [01:43] circle which guarantees that she's doing [01:45] a pivot and not a circle and then walk [01:48] to this next one and do the same thing [01:52] again but to the left and after she [01:55] concludes this she continues going the [01:57] same sh way she was originally [02:00] okay so let's go ahead and give that a [02:02] try again this is a trained dog you've [02:04] seen him already he's a nice healer he [02:07] has some issues with crowding and [02:10] lagging and crooked sets that we're [02:12] we're working on [02:22] okay okay keep going we prefer he didn't [02:25] sit and Scoot it around but that goes [02:27] back to his PR training [02:32] okay okay you're going too far now you [02:36] should be doing both right on one and [02:38] left on the other okay but because she's [02:40] kind of stopping she needs to be a lot [02:43] more convincing just go around and keep [02:46] going cuz we we really don't want him to [02:49] sit if he does sit are we going to [02:50] correct p no we don't need to correct P [02:53] because he will eventually discover he [02:55] doesn't need to sit it's a lot better if [02:57] he doesn't just like some dogs when you [02:59] do a slow will'll try to sit at the [03:01] beginning of the slow cuz they think [03:02] you're stopping once they discover [03:04] you're not going to stop they'll quit [03:06] doing it there's nothing that needs to [03:08] be corrected so let's do a right here [03:10] and a left up there and keep keep it [03:13] flowing go around quick quick quick [03:15] there you go there you go and he came [03:16] out of it lagging a little [03:20] bit now keep going go go go go go keep [03:24] going okay now turn do an about turn and [03:26] come [03:28] back okay right [03:31] pivot they doing the right that was much [03:33] better than last [03:35] time and flow through quick on the [03:39] left go sitting a little bit too okay [03:42] exercise [03:43] finished now in this session we're not [03:46] going to be able to correct the sitting [03:49] but my opinion is within a week of doing [03:51] that or we'll say 20 or 30 sessions the [03:54] dogs are going to quit and he's going to [03:57] start walking with you cuz he's thinking [04:00] you're stopping so he just has to learn [04:02] that you're not stopping uh if you want [04:04] to help him with a command like heal [04:06] heal heal or something like that when [04:07] you're going around just little talking [04:09] to him to help him understand that [04:11] you're not [04:12] stopping uh again he's not doing [04:14] anything wrong but we just want to break [04:16] him from doing that okay next now we're [04:19] going to we'll figure that you have [04:21] corrected this which you haven't but [04:22] just for purpose of the the video we're [04:24] going to go ahead and set up a figure [04:26] eight using [04:28] cones we're gon to place the [04:32] cones eight feet [04:39] apart now what the Hanah is going to do [04:41] she's going to start within 2 feet of [04:43] the center line and so what she's going [04:45] to do is she's going to begin to the [04:49] left because it's always best to begin [04:51] with the left also best to begin with [04:53] your right foot so as we talked about [04:55] with footwork we're boxing the dog in so [04:57] he doesn't take off the wrong way so as [05:00] we step off with the right foot we go [05:02] forward and now we're going around to [05:04] the left but as we hit about here we'll [05:07] do a real quick Circle and then go back [05:12] here now if the dog's lagging about [05:15] again a real fast Circle and then we'll [05:17] continue with the figure eight so if the [05:20] dog's crowding you're going to do a [05:22] circle if the dog's lagging you're going [05:24] to do a circle okay come on up give it a [05:26] try okay she's going to begin about 2 ft [05:29] okay uh within the center line so come [05:33] forward up there going start with the [05:35] right foot and go around the left Cone [05:39] first if the dog bumps or touches her [05:43] she's going to do a very quick [05:45] right-handed a left-handed pivot and as [05:48] she go to stop the crowding and as she [05:51] comes to the right turn if the dog lags [05:53] at all she's going to do it very fast [05:55] right-handed pivot okay forward [06:10] okay good okay and right hand do another [06:14] right hand [06:17] pivot okay now go around [06:23] normally so the dog was a little further [06:25] away not touching and the dog's in [06:27] perfect heel position all the way around [06:30] exercise finished good so the purpose [06:33] for doing that is we don't want the dog [06:35] to crowd or bump on the left-handed [06:38] Circle we don't want to lag on the [06:39] right-handed Circle so by using the [06:42] pivots we can keep the dog up with her [06:44] in proper position all the way around [06:46] there's also a lot of other ways to [06:48] train this none of it ever work for me [06:51] as well as this method thanks for

The school he founded is the culmination of that passion, and their students and graduates share his dedication. Over the past four decades, TRS graduated a major percentage of the foremost trainers in the world. Employers snap up at their alumni.  Those who start their own businesses succeed consistently. One very successful graduate put it this way,  “There is no other school with the experience and instructional track record of TRS. There is no other school that teaches many different training techniques, then encourages the student to choose the methods most comfortable for them."" Tom authored three major dog-training books. He won training competitions time after time with dogs he raised and trained. He pioneered and developed the celebrated Puppy Imprinting Program. He coined the phrase ""imprinting"" as it applies to dogs.  He is the first to import the Belgian Malinois breed to the United States. Graduation from TRS depends upon successfully accomplishing industry-recognized objectives and requirements. The Tom Rose School curriculum is proven effective in meeting and exceeding those requirements. Lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on experience guide you to accomplish objectives that would take a talented trainer ten years to learn on their own. We have hundreds of graduates to prove how effective our programs are."

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 240/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back and thanks again for [00:01] joining us nate schumer here at the tom [00:03] rose school for professional dog [00:05] trainers [00:05] and in this video tom rose is going to [00:07] be showing you guys exactly how he likes [00:09] to teach his students [00:11] the broad jump this is an exercise that [00:13] is required part of the akc obedience [00:15] routine and it is considered a very [00:17] difficult exercise but if you do it the [00:19] right way [00:19] and you take the appropriate steps you [00:21] will find success with your dogs [00:23] let's get started talk now about doing [00:25] the broad jump [00:27] and we would begin with one board [00:30] two boards three boards with running [00:32] with the dog [00:33] in this case the dog has already been [00:36] through jumping [00:37] all the way up to four boards so now [00:40] we're going to show where we progress [00:42] at this point so she's going to do what [00:44] we call a breakaway [00:45] she's going to run with the dog and this [00:48] is too many [00:49] boards for her to jump with the dog if [00:52] she only had one or two she could jump [00:53] with the dog [00:54] and this she can't so what she's going [00:57] to do [00:58] is run with the dog [01:02] go close to the jump and as soon as the [01:05] dog runs on the other lands on the other [01:06] side [01:07] she's going to turn left not right and [01:10] go around [01:10] we'll explain why later so let's go [01:12] ahead and do that right now [01:14] uh-oh jump that's good really nice job [01:18] but now she turned to the right [01:21] and as a result the dog clipped the jump [01:24] and cut this corner that's why we're [01:27] going to go [01:28] to the left because normally the handle [01:30] would be on the left and when we show [01:31] the dog [01:32] the handle would be on the left so we [01:34] want the dog [01:35] to cut more to the right away from the [01:37] handler okay after we've done that [01:39] a few times and a dog is jumping [01:41] correctly [01:42] then we can do what's called a breakaway [01:44] in which case [01:45] the dog's gonna sit stay here handler's [01:48] gonna be here [01:50] and she's gonna tell the dog to jump and [01:52] as [01:53] the dog is jumping or leaving the jump [01:56] she's going to be cutting again to the [01:57] left and going this way [01:59] okay [02:04] go all the way to the end of the leash [02:08] okay now you're going to say jump and [02:10] you run towards me [02:11] jump okay good [02:16] and again we have a bit of a problem i [02:18] know what happened in the background but [02:19] the dog is cutting much too much to the [02:21] right [02:23] okay once we've done this several times [02:26] we're ready to [02:27] make a little test to see what the dog [02:28] is doing so this time she can unclip the [02:31] buckle do exactly the same thing [02:36] and she's still going to run with the [02:37] dog okay jump [02:45] and the dog performed that correctly now [02:48] she's going to repeat the exercise [02:50] but this time she's going to make an [02:53] attempt [02:54] to stand still which is a big step [02:57] it's really hard for the dog so if she's [02:59] standing here the dog may decide [03:01] they really don't want to jump and or [03:03] they may jump and hit they jump and come [03:05] to you [03:06] so as you're watching the jump if the [03:08] jump looks good [03:10] then you could kind of step out and [03:12] bring the dog to you [03:13] if the dog seems to be jumping wrong [03:16] coming crossways [03:17] then again you want to cut across and go [03:19] that way [03:21] sit sit [03:26] jump high [03:30] so even though we have a problem with [03:32] the dog cutting it [03:33] just for purposes of instruction this [03:36] time [03:37] remain standing and then call the dog to [03:39] you [03:40] so sit back as the dog jumps [03:44] instead of moving you're just going to [03:46] turn and call the doctor what's that [03:48] front in front of you [03:50] sit this may create a problem because [03:52] the dog's really not ready for it [03:54] because he's cutting so bad [03:56] jump front [04:01] good good okay basically that's all the [04:05] steps [04:06] but that also supports the argument [04:09] as to why you want to always cut left [04:12] because i don't know if in your prior [04:14] training or whatever [04:15] you've been letting the dog come to the [04:17] right [04:18] and so now when she formalized it the [04:21] dog [04:21] cut over and really didn't do a [04:24] qualifying jump [04:26] so what she needs to do is go back and [04:28] do a lot of [04:29] breakaways where she started here tell [04:31] him jump and then running [04:33] towards that extra sign over there to [04:35] the left [04:36] and you could throw a ball if you wanted [04:38] sit [04:39] now you're only going to throw the ball [04:41] while the dog is airborne not before [04:45] i got a feeling she's going to come to [04:47] you so while the dog is in the air you [04:49] throw the ball [04:50] jump there you go [04:54] the reason we do that is if you threw [04:57] the ball before [04:58] the dog might cut it if you throw off or [05:00] after the dog's not going to turn around [05:03] but if you throw it in the air the dog [05:04] is powerless to change structure [05:08] now we were talking about some other [05:10] methods to do this one would be [05:12] a stick jumping [05:17] jump jump [05:20] good said no try a higher jump put [05:24] on a stake don't make her go back and [05:25] forth though because we don't want to [05:27] get them in the habit of going both ways [05:30] heel sit [05:35] okay hold it up a little higher go ahead [05:37] stand up straight [05:39] there okay jump [05:43] we'll sit okay [05:47] now you can do the same thing since [05:48] she's doing it over [05:50] the broad jump now with the stick as we [05:53] mentioned with the jumping chute [05:55] we can direct where the dog jumps so [05:57] since we want the dog to jump [05:59] away from us we could hold the stick at [06:01] this type of an angle [06:03] if we wanted the dog to jump closer to [06:05] us with hole in this angle [06:06] but to force them over to the side we [06:08] can hold it like this [06:10] jump good jump [06:18] this dog is even choosing to jump the [06:20] higher part of the stick [06:21] but once we do this a few times we will [06:24] have redirected the dog to the outer [06:26] part of the jump the biggest problem [06:27] with some dogs jumping the [06:29] bra jump is they're going fast we want [06:31] as much height as possible the higher [06:33] the dog [06:34] travels when he jumps more likely he is [06:36] to clear it uh [06:38] you think a human when they're doing a [06:39] broad jump they don't need height they [06:41] need distance and in this case if the [06:44] dog's going fast he's going to get [06:45] distance and not hike [06:46] and we'll ever have problems so we want [06:48] to get a good loft over the jump if we [06:51] can get it [06:52] okay sit and remember you can throw the [06:54] ball while he's in the air and always [06:55] throw towards the door [06:58] jump okay a little late on the throw [07:05] it won't take long before she'll realize [07:07] the ball always goes that direction [07:14] good [07:16] so the purpose for the bar jump is to [07:19] get loft [07:20] to get height over the jump and this [07:21] dog's doing a very nice job [07:23] the stick jump would be my preference [07:25] another thing i can do with the stick [07:27] jump [07:28] is this is a little bit longer than a [07:30] stick i would like to use [07:32] but i could hold the stick like this and [07:35] as the dog is approaching [07:37] the jump all i got to do is that and i [07:40] can [07:41] do it at the last minute the dog would [07:42] crash into it if he didn't get enough [07:44] loft [07:45] if i do that then he knows that's going [07:47] to happen he'll jump high [07:48] reviewing again we begin [07:52] with a broad jump with one board jumping [07:54] with a hammer two [07:55] boards jumping with the handler maybe [07:57] three boards jumping within [07:59] them maybe at that point it's time to do [08:02] where we put the dog on a sit stay [08:04] go to the side have the dog jump and [08:07] then we cut to the left [08:09] then pretty soon we're going to have the [08:10] handler stay still [08:12] but the dog will say have him jump chase [08:15] the ball to the left [08:17] finally and not too many times even once [08:19] we're finished [08:20] we'll have the handler stay still have [08:22] the dog jump and simply turn and call [08:24] that [08:24] up to us we wouldn't want to do that too [08:26] many times [08:28] because if we do the dog's life will [08:30] expect that if he does expect it [08:32] then he's going to have a tendency to [08:33] cut the jump the very thing we're trying [08:35] to avoid [08:36] that is what you're going to do when you [08:38] show the dog and [08:40] akc open agility would be a different [08:43] thing it wouldn't matter [08:44] but for akc open we want the dog to jump [08:47] over the center [08:48] turn and come back have plenty of hype [08:50] and [08:51] totally clear the jump with a lot of [08:53] hype thank you again for watching i hope [08:55] everyone enjoyed [08:56] today's episode as always let me know [08:58]

This is a word or sound that lets the dog know that they are correct and will be delivered a reward. It’s called a continuation marker because unlike the terminal marker, it doesn’t release the dog. Meaning, if your dog is in a command stay, you can use this marker without releasing the dog from the stay. However, if your dog is not in a command stay, then this marker just means they’ll be rewarded. Therefore, this often confuses people because of the terminology “continuation”. This is why it’s easier to understand by what it predicts: A continuation marker predicts a reward. That’s it. It doesn’t change the circumstances, so if the dog is in a stay, they remain in the stay, and if the dog is not in a stay, then they remain free from the stay. In contrast, we have the terminal markers (I like to use the word “free”). These release dogs from commanded positions as well as guaranteeing a reward. Ex.: If a dog was in a sitting position and you use your terminal marker, they are released from that position and will be given a reward (indicating the sit behavior is finished)."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 243/841,"We also have a non-reinforcement marker, and this is for mistakes. For example, if you tell your dog to sit, and the dog downs instead, you would use your non-reinforcement marker and then you would re-command the sit. Once the dog sits, you would then reward the dog. Giving a dog the ability to make mistakes and try again is imperative. If the dog gets corrected for making a mistake too early in training, then the dog will become cautious and is less likely to try new things, which would make it more difficult to teach new behaviors. I also like to teach a marker that signals negative reinforcement. This is very useful when teaching the stay command or if you wanted to teach your dog to not jump on the furniture. This helps your dog to learn what they can and can’t do without receiving a form of positive punishment. The type of negative reinforcement that it predicts is leash pressure. (As mentioned earlier, for the purposes of this book, we will use the word “Wrong”) The last marker is a signal for positive punishment. This sound lets the dog know they will be corrected. We use this for behaviors we would like to remove from the dog’s repertoire. After we say the conditioned correction (“No”), the correction is performed through a training collar. In regard to the science part, keep in mind that when you are training your dog the science is always the same; what varies between each dog are things like motivation, perseverance, intelligence, temperament, disposition, etc. Being able to adjust for each dog’s specific needs is considered the art of dog training. ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ I hope you guys enjoy this video and if you can, hit that subscribe button.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 244/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back everyone to another episode [00:01] today we are talking about markers this [00:03] is probably one of the most important [00:05] things [00:05] when it comes to training and working [00:07] with our dogs now a marker is a [00:09] condition reinforcer it has been [00:11] conditioned to be reinforcing [00:13] now we call it a marker because it [00:14] signifies that we are marking a moment [00:16] in time [00:17] when our dogs are right or wrong and we [00:19] use markers because it's been [00:21] scientifically proven [00:22] that we have approximately one second [00:24] give or take depending on the dog [00:26] to let them know when they're doing a [00:27] behavior we're trying to capture [00:29] whether or not it's something we would [00:30] like them to repeat or it's something we [00:32] would not like them to repeat [00:34] and in order for a marker to be a marker [00:36] it must predict [00:38] one of the four quadrants of opera [00:39] conditioning now what are the four [00:41] quadrants of opera conditioning well [00:43] it's positive reinforcement [00:44] negative reinforcement positive [00:46] punishment and negative punishment [00:48] now this is what helps us create what's [00:50] known as an opera dog [00:52] and that is a dog that understands that [00:53] their behavior has an effect on their [00:55] environment so the dog starts to [00:56] understand that they can make good [00:58] things happen [00:59] as well as bad things happen and when we [01:01] train a dog this way [01:02] we create an incredibly confident [01:04] motivated dog [01:05] that knows how to navigate within our [01:07] world in ways that other dogs [01:09] don't so first we have to condition our [01:11] dog to the markers but before we do that [01:13] i want to explain what each one of the [01:15] four quadrants are [01:17] very quickly this often confuses people [01:19] because they think positive means good [01:21] and negative means bad [01:22] well that's not what we're talking about [01:24] when we are using positive or negative [01:25] reinforcement positive or negative [01:27] punishment [01:28] but instead positive means adding to the [01:30] equation whereas negative means taking [01:32] away [01:33] reinforcement means encouraging a [01:35] behavior to be repeated [01:36] and punishment means preventing a [01:38] behavior from being repeated [01:39] so positive reinforcement anything we [01:41] add to the equation to reinforce a [01:43] behavior [01:44] to get the repeat of a behavior if we [01:46] tell our dog good boy or good girl we [01:48] give them a treat a toy [01:49] we pet them anything we add that they [01:52] see as valuable [01:53] in order to get them to repeat a [01:54] behavior so then what's negative [01:56] reinforcement negative reinforcement is [01:58] not what you think it's not a punishment [02:00] it's not a correction remember [02:02] reinforcement means [02:03] encouraging a behavior to be repeated so [02:06] negative reinforcement we take something [02:07] away to reinforce a behavior [02:09] this means when we turn on pressure this [02:11] is used when we [02:13] use leash pressure training with our [02:15] dogs but we turn pressure on and when [02:17] the dog complies we turn the pressure [02:19] off [02:19] that's the negative if you've ever taken [02:21] your hand and pushed it on your dog's [02:22] rear end to get your dog to sit [02:24] and your dog sits and you remove your [02:26] hand you just implemented [02:28] negative reinforcement if you've taken [02:30] your hands and pushed down on your dog's [02:31] shoulder blades to give them a little [02:33] bit of guidance to go into the down [02:34] and your dog goes into a down and you [02:36] remove your hand you just use [02:38] negative reinforcement if you've done [02:40] leash pressure training [02:41] negative reinforcement if you taught [02:43] your dog the healing stick [02:44] negative reinforcement again we turn on [02:47] pressure when they comply [02:48] whatever that pressure is is removed now [02:51] we have positive punishment another one [02:52] that confuses people because they think [02:54] how can a punishment be positive [02:56] again adding to the equation so anytime [02:58] we add to the equation to eliminate a [03:00] behavior [03:00] we're implementing positive punishment [03:03] if you yell at your [03:04] dog not recommended but that's a version [03:06] a leash pop on a training collar a [03:08] remote training collar [03:09] uh if you escorted your dog with a water [03:12] bottle and your dog doesn't like being [03:13] squirted with a water bottle [03:14] anything we add these are all examples [03:17] of positive [03:18] punishment now if i'm going to use [03:19] positive punishment on my dogs while [03:21] training [03:22] i use a leash and a training collar i [03:24] always use training collars and never my [03:26] hands [03:26] the reason for this is anytime our hands [03:29] start to go towards our dogs [03:30] it should mean something good we're [03:32] adding some sort of value [03:34] not causing any sort of pain or [03:36] discomfort so hands [03:38] as corrections not a good idea no knife [03:41] handing or heel kicking dogs [03:43] we use a leash and a training collar [03:45] because again any time your hand goes [03:46] towards your dog your dog should be [03:48] happy because [03:49] it means they're either going to receive [03:50] a treat they're going to be pet or a toy [03:53] something of value so positive [03:55] punishment adding something to eliminate [03:57] a behavior [03:57] negative punishment all you probably use [04:00] this on your dogs [04:01] this is when we take something of value [04:02] away if you're petting your dog and your [04:04] dog jumps up and you stop petting [04:06] you just implemented negative punishment [04:08] if you ask your dog to sit and your dog [04:10] downs instead and you don't give your [04:11] dog the treat [04:12] you just implemented negative punishment [04:15] so now with all that being said [04:16] i like to have a word or sound that [04:18] predicts each one of those [04:20] so then we can use those to clearly and [04:22] effectively communicate with our dogs [04:23] now we have two that predict positive [04:25] reinforcement and this often confuses [04:27] people as [04:28] well so we have one it's known as a [04:30] continuation marker and one that's known [04:32] as a terminal marker [04:33] now the continuation marker easiest way [04:35] to remember this is [04:36] our words or our sounds mean to our dogs [04:39] what they predict [04:40] so a continuation marker i use the word [04:42] yes if you've watched my videos [04:44] when i tell a dog yes that just means [04:46] they're going to get a reward it just [04:48] means [04:48] here comes the reward you did the [04:50] behavior correctly but it doesn't change [04:52] the dog's circumstances [04:54] so if i have a dog in a stay they must [04:56] maintain the stay [04:57] if i have a dog free from a stay they [04:59] remain free from the stay [05:01] my continuation marker or my word yes [05:03] just [05:04] means a reward then we have the terminal [05:06] marker the terminal marker guarantees [05:08] release [05:09] and reward so if i'm working with my dog [05:11] and i have my dog in a state position [05:13] and i use the terminal marker my dog is [05:15] released from that stay and they can [05:17] come and get access to the reward [05:19] so the only time it really matters which [05:21] marker we're using if we want to [05:22] reinforce a behavior by giving [05:24] the dog a reward for something they did [05:26] it doesn't matter unless we are working [05:28] a stay [05:28] so if you're not working any sort of [05:30] stay you can use either marker and it's [05:32] completely fine [05:33] it only matters when we start to work to [05:35] stay and we want either the dog to [05:36] maintain the position so we can give [05:38] them a reward [05:39] or we would like to release them and [05:40] give them a reward now we also have a [05:42] marker [05:43] that predicts negative reinforcement [05:45] this is going to be our leash pressure [05:47] i use the word wrong i do this because [05:50] it gives me an opportunity to [05:52] show my dog what i want them to do in [05:54] any given situation [05:55] without having to implement any sort of [05:57] positive punishment i use this when i'm [05:59] teaching the stay [05:59] i use it to reinforce behaviors i use [06:02] this when i'm teaching boundaries or [06:03] certain things i don't want the dog to [06:05] do for example the dog breaks the stay [06:07] i say one wrong that pinpoints the [06:09] moment in time the dog made the mistake [06:11] i go back i use the leash and i place [06:13] the dog back into the stay position [06:15] and i do that with all my stays or if i [06:17] have a dog that's entering maybe the [06:19] room that we don't want them to be in if [06:20] you have a new infant or [06:21] your office or the kitchen the dog walks [06:24] into the kitchen we say wrong [06:25] pinpointing the moment in time the dog [06:26] was incorrect [06:27] and we guide the dog out of the kitchen [06:29] using leash pressure negative [06:30] reinforcement not a punishment [06:32] this shows our dog if you hear us say [06:35] the word wrong or whatever word we [06:36] choose [06:37] then you need to stop what you're doing [06:39] or go back into the previous position [06:41] and then we continue to do this up until [06:43] our dog knows what's expected of them [06:45] and they know how to turn off pressure [06:46] by complying and we become the pressure [06:48] when we're reinforcing specific [06:49] behaviors once we get to that point [06:52] then we can use positive punishment the [06:54] word that i like to use for that [06:56] is the word no so i say no before i give [06:59] my dog a correction so if i'm using [07:01] a leash on a martingale and i'm doing a [07:03] leash pop my dog does something i don't [07:05] like [07:06] let's say my dog is chewing on the [07:07] furniture no correction [07:10] my dog stops chewing on the furniture [07:11] good boy or good girl whatever the case [07:14] is [07:14] so no means you're going to receive a [07:16] correction so we can pinpoint a moment [07:18] in time if our dog's doing something [07:19] that is [07:20] not allowed and we can follow it up with [07:22] the correction and then we have a marker [07:24] that predicts [07:25] negative punishment this is known as a [07:27] non-reinforcement marker [07:28] this just means our dog made a mistake [07:30] they're not going to receive the reward [07:32] but they could try again [07:33] for example you tell your dog to sit [07:35] your dog lays down instead [07:36] you go uh-uh pinpointing the moment in [07:38] time your dog made the mistake [07:40] you repeat the command sit your dog sits [07:42] yes reward and your dog goes that's what [07:44] gets me to the reward and we do this [07:46] when our dogs are making mistakes now [07:49] when we're conditioning our dog to the [07:51] markers [07:51] it's very important that the marker [07:54] precedes [07:55] whatever the quadrant that we're using [07:57] it's supposed to predict so [07:59] if i say yes then that's supposed to [08:01] predict a treat if i say free that [08:03] predicts a treat and release that's my [08:04] terminal marker if i say wrong that [08:06] predicts leash pressure no that predicts [08:08] a correction [08:09] when we are first getting our dog's [08:10] condition to the sounds and this comes [08:12] from the studies conducted by ivan [08:13] pavlov [08:14] he had a tone that would go off prior to [08:16] the food being delivered to the dogs [08:17] after a certain amount of repetitions [08:19] when the dogs heard the tone they would [08:20] begin to salivate before the food is [08:22] present [08:22] that's what he called classical [08:23] conditioning but if you think about it [08:25] he just renamed a word and that word is [08:27] predictability [08:28] because if the sound went off while the [08:30] food was being delivered or if the sound [08:32] went off [08:32] while the dogs were eating they never [08:34] became classically conditioned to the [08:35] sound [08:36] the sound has to precede the delivery of [08:38] the reward or [08:39] whatever one we're using out of those [08:41] four quadrants by about a half second or [08:43] so [08:43] now this is another thing that gets [08:45] people uh struggling with teaching their [08:47] dog the markers and the reason why is [08:49] they say the marker and they want to get [08:50] the reward to the dog within a second [08:52] when we are conditioning our dogs to the [08:54] markers all we have to do is start [08:56] to move as long as the dog's watching us [08:58] start to move [08:59] within a second of saying the marker so [09:01] let's say you're the dog and i'm trying [09:03] to get you conditioned to the word yes [09:04] i say yes once i finish saying yes on [09:07] the timeline [09:08] that's when the second starts and i have [09:10] that entire second [09:11] before i have to start moving not before [09:14] i have to get you the reward [09:15] so i can go yes and then start to move [09:18] i like to give myself a pause about a [09:21] half second [09:22] pause now remember a second is way [09:24] longer than what most of us think [09:25] one mississippi two mississippi three [09:27] mississippi four mississippi [09:29] one second is a good amount of time so [09:31] we say the marker and then we have to [09:32] start moving within a second [09:34] we don't have to get the reward to the [09:36] dog within a second we just have to [09:37] start moving [09:38] so if i say yes boom i made it i made it [09:41] within the one second the dog knows the [09:43] treats coming [09:44] boom we made the connection same thing [09:46] with the terminal marker we save free [09:47] or whatever word you're choosing half [09:49] second pause then we move back [09:51] encouraging the dog to come get the [09:52] reward [09:53] same thing with our wrong wrong then [09:55] leash pressure no [09:57] then the correction and we continue to [09:59] do this up until our dog's conditioned [10:01] once they're conditioned now we can use [10:03] it at any point in time [10:05] and the most effective way to use it is [10:06] to say the marker [10:08] whether it's one that predicts something [10:10] that we would like the dog to repeat a [10:11] behavior such as [10:12] yes or free or if we're using a marker [10:14] such as no [10:15] to stop a behavior we don't want all we [10:18] have to be able to do [10:19] is say the marker within a second of the [10:22] dog doing the behavior [10:23] we're trying to capture so your dog [10:25] let's say [10:27] bites the carpet decides that it's a [10:29] good idea to bite the carpet you look [10:30] over [10:31] you see your dog bite the carpet your [10:33] dog stops biting the carpet you still [10:35] have [10:35] one second up until you lost that window [10:38] if your dog stops biting the carpet [10:40] and more than a second goes by you've [10:42] missed your opportunity [10:43] because now your dog's on to something [10:45] new but you do have a whole second [10:47] so you see your dog bite the carpet you [10:48] go no the dog goes oops [10:50] i messed up i'm not supposed to do that [10:52] and then we walk over and we can follow [10:54] up with the correction [10:55] same thing with our rewards if i have a [10:57] dog 30 feet away from me and i tell that [10:59] dog to sit and the moment that dog's [11:01] butt hits the ground [11:02] i say yes pinpointing the moment in time [11:04] when the dog was correct [11:05] now i start to walk to the dog and the [11:07] dog's going oh i did it right [11:09] here comes that treat oh i'm getting [11:11] paid and we give him the reward we made [11:13] the connection [11:14] so keep this in mind once your dog is [11:16] conditioned to the markers [11:17] you have as long as your dog is paying [11:20] attention [11:21] in order to get them the primary [11:23] reinforcer [11:24] so this is a good amount of time when we [11:26] get our dogs conditioned to the marker [11:28] it doesn't mean it just gives us one [11:29] extra second [11:30] that wouldn't be very valuable it gives [11:32] us as long as a dog is paying attention [11:34] so it could be 30 seconds it could be [11:36] two minutes three minutes [11:38] as long as the dog is maintaining focus [11:40] and they know the reward is coming to [11:41] the corrections coming [11:42] you're going to be able to make the [11:43] connection and this is going to make [11:45] your training [11:46] significantly easier and there's all [11:48] kinds of different scenarios where [11:49] markers are so [11:50] valuable if you're teaching your dog a [11:52] new behavior if you're trying to teach [11:54] your dog boundaries [11:55] if you're trying to show your dog how to [11:56] behave properly out in public [11:58] these are going to be the tools the [12:00] foundation that's going to help you [12:02] achieve your dog training goals and give [12:05] your dog a new level of freedom [12:07] because your dog is so obedient and does [12:09] what you need them to do and you're able [12:10] to communicate very clearly with them [12:13] i hope you guys enjoyed this

The school he founded is the culmination of that passion, and their students and graduates share his dedication. Over the past four decades, TRS graduated a major percentage of the foremost trainers in the world. Employers snap up at their alumni.  Those who start their own businesses succeed consistently. One very successful graduate put it this way,  “There is no other school with the experience and instructional track record of TRS. There is no other school that teaches many different training techniques, then encourages the student to choose the methods most comfortable for them."" Tom authored three major dog-training books. He won training competitions time after time with dogs he raised and trained. He pioneered and developed the celebrated Puppy Imprinting Program. He coined the phrase ""imprinting"" as it applies to dogs.  He is the first to import the Belgian Malinois breed to the United States. Graduation from TRS depends upon successfully accomplishing industry-recognized objectives and requirements. The Tom Rose School curriculum is proven effective in meeting and exceeding those requirements. Lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on experience guide you to accomplish objectives that would take a talented trainer ten years to learn on their own. We have hundreds of graduates to prove how effective our programs are."

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 248/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back everyone and thanks again [00:01] for joining us we are here at the tom [00:03] rose school for professional dog [00:04] trainers and today we are going to be [00:05] teaching our dogs a send out [00:07] this is a fun exercise that you can [00:09] teach your dogs at home even if you [00:10] don't plan on competing [00:12] let's go ahead and get started now we're [00:13] going to do a send out outside [00:15] for the first time with one of the [00:17] imprinted puppies [00:19] what we're going to do is we've got a [00:20] target set up over here [00:22] at the telephone pole which is an upside [00:24] down frisbee [00:26] so he's going to walk out with the dog [00:28] and put a piece of food on it [00:30] now remember we did this previously in [00:32] the training building [00:33] so this is the first time the dog has [00:35] done it outside [00:37] okay walk over and put your food on it [00:42] and now you're going to walk away as [00:45] far as you think you can go safely [00:50] okay get him in the heel position [00:53] okay point out the target [00:57] and you really would be better standing [00:58] on your feet for this get used to [01:00] doing that get him okay [01:05] very good okay take him up plant your [01:08] food again [01:14] uh does the handler need to run with the [01:16] dog or not [01:18] and that's kind of up to the handler if [01:20] you again are convinced your own brand [01:23] that the dog is going to go if you don't [01:25] go then you don't need to [01:27] but if the dog goes part way you're [01:29] going to have to run after him [01:31] and take him to the target [01:39] once you see him focus and point his [01:42] head where he's supposed to go [01:44] proper time to send him if he's not [01:47] going to come i would quit calling [01:49] because you don't want to [01:50] train a dog that he doesn't have to come [01:53] every time you call [01:54] because you're not actually calling [01:55] you're just trying to encourage him [01:58] you might mention if we were using a [02:00] word like come or hear [02:02] we would have to reinforce it because [02:03] the dog is required to come to us [02:06] in this case he's just trying to [02:07] verbally encourage the dog to come [02:10] so we're not really hurting the command [02:13] or [02:14] creating an issue okay i'm gonna do it [02:17] again [02:17] yeah let's go a little bit further this [02:19] time wait a minute put him down [02:21] let's talk about that for a minute i i [02:23] didn't hear [02:24] uh but he said that you [02:28] actually did call the dog and the dog [02:30] refused to come to you [02:31] so now ben is asking to get a flexi a [02:34] long line or something [02:36] he can jerk the puppy to make him come [02:38] to it [02:39] you don't want to do that here this [02:41] should be a motivational exercise [02:43] if you want to teach the dog to come [02:45] when he's called i would take him for a [02:47] walk over here near the trees uh where [02:50] he's got lots of [02:51] stuff to sniff maybe one of these is [02:53] recall but [02:54] that specific area he likes to smell [02:56] that post okay well then [02:59] so what it's going to do is it could [03:01] create avoidance of the post [03:03] because he may not know why he's getting [03:05] jerked even oh not not necessarily a [03:07] jerk just i'm gonna let it keep [03:09] tension just like not not pull him [03:12] but just say caesar and back away slowly [03:14] so it's not like a pop it's just like a [03:16] free whenever the dog doesn't want to [03:17] get off but that's [03:19] probably not going to teach him anything [03:21] you [03:22] he needs to receive some sort of a [03:23] correction [03:25] he needs to know that when you call you [03:26] have to make him come [03:28] if he had been doing that up to now he [03:30] wouldn't be doing that and you [03:32] really don't want to i i think you can [03:33] probably lose him on the weeds over here [03:35] real easy if you [03:37] walk him over there or go to a different [03:39] bowl i just hate to do it here i don't [03:41] want to [03:41] have a negative experience with this [03:43] guys i'll try another send out [03:45] or yeah you could do that again graduate [03:47] to the next step where there is no food [03:50] so you can pretend to put the food if [03:54] you want to but don't put it there [03:57] okay go back now you don't want to go so [04:00] far this time [04:01] uh now you're going to send him [04:05] assuming he has been trained he knows [04:08] down he does [04:09] random sits and downs he does downs in [04:12] all different locations he does it [04:13] immediately without correction [04:15] now you can do it here so when you send [04:18] him when he discovers there's no food [04:20] tell him his down command [04:26] no quit good praise him [04:30] and do the mat okay you should do the [04:32] magic trick [04:33] if in this case the handler made a huge [04:36] mistake [04:36] in that he fed the dog by hand which [04:39] means probably the next [04:40] couple times if he does that instead of [04:43] the dog staying there as he approaches [04:44] the dog is want to come to his hand [04:46] because that's where the food's coming [04:47] from [04:48] oh so it's just like the article yeah [04:50] exactly let's try it again [04:51] so do you want me to lift the frisbee up [04:53] doing that or just put on the freezer i [04:55] just [04:56] flipped the frisbee and the food under [04:58] there you're going to do the magic trick [05:00] though [05:02] okay so we're going to do this over [05:04] again and [05:05] this time [05:08] the food is magically going to appear [05:10] underneath it [05:15] but good got a nice quick plot [05:20] there okay by doing it this way as [05:23] opposed to feeding it by hand [05:25] we take away the interest in the handler [05:27] and the dog should not be interested in [05:29] the handler [05:30] he should be interested in the target [05:31] thanks again for

My girl has a high prey drive, so she breaks heel whenever she sees a rabbit, bird, or squirrel. If she sees another dog or jogger, she instantly starts vocalizing and lunging. What would you do in such situations? 06:56 3) How do I cut my dog's nails without having to do sneak attacks while she is asleep? She allows me to touch her feet, just won't let the clipper get close. 12:47 4) How do you train fetch and retrieve with an adult dog who doesn't seem to understand the game? 15:56 5) How can I make my dog more focused and enthusiastic like the dogs in your videos?

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 251/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone and welcome back to another [00:02] episode today we are doing a q a video [00:05] make sure you check the description for [00:07] your question so you could jump to that [00:09] portion of the video let's go ahead and [00:11] get started how do you transfer the [00:13] focus that you have in the house to [00:15] outside one of the first things we do [00:17] with any dog that we train is known as [00:20] engagement training during engagement [00:22] training we have two main goals one [00:25] teach the dog that it's good or it's [00:27] valuable to them to look at us and [00:30] number two we're teaching them two of [00:32] the markers that we're going to be using [00:34] during our training now what is a marker [00:36] a marker is a word or sound that [00:38] predicts either a reward or correction [00:41] in order for a marker to be a marker it [00:43] must predict one of the four quadrants [00:45] of opera conditioning positive and [00:47] negative reinforcement positive and [00:49] negative punishment the first two [00:51] markers that we'd like to teach [00:53] continuation marker terminal marker [00:55] continuation marker means you're going [00:57] to receive a reward terminal marker [01:00] means you are going to receive a reward [01:01] but you are also released [01:04] so with that being said the very first [01:06] thing we do known as engagement training [01:08] we teach our dogs that if they look at [01:10] us we're going to pay them for that [01:11] behavior so the dog looks up yes we give [01:14] them a piece of food the dog looks at us [01:15] again i like to use the word free then [01:18] we move back encouraging the dog to come [01:19] and get the reward so then after enough [01:22] repetitions when our dogs hear yes they [01:23] know they're going to receive a treat or [01:25] of course whatever word you choose and [01:27] when our dog's here free they're going [01:28] to be released as well as receiving a [01:30] reward now we paid them for looking at [01:33] us so it's the act of the dog [01:35] looking at us is what triggers the [01:37] marker which predicts the reward so our [01:40] dogs end up doing that behavior more [01:42] often because it's valuable to them now [01:44] when we first start teaching our dogs [01:46] anything we start in an environment with [01:48] less distractions the least amount of [01:50] distractions possible as our dogs get [01:53] better we slowly add more distractions [01:56] now if you have your dog's focus inside [01:58] the house then you take your dog outside [02:00] and you're losing your dog's focus it's [02:02] because of the different motivating [02:04] factors that you're competing with [02:05] within the environment remember [02:07] everything our dogs do is based on [02:09] motivation either they're motivated to [02:11] access something pleasant they're [02:12] motivated to prevent something [02:13] unpleasant or the behavior itself is fun [02:16] so if you want your dog to pay attention [02:18] to you outside you have a couple options [02:20] one you can increase the value of the [02:23] reward that you're using you can make [02:25] the reward that you're using more [02:26] valuable how do we do that well we bring [02:29] the dog out we start doing our [02:31] engagement training the moment we lose [02:32] our dog's focus we take the dog we put [02:35] the dog inside and we stop training we [02:37] put the dog in the crate and we stop [02:38] training losing focus ends the game now [02:42] in between training sessions we don't [02:44] feed the dog so during this portion when [02:46] we're really building our dog's [02:48] engagement we make them work for every [02:50] bite of food so they have to understand [02:53] that if they want to eat they have to [02:55] work for it so i take the dog out they [02:57] lose focus i put them away and i say [02:59] great we'll try again at dinner time i [03:01] bring the dog out at dinner time we [03:02] start working the moment i lose my dog's [03:04] focus great i put the dog away and we're [03:06] going to try again the next day up until [03:08] the point where the dog is willing to [03:10] work for the food because now they [03:12] realize that if they want to eat they [03:14] have to do what you're asking them to do [03:16] so that's one the next option is to use [03:18] a higher value reward i don't recommend [03:21] doing this because then you're [03:22] increasing the dog's pay grade but it is [03:24] an option if you have your dog outside [03:26] and you're trying to train with let's [03:28] say the dog's kibble and the dog's not [03:30] interested in the kibble because it's [03:31] not that valuable to the dog and you [03:34] want to quickly get results and you [03:36] decide to use chicken sure you might get [03:38] your dog's attention but now you [03:40] increased your dog's pay grade and now [03:42] they're not going to want to work for [03:43] the kibble anymore so i would rather [03:45] increase the value of the kibble instead [03:48] of using a different reward but that's [03:49] an option as well when your dog is not [03:52] paying attention we can use leash [03:54] pressure to cue the dog to pay attention [03:55] to us so we turn pressure on once the [03:57] dog looks at us boom we turn the [03:59] pressure off remember leash pressure is [04:01] negative reinforcement in order for [04:03] negative reinforcement to work once the [04:06] pressure is turned on it cannot be [04:07] turned off until the dog complies and [04:09] number two the moment the dog complies [04:11] the pressure has to instantly be turned [04:12] off so we can use that to get our dogs [04:15] to pay attention to us and then last we [04:17] can use positive punishment in order to [04:19] get reliability when we're working with [04:21] our dogs the two things again that fall [04:23] under obedience is a dog not doing [04:26] something we ask them to perform or a [04:27] dog not staying in a state before i [04:30] correct the dog for any behavior i have [04:32] to make sure that the dog knows what's [04:34] expected of them so they know the [04:36] command and they know how to turn off [04:38] pressure by complying so if i give a dog [04:40] a command and they still don't know it [04:42] and i still have to assist them with the [04:44] physical cue i have to give them the [04:45] answer then we're not ready to correct [04:48] them because they still don't know it [04:49] same thing if they break a stay and they [04:52] don't know that it's a stay yet we can't [04:53] correct them for it because it's very [04:55] unfair [04:56] but if your dog knows that there's a [04:57] command where they have to look at you [04:59] and your dog is choosing not to do it [05:01] then we can correct them so anytime i [05:04] correct a dog for behavior that i don't [05:06] want them to perform or if they're not [05:07] doing something that i'm asking them to [05:09] do for example we tell the dog sit the [05:11] dog chooses not to sit we go no we give [05:14] the dog a correction with the training [05:16] collar we repeat the command sit then we [05:18] use the leash or a lure whatever it is [05:21] to get the dog back into the position so [05:23] it's no correction recommand assist same [05:26] thing with breaking a state the dog [05:27] breaks the stay no correction recommand [05:30] assist even if the dog goes back on [05:32] their own we still correct we still [05:34] re-command if the dog's already in the [05:36] position good dog but we still go [05:38] through that same process it makes it [05:40] much easier so if the dog knows the [05:42] command and you give them a command and [05:43] they choose not to do it no correction [05:45] recommand assist if the dog's in a state [05:47] and they break the stay and they know [05:48] they have to maintain it no correction [05:50] recommand assist and it's the same with [05:52] the engagement remember everything is [05:54] based on motivation so your dog either [05:57] has to be motivated to focus on you in [05:59] order to possibly get access to a reward [06:01] or your dog has to be motivated to pay [06:03] attention to you to prevent a correction [06:05] if they choose not to pay attention to [06:07] you this is how we get our dogs to do [06:09] what we want in any given situation by [06:12] controlling the motivating factors that [06:14] determine what our dogs do just like me [06:17] i know your dogs are incredibly [06:18] important to you so having them insured [06:21] is a no-brainer keeping your dog safe [06:23] and healthy is probably one of the most [06:25] important things to you so you want to [06:26] make sure you provide them with the best [06:29] in everything that you do whether it's [06:31] the nutrition you're feeding them or the [06:33] insurance that you have to keep them [06:35] safe [06:36] prudent pet is the ultimate option to [06:38] make sure your four-legged family [06:39] members are covered and protected their [06:42] pet insurance plans cover a variety of [06:45] needs for your pet with a ton of [06:47] customizable options plus if you sign up [06:50] through my link you'll get five percent [06:52] off so don't waste any time click on the [06:54] link below and make sure you get your [06:55] pet insured how do you recommend [06:57] managing a reactive dog my girl is high [07:00] prey drive so she breaks heel whenever [07:02] she sees a rabbit bird or squirrel if [07:04] she sees another dog or jogger she [07:05] instantly starts vocalizing and lunging [07:08] what would you do in such situation [07:11] it always depends on where the dog is in [07:13] training a lot of times i go to a [07:14] session i show up and the person has a [07:16] dog that is reactive on walks this is a [07:18] common problem and i get there and the [07:20] first thing they want to do is take the [07:22] dog out on a walk well we can't do that [07:24] we can't just address the issue right [07:26] away we have to build the dog up meaning [07:28] we have to teach the dog how we [07:30] communicate with them what they need to [07:32] do if we say a certain word or a certain [07:35] sound all these communication channels [07:37] is the most important thing these [07:39] markers the stuff that i talk about all [07:41] the time so if i show up at a lesson and [07:43] they want to work with their dog being [07:45] reactive the first thing i do is the [07:47] engagement training i make sure the dog [07:49] understands the markers then i make sure [07:51] the dog knows how to follow allure this [07:53] is where we guide the dog with food they [07:55] get in the position we mark and reward [07:58] then i teach the dog leash pressure then [07:59] i start adding commands so we have all [08:02] these ways of communicating with them so [08:04] then when we take them out on a walk and [08:06] we tell them something they know what it [08:08] is that we're asking them to do now if [08:11] the behavior is based on fear and i've [08:12] talked about this in other q and a [08:14] videos you have to use what's known as [08:16] counter conditioning and desensitization [08:18] counter conditioning taking something [08:20] that they believe predicts something bad [08:21] and you make it predict something [08:22] pleasant we change what it means to the [08:24] dog by changing what it predicts [08:27] desensitization we introduce it at a [08:29] very low stimuli and we gradually [08:32] increase the stimuli as the dog becomes [08:34] more confident or proficient with what [08:36] it is that we're working on mainly [08:38] confidence so a good example would be [08:40] gunfire if you're trying to get a dog [08:41] let's say a police dog that you're [08:43] working with accustomed to gunfire you [08:44] start very far away so they could barely [08:47] hear the gunfire and then over time you [08:49] get closer and closer up until the [08:50] gunfire is not a big deal anymore again [08:53] you start at a low stimuli and you [08:54] gradually increase it as the dog becomes [08:56] more confident [08:58] now if it's not based on fear then often [09:01] we can just correct it we can tell the [09:03] dog that's not an okay behavior if you [09:05] do it you're going to receive a [09:06] correction but just like i said with the [09:08] last question we have to make sure the [09:10] dog knows what's expected of them and [09:12] they know how to turn off pressure by [09:13] complying we do that by teaching them [09:14] the commands and by teaching them leash [09:16] pressure so if i'm taking a dog on a [09:18] walk and i know they know heal and i [09:20] know they know how to maintain that [09:21] position they know the stay then i'm [09:23] going to use a correction the moment the [09:25] dog breaks the heel command and barking [09:28] is breaking the heel command heel is a [09:30] position but it also means don't be [09:32] barking and making a bunch of noise or [09:34] whining if i have a dog in a down stay [09:36] they're not allowed to bark or be [09:38] obnoxious in the down state either [09:39] that's basically a version of breaking [09:41] the stay so if i have the dog in heel [09:43] and the dog starts to break the heel [09:45] then i can give them a correction just [09:47] like i said before no correction [09:49] recommand heal assist and get them back [09:52] in the position if you are giving your [09:54] dog corrections to stop unwanted [09:56] behaviors then that means the motivation [09:59] to do the unwanted behavior is [10:01] overriding the motivation to avoid or [10:03] prevent the correction from happening if [10:05] that's the case then you have to [10:07] increase the correction there's a great [10:08] analogy that i like to teach people and [10:10] it's the speeding ticket analogy if [10:12] you're speeding down the highway and a [10:13] police officer pulls you over and writes [10:15] you a 25 cent speeding ticket you're [10:17] probably going to keep speeding but [10:19] let's say on the other extreme end of [10:21] the spectrum he pulls you over and [10:22] writes you a 100 000 speeding ticket now [10:25] you're going to avoid the behavior [10:27] entirely that's an avoidance level [10:29] correction now you're stressed you don't [10:30] want to drive but let's say you get a [10:32] 200 speeding ticket that's enough to get [10:34] you to slow down without getting you to [10:37] avoid the behavior of driving it's the [10:38] same with our dogs you have to give your [10:40] dog a speeding ticket that's appropriate [10:43] to your dog's bank account some are very [10:45] rich meaning they need a high correction [10:47] level some are very poor very low [10:49] correction level so again if you give [10:51] your dog a correction but they continue [10:52] to do the bad behavior a couple things [10:55] could be happening one either your [10:56] timing's off and your dog doesn't know [10:58] why they're being corrected [10:59] or [11:00] the corrections are not high enough and [11:02] the dog is more motivated to do the [11:04] behavior than they are to avoid the [11:06] correction so we have to increase that [11:08] another option is getting your dog [11:10] desensitized to seeing people [11:13] on skateboards or whatever other dogs [11:16] passing by a lot of times if i'm trying [11:18] to get a dog more comfortable with [11:20] seeing other dogs then i take them to a [11:22] dog park but i don't take them into the [11:24] dog park i take them outside of the dog [11:26] park and i have them watch the traffic [11:28] if i'm so close that my dog's being [11:31] reactive and barking then that means i'm [11:32] simply too close i move farther away we [11:36] decrease the stimuli to a point where [11:38] the dog can handle it as the dog is [11:40] comfortable over time we can get closer [11:42] and closer but this helps get our dogs [11:44] desensitized to it another option if you [11:47] don't want to use positive punishment [11:49] you can use leash pressure this is [11:51] something i use often if i'm working [11:53] with a dog and i'm not implementing any [11:54] sort of corrections or positive [11:56] punishment i have the dog on the walk [11:58] the dog starts to bark i say wrong [12:00] that's my marker that predicts negative [12:02] reinforcement then i use the leash to [12:04] cue the dog into the sit once the dog [12:06] stops barking then i turn off the leash [12:08] pressure and again leash pressure once [12:11] it's turned on can't be turned off until [12:12] they comply once they comply instantly [12:14] turned off so then the dog learns if [12:17] they want the pressure to be turned off [12:19] they have to be quiet and sit properly [12:21] so that's another great option and if [12:23] you realize your dog doesn't know any of [12:25] the training yet and you're trying to [12:27] work with this dog then go back teach [12:29] the markers [12:30] get your dog to understand all the [12:31] different positions using luring teach [12:34] leash pressure teach the stay add the [12:36] commands make sure you do all the [12:38] appropriate steps so then when you are [12:40] in a situation you can communicate [12:42] effectively with your dog showing your [12:44] dog clear expectations of what you want [12:45] them to do in that situation how do i [12:48] cut my dog's nails without having to do [12:50] a sneak attack while she is asleep [12:52] she allows me to touch her paws just [12:54] won't let the clippers get close [12:57] all right when it comes to cutting our [12:58] dog's nails there's a couple options one [13:00] take your dog to the local groomer and [13:02] have them do it that's what i like to do [13:04] or we can also just make them do it so a [13:07] lot of times when we're trying to get [13:09] our dogs to do something if we just make [13:11] them do it then they start to realize [13:14] that there is no option they just have [13:16] to do it if you're trying to get your [13:18] dog to do something and your dog resists [13:20] and whatever they're doing to resist [13:22] what you want them to do works then they [13:24] continue to do that behavior so for [13:26] example let's say you're trying to put a [13:28] collar on your dog you go to put it on [13:30] and your dog starts biting at your hand [13:32] not hard but mouthing at your hand and [13:34] you go oh i better not put that collar [13:36] on well now the dog knows that biting at [13:39] your hand is going to prevent you from [13:40] putting the collar on the dog and the [13:42] dog's going to continue that behavior if [13:44] i'm going to cut a dog's nails and [13:47] they're mouthing at me or they're [13:49] whining or whatever it is that they're [13:50] doing [13:52] and i stop then they know that that [13:54] behavior works and they continue to do [13:56] that behavior as long as the dog is not [13:58] afraid of the nail clippers then i just [14:01] cut their nails i just [14:03] make them do it i don't give them an [14:04] option and again once they know that [14:06] they don't have an option [14:08] then they're more willing to let you do [14:10] it because they know there's not an [14:11] option [14:12] if they learn that they can fight or [14:14] resist and that works then they will [14:16] continue to do that behavior if you have [14:18] a dog that's afraid of it then you have [14:20] to go back to the counter conditioning [14:21] and desensitization you have to [14:23] introduce the dog to it very slowly [14:25] maybe bring out the clippers mark and [14:27] reward maybe make some noise mark and [14:29] reward and just slowly over time get [14:32] your dog comfortable with it by pairing [14:34] with pairing something [14:36] pleasant with the clippers so it creates [14:38] that strong positive association this [14:40] takes a very long time [14:42] but it does work it just takes time you [14:44] have to get the dog comfortable with it [14:46] like i said though the dog's not afraid [14:48] i just make them do it and that's what [14:50] most groomers are gonna do as well they [14:52] don't have time to start getting a dog [14:54] comfortable with their nails getting [14:56] clipped they just do it and then they [14:58] move on to the next dog so that's one of [15:00] the most [15:02] successful options is just making them [15:04] do it if the dog tries to be aggressive [15:07] then maybe muzzle training the dog could [15:09] be a good option before you start [15:11] clipping their nails so safety is always [15:13] important and if the dog is afraid of it [15:15] we want to do that counter conditioning [15:17] as well as getting them desensitized to [15:20] it by [15:21] a good amount of exposure uh but yeah [15:24] simple answer i wish i could give you [15:26] more but like i said take the dog to the [15:29] groomer have them do it just [15:31] do it don't let the dog try to stop you [15:33] from doing it make sure they understand [15:35] that if you're going to cut their nails [15:36] you're going to do it [15:38] or get them comfortable with it counter [15:40] conditioning desensitization [15:42] and let them know that the clippers [15:44] actually mean something pleasant and not [15:46] something unpleasant as that's what a [15:49] dog often thinks if they're afraid of [15:51] something they think maybe something bad [15:52] or unpleasant's gonna come from it so we [15:54] do that counter conditioning how do you [15:56] train fetch and retrieve with an adult [15:58] dog who doesn't seem to understand the [16:00] game [16:00] if i'm trying to teach a dog how to [16:02] retrieve or how to play fetch well first [16:05] it depends on if i'm teaching a formal [16:07] retrieve so if i'm doing something for [16:08] like let's say service dog training and [16:10] the dog has to pick up keys that have [16:12] been dropped the process for teaching [16:14] that is way different than when we teach [16:16] a dog fetch so fetch is more of a game [16:19] now the first thing is we want to make [16:21] sure the dog has a good amount of toy [16:23] drive they're willing to chase the toy [16:26] one of my favorite exercises that i like [16:28] to do to build a dog's toy drive it's [16:30] known as drive building you can see a [16:32] modified version of it in my how to [16:34] teach your dog to bark video but [16:36] basically you have your dog on a back [16:38] tie you tease your dog with a toy when [16:40] your dog gets excited you reward them [16:42] with the toy and then you play kind of [16:44] like a tug sort of game with them if [16:46] they drop the toy you tease them some [16:48] more so you want to get them to want to [16:50] hold on to the toy that's a big part of [16:53] it i also like to work with dogs with [16:54] ball on a rope so then if the ball is [16:57] attached to a rope you can have them [16:59] chase it once they grab the ball you [17:01] keep the ball active even after they [17:03] have it so what happens with a lot of [17:05] dogs is they'll grab the toy the toy [17:07] will no longer be active that makes them [17:10] bored and they drop the toy if we keep [17:12] the toy active in their mouth by keeping [17:14] it alive using the string that's [17:16] attached to it they're more likely to [17:18] hold on to it so i want to teach the dog [17:20] to hold on to the toy [17:22] once i have that down so i have a dog [17:24] that's going to chase a toy and i have a [17:25] dog that's going to hold on to the toy [17:27] then i can start playing fetch i do have [17:29] a video on this i like to i like to use [17:32] what's known as value transfer so i get [17:35] two balls that are identical not an old [17:38] version and a new version no two [17:40] identical so two brand new tennis balls [17:42] or chuck it balls whatever it is that [17:44] we're using we throw the first ball and [17:46] we make sure our dog is on a long line [17:48] our dog goes out and gets the ball once [17:50] they get the ball we can use the long [17:52] line to guide them back to us hoping [17:54] that they don't drop the toy because [17:56] we've worked with them so they want to [17:57] hold the toy now because we've done the [17:59] the training beforehand we get the dog [18:02] to us we show the new toy the dog drops [18:05] the old toy and then we throw the new [18:06] toy bringing out the new toy ends up [18:09] being the drop it command so your dog [18:12] comes over if you know presenting the [18:14] new toy gets them to drop the old toy [18:16] you can add a command so your dog comes [18:18] over drop it bring the new toy out the [18:21] dog drops the old toy free and then you [18:23] throw the new toy and your dog goes and [18:24] gets that and you repeat that process [18:27] but the main thing that people struggle [18:28] with is getting the dog to fetch it so [18:30] you have to build that toy drive and [18:32] getting the dog to hold on to it they [18:35] must hold on to it and again we do that [18:37] by using a ball on a rope and we keep [18:39] the ball active when it's in their mouth [18:41] they you want them to want to hold on to [18:43] it if they're not holding on to it and [18:45] you can pull it out of their mouth using [18:46] the rope then you tease them with it [18:48] once it slips out of their mouth you [18:49] start teasing them now they're chasing [18:51] it now next time they get it they want [18:52] to hang on to it even [18:54] harder than they were before so we want [18:56] the dog to hold on to it then again we [18:58] use the long line we get the dog back to [19:00] us drop it command bring out the new toy [19:03] they drop the old one we throw the new [19:04] one and we just continue to repeat this [19:07] process your dog will quickly learn the [19:09] game they go out they get the toy they [19:11] come back they drop it in front of you [19:13] you throw them a new toy and you just [19:14] continue to do this and it shouldn't [19:16] take too long before you have a dog that [19:18] can play fetch how can i make my dog [19:20] more focused and enthusiastic like the [19:23] dogs in your videos my dog seems to lose [19:25] interest after she gets two or three [19:27] rewards when i'm training her [19:29] okay so this is very similar to the [19:31] first question this falls back on [19:33] engagement training if i'm working with [19:35] a dog and that dog just doesn't have [19:36] that much focus i bring the dog out it's [19:39] it's known as food deprivation but the [19:42] thing is we're not [19:44] preventing the dog or we're not refusing [19:46] food it's the dog is not training so we [19:49] bring the dog out and we say hey you [19:51] want to train [19:52] and the dog says no i don't want to [19:54] train and we say okay no problem we'll [19:56] try again later [19:58] the issue that people run into is they [20:00] feed their dog or they do free feeding [20:03] meaning they just have a bowl filled [20:04] with food and then they wonder why the [20:06] dog doesn't want to work for food well [20:08] the dog has free access to food 24 7 so [20:11] why would the dog possibly want to work [20:13] for it [20:14] if i'm trying to get really strong [20:16] engagement from a dog and this is also [20:18] why the puppy imprinting stage is so [20:20] important those first 16 weeks of a [20:22] dog's life during that time we're trying [20:24] to really build up the dog's drive their [20:26] motivation to want to train their food [20:28] drive the toy drive [20:30] all these things we're trying to build [20:32] so then when they get older we can use [20:34] this [20:35] for training and it becomes much easier [20:37] but again if i'm working with a dog and [20:39] they don't have that much engagement [20:41] that much interest in what i'm doing [20:43] then i have to increase it by increasing [20:45] the value of what i'm having the dog [20:46] work for so bring your dog out start [20:49] working with your dog the moment your [20:51] dog loses interest [20:52] no big deal pick your dog up put your [20:55] dog back inside in the crate and then [20:57] don't [20:58] feed your dog again until you train in [21:01] the evening bring your dog out in the [21:03] evening for training start working with [21:04] your dog if you lose interest or you [21:06] lose focus good put your dog away [21:09] showing your dog that if they lose focus [21:11] on you the food goes away [21:13] and i can almost guarantee that if you [21:15] do this correctly you're going to start [21:17] getting way more engagement and way more [21:20] focus from your dog because your dog's [21:22] going to realize that they want to eat [21:24] then they have to work for and if they [21:25] want to work for it they have to [21:27] maintain focus on you and of course this [21:30] is going to transfer to everything else [21:31] teaching commands teaching the stay [21:34] anything precision obedience having that [21:36] focus is very important and we can do [21:38] that simply by using this technique one [21:40] more time you bring your dog out start [21:42] training the moment you lose focus put [21:44] your dog away no yelling no getting [21:46] upset nothing like that cause and effect [21:48] you lose focus you go in your crate you [21:51] maintain focus i'll continue feeding you [21:53] and your dog's gonna figure that out [21:55] really fast [21:56] very important don't let anybody in the [21:58] family or any friends give the dog food [22:02] or treats or anything in between [22:04] training make your dog work for every [22:06] bite of food that they have and that's [22:08] going to greatly increase the amount of [22:10] focus and attention that you get from [22:11] your dog during training [22:13]

The school he founded is the culmination of that passion, and their students and graduates share his dedication. Over the past four decades, TRS graduated a major percentage of the foremost trainers in the world. Employers snap up at their alumni.  Those who start their own businesses succeed consistently. One very successful graduate put it this way,  “There is no other school with the experience and instructional track record of TRS. There is no other school that teaches many different training techniques, then encourages the student to choose the methods most comfortable for them."" Tom authored three major dog-training books. He won training competitions time after time with dogs he raised and trained. He pioneered and developed the celebrated Puppy Imprinting Program. He coined the phrase ""imprinting"" as it applies to dogs.  He is the first to import the Belgian Malinois breed to the United States. Graduation from TRS depends upon successfully accomplishing industry-recognized objectives and requirements. The Tom Rose School curriculum is proven effective in meeting and exceeding those requirements. Lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on experience guide you to accomplish objectives that would take a talented trainer ten years to learn on their own."

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 255/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode thanks again for joining us i'm [00:03] here at the tom rose school for [00:05] professional dog trainers and in today's [00:07] video tom rose is going to be working [00:09] with some of his students teaching them [00:11] how to do a straight track or how he [00:13] likes to introduce the straight track to [00:15] the dogs if you're going to learn from [00:16] somebody when it comes to tracking tom [00:18] rose is definitely the person to learn [00:20] from he is the first american ever to [00:22] score a perfect in the fh track so let's [00:25] go ahead and get started and now we're [00:27] going to begin straight lines so he's [00:29] going to put down a flag [00:32] he's going to pick up a line up so he [00:34] can walk perfectly straight right now [00:36] he's in line with the edge of the second [00:39] blind [00:40] and a tree [00:42] growing right behind it he'll be [00:43] watching that as he lays the track [00:46] walking perfectly straight [00:51] and he's going to put food in each [00:53] footstep [00:54] as he walks so he'll step [00:57] and step back a little bit drop a piece [00:59] of food step back a little bit [01:02] and put a piece of food [01:04] then need to step that far just slightly [01:07] like that yeah step this a little bit [01:09] back [01:11] well you don't yeah don't need to go [01:13] that far [01:14] just scoot back six inches and drop [01:17] the food where the footprint was [01:27] step scoop back a little bit and put it [01:29] where the foot was that's it okay [01:33] same thing [01:35] so he's walking a perfectly straight [01:37] line we've got food in every step [01:40] he's going to go about twice as far as [01:42] he's already gone [01:46] now since we taught the dog while he was [01:49] in the tracking box and working [01:51] that if he pulled on us [01:53] he should disregard any leash pressure [01:55] while he's in the [01:57] tracking box as [01:59] when he's on a straight line [02:01] therefore if he would [02:03] wander off the straight line we can pull [02:05] away and hopefully he will re [02:09] act by pulling an equal in opposite [02:11] direction which would take him right [02:13] back to the track [02:16] obviously it's very important that the [02:18] track layer know exactly where the track [02:21] is ultimately we'll put an article at [02:23] the end but for now we're just going to [02:25] put a flag at the end [02:27] soon the dog will realize the flag is [02:29] the end and start racing towards the [02:30] flag at that point we're going to have [02:33] to remove the flag and put something [02:35] different [02:37] you could put an article with a piece of [02:39] food on top plant your flag make a big [02:41] jump off of it [02:44] now aging the track pertains to how long [02:46] the track is there before we actually [02:49] run it with the dog [02:51] and in this case we're not going to age [02:53] it at all we're just going to go get the [02:54] dog and run it immediately [02:57] because all the dog is really looking [02:59] for at this point is food going to hold [03:00] the leash short in a lot of cases i tell [03:03] people to put the dog between your feet [03:06] as you run the track uh while they were [03:08] in the tracking box they were able to [03:10] spin in circles we don't want them to do [03:12] that here so a lot of dogs first time [03:14] they do the straight line are going to [03:16] have a tendency to want to circle so put [03:18] him right between your legs hold the [03:20] leash right between your legs and track [03:22] him in between your feet [03:26] here [03:32] check [03:54] so at this point he's obviously guiding [03:56] the dog but in the process the dog is [03:59] learning [04:02] that there is food there is learning [04:04] what it's supposed to do [04:16] and you notice there's a strong tendency [04:17] to want to look back and go behind [04:19] probably she's missing food she smells [04:21] it she wants to turn around [04:23] also we had mentioned that best in the [04:26] beginning to lay tracks into the wind [04:28] today there is no wind [04:33] so at the end you can just praise her [04:35] pick her up and take her off the track [04:36] you pick up your flag [04:38] okay this is our next in progression [04:40] with the straight line tracks [04:42] uh this should be this track beginning [04:44] here [04:45] only different is we have an article at [04:47] the end to mark the end although he's [04:49] also got a flag i don't have an article [04:51] you don't have an article at the end [04:53] okay so this is exactly the same as the [04:54] other track okay [04:56] is that all right yeah go ahead and do [04:58] it [04:58] free [05:00] track [05:06] very easy to see where he walked [05:11] keeping the dog between his feet [05:13] dog is not circling [05:25] missing some food but getting most [05:30] i kind of like it when they start [05:31] missing food because that tells me [05:33] they're paying more attention to the [05:35] track than the food [05:40] so dog is doing a good job he's not [05:43] circling so he the handler can let the [05:45] dog out a little bit more let it maybe [05:47] another foot of leash [05:49] if he doesn't circle you could give him [05:51] another foot yet [06:05] he got off it quickly got back on [06:15] maybe that lay him out a little bit [06:16] further as you near the end [06:18] might mention that all this is very well [06:20] outlined in my book train with the touch [06:24] step by step [06:31] now we did not place an article at the [06:33] end we do have a flag [06:38] and he gave us real good what we call [06:39] track loss indication when he hit the [06:41] end of the flag at the track he [06:43] immediately knew he was at the end and [06:45] he turned around and double back [06:49] now the next time we lay this we're [06:50] going to pull the flag and put [06:53] an article at the end [06:55] as you probably know from reading the [06:56] book we would [06:58] begin the track exactly as you saw here [07:01] then the next step [07:02] we would re-run that same track [07:06] using the bait that the dog missed to [07:09] get them to go through the track [07:11] if there's not enough missed bait then [07:14] we would need to what we call re-salted [07:16] or re-baited so the dog will be [07:19] successful once they're doing that [07:21] pretty well we'll lay three tracks [07:24] one [07:25] fairly short like this one one maybe [07:27] twice that length maybe one three times [07:29] that length we would run the last track [07:32] first the one that's three times as long [07:35] second track second and the first track [07:37] third [07:39] by doing this we're getting the dog used [07:40] to aging we could also re-run those same [07:44] tracks with the dog finding the bait [07:47] that they missed the first time [07:49] as i said the argument against this is [07:51] if the dog is really doing a good job [07:54] and he's getting all the bait you're [07:55] going to have to as i said a minute ago [07:57] re-salt the track before redoing it but [08:00] what's happening now is a ground [08:02] disturbance in human sense is becoming [08:04] overwhelming and the dog is we hope [08:08] beginning to find that scent instead of [08:11] the bait scent and also when we re-salt [08:14] the scent we don't put near as much on [08:16] it we may put a piece and then walk [08:19] three steps and put a piece walk five [08:21] steps and put two pieces walk [08:25] nine steps and put three pieces and go [08:27] back to the next one five steps and two [08:29] pieces and go through that way but we're [08:32] not going to have food in every [08:33] footprint [08:35] okay this next one now is going to [08:36] demonstrate the first track with an [08:39] article now the dog has worked articles [08:42] in the training building as you've seen [08:45] he knows what to do he knows to go down [08:47] he knows the indicator he knows not to [08:48] play with it so now it's time that we [08:51] can use an article rather than a flag at [08:53] the end [08:54] as i mentioned before if you always have [08:56] a flag at the end the dog is just going [08:58] to simply go to the flag [09:00] so we need to get to articles at the end [09:03] as soon as possible if you've done your [09:05] work properly you've trained articles [09:07] and tracking simultaneously this should [09:09] be not even an issue [09:11] okay so it's the first time i do the [09:14] the article in the trial right [09:16] yeah download the article should i um [09:19] pick her up and put her and say try or [09:22] let her it doesn't matter don't lead her [09:24] to it if you want to okay [09:27] that's all i lose [09:32] track [09:38] now this handler has confidence that the [09:41] dog isn't going to spin so she's [09:42] standing a little bit further back [09:44] as long as you know that the dog is not [09:47] going to spin you can do that but again [09:50] with the zero tolerance concept [09:53] we don't want the dog to even make the [09:54] mistake once [09:56] so if she would misjudge and the dog [09:58] would spin she'd be creating a problem [10:01] there's almost tried so you might get a [10:03] little closer [10:04] and kind of ride the dog along the track [10:07] there you go [10:10] it's planning to be much more prevalent [10:12] when there's less food [10:15] this food is heavily baited i think [10:17] she's using chicken for bait [10:20] it concerns me a little bit using a lot [10:22] of chicken a lot of meat sometimes it'll [10:24] create diarrhea [10:27] i prefer to use bill jack because it's a [10:29] balanced diet [10:39] and probably the pieces could be [10:41] half the size that you see because it's [10:43] taken the dog much too long to eat them [10:50] not to mention [10:51] the dog being [10:53] not hungry later on when she wants to do [10:55] obedience [11:00] somebody once made the same [11:03] watching the dog track is kind of like [11:05] watching paint dry [11:06] pretty boring if you're doing it it's [11:09] not as boring but it's still [11:12] boring at this step once they're doing [11:15] felon tracks and actual tracks it gets [11:18] to be a whole bunch of fun it's a lot of [11:20] fun but the beginning stages are pretty [11:22] uneventful [11:25] puppy's doing a really good job still no [11:28] spinning [11:29] completely out of control going forward [11:31] the whole time [11:35] now this is a beginning track [11:37] and what i mentioned a minute ago about [11:39] lane three tracks running them backwards [11:42] running them a second time has not been [11:45] done but she said the dog is very good [11:47] on articles so we're doing this [11:49] primarily to demonstrate [11:51] how the dog will react when it sees an [11:53] article [11:59] i think she's going to have eaten the [12:00] whole chicken by the time we finish [12:05] so she spotted the fact that dog was [12:07] turning it doesn't look like there's [12:09] much food between here and the article [12:11] which could be oh we're getting a spin [12:13] okay [12:15] did that was a big mistake we don't want [12:17] that to happen plus [12:18] down down [12:20] down [12:21] yes and then she's going to do the magic [12:23] truck under the article for the food [12:26] okay most common problems that we see [12:28] with tracking are people allowing the [12:31] dog to spin to turn make circles [12:35] they're not controlling the dog [12:37] the dog obviously is going to put his [12:38] nose down because you wouldn't have [12:40] graduated from the tracking box to the [12:42] straight line unless the dog was [12:44] performing perfectly in the tracking box [12:46] so generally on these beginning tracks [12:48] the only issue we encounter is dogs [12:51] turning and spinning if they lacked [12:54] interest didn't want to do it we'd go [12:56] back and rework the tracking box until [12:58] we get it straightened out thanks again [13:00] for watching us i had a blast i hope you [13:02] had a good time as well and as always [13:04] like subscribe hit that

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 258/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we'll be going over some of the [00:02] most common tools used in the dog [00:04] training industry [00:05] even though i don't personally use all [00:07] of them it's important to understand how [00:09] they work so you can be prepared if [00:11] you're required to use them and remember [00:14] that our training tools are a means to [00:16] an end and what's that end well it's a [00:18] well-trained dog that knows how to [00:20] navigate in our world in ways that other [00:23] dogs don't [00:25] binder [00:27] after acquiring your puppy or dog it's [00:29] an excellent idea to not only ensure [00:31] your dog is properly vaccinated but that [00:34] you also have copies available of all [00:36] the information and medical records i [00:38] feel the simplest solution is to keep a [00:40] binder available with all these [00:42] essential documents such as veterinarian [00:44] records the puppy's birth certificate [00:47] any contracts related to the purchase [00:49] and your puppy's records if given [00:52] training vest or pouch [00:54] if you've been following my training you [00:56] know that anytime we start teaching a [00:58] dog a new behavior or command we always [01:01] begin with continual reinforcement [01:03] meaning we reward every correct behavior [01:06] this means we have a lot of treats on us [01:09] while training one of the easiest ways [01:11] to do this is with a training vest or [01:13] pouch however it's also important to [01:16] train your dog on occasions without a [01:17] vest or pouch so your dog doesn't look [01:20] for the pouch when you ask them to do a [01:21] command [01:22] proactive dog training will also help [01:24] with this [01:26] clickers [01:28] marker training is the foundation of [01:30] everything we do in the dog training [01:32] world i usually prefer not to use a [01:34] clicker because i would rather use my [01:36] voice however if you're going to use [01:38] your voice it's essential to know why [01:40] clickers are so successful one the click [01:43] always sounds the same which makes it [01:45] easier for the dog to become conditioned [01:47] to it two it's very distinct sound that [01:49] is clearly separated from our voice [01:52] third it's much easier to separate two [01:54] physicals than it is to separate a [01:56] physical and a verbal [01:59] flat nylon or leather collars these [02:01] collars are basic functional collars [02:03] they can hold your dog's dog tags and [02:06] provide some leash pressure when used [02:07] with a leash [02:09] martingale collar this is similar to the [02:11] pinch collar as far as the use and [02:13] application however this collar works [02:15] well on dogs with a low correction level [02:17] meaning if the dog is very sensitive to [02:20] corrections this collar usually doesn't [02:22] provide enough of a correction for dogs [02:25] that have a higher correction level and [02:27] it's also used to prevent dogs from [02:29] slipping their heads out of the collar [02:30] which is very helpful when teaching [02:32] leash pressure [02:34] pinch collar or prong collar [02:36] this is one of the most commonly used [02:38] training collars on the market if your [02:40] dog pulls on the leash it will tighten [02:42] the collar creating a pinching sensation [02:44] around the dog's neck once the dog stops [02:47] pulling the pressure will stop this can [02:49] also prevent issues during training by [02:51] popping on the leash when the dog does [02:53] an undesired behavior when the leash [02:55] pops it will activate the collar [02:57] creating a pinching sensation around the [02:59] dog's neck however when used this way [03:02] the correction only lasts a split second [03:04] this is a very safe and effective tool [03:07] when used correctly the most popular [03:09] brand amongst professional dog trainers [03:11] is herm springer [03:13] remote training collars these are also [03:16] known as shock collars when these [03:18] collars are used correctly they are [03:19] perfectly safe in fact many would [03:22] consider the remote training collar to [03:24] be the safest and most effective [03:25] training tool for dogs this is also the [03:28] only way to get a dog to have a full off [03:30] leash reliable recall as well as [03:32] off-leash reliability it's imperative to [03:35] note though that ethical consideration [03:36] arises when used by inexperienced [03:39] negligent or careless trainers so make [03:42] sure you have the proper training before [03:43] using one of these on your dog two [03:46] popular brands currently in uses dogtra [03:48] and e-collar technologies chokechain [03:51] this collar has the potential to be [03:53] dangerous when attached to the live ring [03:55] this is the one that tightens when it is [03:57] pulled and can cause really lifelong [04:01] injuries to your dog however skilled dog [04:03] trainers can use this collar correctly [04:05] without it being a risk to their dog's [04:06] health so i would suggest unless you're [04:09] an expert i would stay away from it side [04:12] note many trainers also use this as a [04:14] dummy collar which we'll cover next [04:17] dummy collar in the sport of igp a [04:19] protection sport a dog is allowed to [04:22] wear a choke chain or fur saver while [04:24] testing but not the remote collar so [04:26] some competitors use the choke chain [04:28] that imitates a remote collar they teach [04:30] the dog that it is the remote collar at [04:32] least that's what they believe so the [04:34] dog behaves as though it's wearing the [04:36] collar i'll explain how to do this in a [04:38] future video [04:39] gentle leader or halti this collar is [04:42] designed to control the dog's head as [04:44] well as give you the ability to close a [04:46] dog's mouth by lifting up [04:48] just like any training tool this can be [04:50] a safe option when working on specific [04:52] issues however when misused it has the [04:55] potential to cause neck and spinal cord [04:57] injuries [04:58] so use with caution [05:00] no pull harness [05:02] many canine health professionals advise [05:04] staying away from these types of [05:05] harnesses since they are considered [05:08] detrimental to a dog's structure and [05:10] gait and since you're learning how to be [05:12] a dog trainer i suggest teaching them [05:15] not to pull instead of using this tool [05:18] agitation collar these collars are much [05:21] thicker than normal flat collars they [05:23] are designed to allow the dog to pull [05:25] much like a harness does trainers will [05:28] often use these collars for protection [05:30] dog training [05:32] hardness [05:33] these are excellent and highly [05:35] recommended for when you want your dog [05:37] to pull [05:38] during protection training i use a [05:40] harness to build a dog's confidence and [05:43] i also use it when i'm exercising my [05:45] dogs there are multiple different types [05:47] of harnesses that can be used on a dog [05:49] some are designed to pull and others can [05:51] be used for working dogs such as a [05:53] service dog vest [05:56] the leash [05:57] i like to use four different types of [05:58] leashes when training a dog the first is [06:00] a basic four foot or six foot leash the [06:03] second is a 20 to 30 foot long line the [06:06] third is the flexi leash that's a [06:08] retractable one and the fourth is called [06:10] a tab which is anywhere from a 4 inch to [06:13] 12 inch short leash i like to use a tab [06:15] when i'm house training a dog and it [06:17] gives me the ability to maintain control [06:19] the dog without the risk of the leash [06:21] getting caught on furniture when the dog [06:23] or puppy is running around [06:25] healing stick teaches a dog how to [06:27] respond when it's felt in a particular [06:30] part of the body so as to cue the dog [06:32] and manipulate their body for precision [06:35] obedience objectives it's similar to [06:37] each pressure as it's just one [06:39] additional tool to improve the [06:40] communication with the dog using [06:42] negative reinforcement it's not used to [06:45] hit the dog or any other form of [06:47] positive punishment [06:49] toys [06:50] toys are excellent for not only bonding [06:52] with your dog but can also be an [06:54] excellent motivator for obedience [06:56] training just be sure never to leave a [06:59] puppy or dog unintended with a toy and [07:01] this really is for safety and it's a [07:03] concern because many puppies or dogs [07:05] will try to eat their toys which can [07:07] cause health issues such as a ruptured [07:09] bowel or blockage and possibly death [07:12] the crate if you're still house training [07:15] or potty training then you'll need a [07:16] creep during the potty training process [07:18] it's essential to initially have a crate [07:20] that's only larger than your dog or [07:22] puppy with enough space to stand up turn [07:25] around and lay down this will help teach [07:27] the dog to hold their bladder since dogs [07:29] don't like to go potty where they eat or [07:31] where they sleep and if your dog is [07:33] already potty trained a bigger crate is [07:35] completely acceptable [07:38] dog bed this will help your puppy or dog [07:40] learn to adjust to their own space of [07:43] comfort [07:44] we use a popular command called the [07:46] climb command which teaches a dog to go [07:48] to their bed and stay until given the [07:50] release word a new command or the [07:52] terminal marker this is very easy to [07:55] teach when you know the proper steps dog [07:58] gate if you want to control where the [08:00] dog goes within the household then use [08:02] puppy or dog gates these will restrict [08:04] the dog from going in and out of certain [08:06] rooms that can be installed in most [08:08] doorways and it's worth using this until [08:11] you have trained your dog to respect and [08:13] understand boundaries as well as [08:14] invisible barriers [08:17] puppy pen [08:18] this is a good idea if you want your [08:20] puppy to run around and play but you [08:22] want to limit access to the rest of the [08:24] house while your puppy is in the puppy [08:26] pen i still recommend keeping eyes on [08:28] them 100 of the time [08:30] hey it's nate gilmer thank you so much [08:32] for watching and subscribing to these

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 262/841,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another episode here on [00:02] the nate shoamer dog training channel [00:04] today we'll be doing a q a with [00:06] professional dog trainer and dog trainer [00:09] instructor tom rose [00:11] tom has written multiple books on dog [00:13] training in fact i always like to keep a [00:15] copy of dog training with the touch [00:17] nearby [00:18] over the past four decades tom rose has [00:21] graduated successful dog trainers all [00:23] over the world in fact his graduates [00:25] achieve financial success win [00:27] competitions write books develop [00:30] successful dog training schools and head [00:32] law enforcement k-9 units he's won [00:35] training competitions time after time [00:37] with the dogs that he has raised and [00:39] trained he was the first american to [00:41] ever score perfect on fh track he [00:44] pioneered and developed the celebrated [00:46] puppy imprinting program he coined the [00:48] phrase imprinting as it applies to dogs [00:51] and he is the first to import the [00:53] belgian malinois breed to the united [00:55] states it's always an honor for me to [00:58] have him on my channel and to take the [01:00] time to answer your dog training [01:02] questions so let's not waste any more [01:04] time and get started please welcome tom [01:06] rose [01:07] the question [01:09] if a dog does something is not supposed [01:12] to do [01:13] how do you discipline in a positive way [01:17] all the time [01:21] my response to that would be [01:24] i don't think there is a positive way [01:27] to stop [01:28] behaviors [01:29] such as potting in the house chewing on [01:32] furniture [01:34] etc outside of making a correction [01:39] there are those that would say that the [01:41] best thing you could do would be to stop [01:44] the dog from behavior [01:46] for instance if it's potting in the [01:47] house [01:49] grab the puppy and take it outside [01:51] immediately if it's chewing on furniture [01:54] remove that piece of furniture remove [01:56] the puppy from the furniture [01:58] keep it someplace where it can't and [02:00] become involved in that activity again [02:05] basically that has not worked well for [02:07] me in the past [02:08] i really do feel the best thing you can [02:10] do is to make a correction [02:13] the question is [02:14] what about laser guided retrieves [02:18] it's a great way to do we use it [02:20] frequently [02:21] and training service dogs [02:24] however i've discovered that some dogs [02:27] are not aware of the laser they don't [02:30] seem to look at it they don't seem [02:32] interested in it at all [02:34] others are very interested i think if [02:36] you screen the dog that you're going to [02:38] train and you pick one that is [02:40] definitely interested in following the [02:43] laser pointer it's a real good way [02:46] to direct a dog for a retrieve [02:49] this is particularly useful when [02:51] training service dogs [02:52] for instance a dog to pick up a key off [02:55] the floor or to go get something that [02:57] the individual wants you point the laser [03:01] kind of lead a path over to where you're [03:03] going to have the dog retrieve the item [03:06] and [03:07] the dog will follow and pick it up and [03:09] bring it back [03:10] so in my opinion it's a very good method [03:14] the question is how do you become a [03:16] professional trainer [03:19] my obvious answer to that is come to my [03:21] school [03:23] it takes a long time and a lot of [03:25] experience to get [03:27] to the point [03:29] that you are comfortable and work with [03:31] people [03:32] and [03:33] dispensing the proper information to [03:36] help them with their dog [03:38] i remember when i was learning [03:40] there was no school available to go to [03:43] i spent a lot of times in europe i [03:46] worked with every trainer i could find [03:48] and it seemed like it was forever [03:51] that i was answering questions based on [03:54] what someone told me rather than [03:56] experience [03:58] so i think coming to a school that [04:00] allows you to do a lot of hands-on [04:03] work with your dog is very effective [04:06] in becoming [04:08] a a successful [04:10] professional trainer and working with [04:13] other [04:14] people and directing them as to what the [04:17] proper training techniques are for their [04:20] particular dog [04:22] the question is in my opinion is the [04:25] verbal cue or clicker training more [04:27] effective than communicating with the [04:29] dog is it okay [04:31] to combine both [04:33] basically i use a special noise [04:37] or a word or something to reward the dog [04:42] as opposed to using a clicker to signal [04:45] a reward [04:46] the problem with the clicker is you may [04:48] not always have it with you [04:50] and then you become inconsistent [04:53] i find in working with clients that [04:55] frequent exactly what happens [04:58] they come and say well i left my clicker [05:00] on the counter [05:02] and when my dog did something correctly [05:04] i was unable to make the [05:07] signal that he had done something [05:09] correctly [05:11] so [05:12] in other words i think if you always [05:14] have [05:15] your special noise with you obviously [05:18] some noise or sound that you make [05:21] that's going to be more consistent than [05:23] using another device [05:26] the question however was can you use [05:28] both [05:30] yes i guess you can [05:32] but i think it's just confusing using [05:34] two different signals [05:36] for [05:37] proper behavior [05:40] the question is how do you [05:42] discourage play binding of hands without [05:45] discouraging biting on other things such [05:47] as a tug [05:49] i've heard this many times in my [05:52] experience [05:55] i don't allow my puppies to bite on me [05:58] bite on my arms bite on my hands i don't [06:00] put on a pair of gloves and play with a [06:02] dog and have them bite me i think it's [06:04] bad practice [06:06] as far as discouraged them from biting [06:08] on my hands i have not found it had any [06:11] effect whatsoever [06:13] on future bodying of tugs sleeves suits [06:16] whatever [06:17] i think the dog understands that's not [06:20] proper to bite me but it is property [06:23] bite on the tug [06:25] the question is my three-month-old puppy [06:27] gets excited about seeing [06:29] people i want to socialize him but i may [06:32] be overdoing it making him too friendly [06:35] please advise how to handle this [06:37] situation [06:38] i would continue what you're doing i [06:40] think socialization of the puppy is very [06:43] important i like to have them around as [06:46] many people as possible [06:48] exposing to as many new things as [06:50] possible [06:51] i don't believe it's necessary to have [06:53] people carry your puppy around [06:56] or [06:57] snuggle with it that sort of thing but i [06:59] don't want my puppy to grow up being [07:02] afraid of strangers [07:04] when i first started training [07:06] the person that i was working with on [07:08] guard dog training said that if you want [07:11] to develop a guard dog keep your dog [07:14] away from everyone [07:16] for instance keep him in the basement in [07:18] a crate when people arrive [07:20] don't let him socialize with people [07:23] and i found that often times these [07:25] puppies would grow up being fearful [07:27] and yes they would [07:29] bark and growl and act aggressive [07:31] towards strangers because they were [07:33] afraid of them [07:34] but when it came to bite work i had [07:37] serious problems [07:39] so my answer is continue what you're [07:41] doing [07:42] socialization is a very important part [07:45] of developing your puppy [07:48] the question is my dog nunu attended [07:52] group [07:52] training school for four months [07:55] she did very well in class had no fear [07:58] and was very confident but when she [08:01] entered the animal hospital [08:04] she began to shake and was very nervous [08:06] she never showed any aggression towards [08:09] people or other animals i don't know how [08:12] to improve her confidence in the [08:14] hospital [08:16] what advice do i have [08:18] basically [08:19] i think in this particular situation [08:22] it's not uncommon for dogs to become [08:25] fearful when they enter an animal [08:27] hospital i don't know if it's the smell [08:30] or it's the formal situation [08:33] what it might be [08:34] however [08:36] if the dog is not biting the doctor or [08:39] acting aggressively as a result of the [08:42] fear i wouldn't be real concerned about [08:44] it [08:45] however if you wanted to get the dog [08:47] over the fear [08:49] it might be helpful [08:50] if it's agreeable with your veterinarian [08:53] to take the dog to the veterinarian if [08:55] he's close by more often [08:58] and just go in and play with him lightly [09:01] or maybe give him some treats and then [09:03] leave again [09:04] the more often you [09:06] do this i think the more confident the [09:08] dog is going to be and the less worried [09:11] he'll be about the circumstances [09:13] and what age should you start training a [09:15] puppy so they won't eventually develop [09:18] separation anxiety [09:20] and what is the best way to go about it [09:24] i found that separation and anxiety is a [09:28] combination of environmental and [09:30] hereditary [09:32] factors [09:33] in other words [09:35] some lines of animals that i've dealt [09:37] with [09:39] have a big [09:41] issue with separation anxiety [09:43] others none whatsoever [09:45] i [09:46] honestly believe probably the hereditary [09:49] aspect of this [09:50] is more significant than the [09:52] environmental aspect of it [09:56] i think the more you socialize and work [09:59] with your dog and the more of a leader [10:01] you are for the dog [10:02] i would not worry about separation [10:05] anxiety and i would just let [10:08] the dog or puppy develop [10:10] as he will naturally [10:13] the question is when should you start [10:16] obedience training with your new puppy [10:18] should be between the 8 and 14 week [10:21] socialization period and the answer is [10:24] yes i think the earlier you start the [10:26] better however i begin with mostly [10:30] positive methods almost exclusively [10:33] i try to get the dog understanding the [10:36] special noise [10:38] being [10:39] in [10:40] enjoying the treats that i use [10:43] understanding various commands [10:46] i think there's an awful lot you can do [10:49] motivationally with young puppies as [10:52] you raise them and train them that makes [10:55] training easier as you progress [10:58] interesting byline is i've had puppies [11:02] that we have trained or come to classes [11:05] to school and gone through training at a [11:08] young age [11:09] that then the owners moved away [11:12] totally from the area [11:14] and brought the puppies back at six to [11:17] ten years of old age [11:20] and just for fun we decided we'd put [11:22] them through their routine and see what [11:24] they remembered from their early [11:25] training and in every case they most [11:29] definitely [11:30] remember all their early training even [11:32] though in many cases the owner has not [11:35] followed through [11:36] since the [11:37] having the puppy and [11:40] finishing the training as a puppy [11:42] so yes i think the earlier you begin [11:45] the better it is for your puppy [11:48] the question is at what stage do you [11:50] introduce a shaping box to perfect the [11:53] sitting down do you start right off with [11:56] it or do you let them get the basic [11:58] skill and then fix it later [12:01] i don't like to fix things later i like [12:03] to have the puppy [12:05] do everything correctly from the [12:07] beginning as much as possible the [12:10] shaping box is definitely a good way to [12:12] start [12:13] however [12:15] if i see that the puppy is developing a [12:18] problem [12:19] i [12:20] do whatever is necessary to try to [12:23] direct my training [12:25] towards [12:26] perfecting the behaviors exactly the way [12:29] i want [12:30] a good example [12:32] is a dog that tucks [12:34] our rocks into a sit [12:37] we want them to tuck into a sit not to [12:39] rock into a set and often with [12:42] the shaping box [12:44] they will learn to rock in which case i [12:47] remove them from the shaping box [12:49] and [12:50] continue with a more hands-on [12:53] technique [12:54] and training the dog to tuck rather than [12:57] to lock [12:58] rock into the sit [13:00] how do you or can you train a dog to [13:03] bark and command if the dog only barks [13:06] if he sees something like another person [13:09] or sees someone pull down the driveway [13:12] can you train a dog that is two years [13:15] old that was [13:16] bought to be a family dog to protect [13:20] with no experience from [13:23] the dog and owner that's a difficult [13:26] question again [13:28] if you want [13:29] your dog to be protective or to be a [13:31] guard dog [13:33] often times [13:35] it is [13:36] the nature or the hereditary aspect of [13:39] the dog as to whether or not the dog [13:41] sees this [13:43] stranger [13:44] as a threat and feels that it's [13:46] necessary to bark in them [13:48] as far as marking on command [13:52] that [13:53] usually can easily be taught by using [13:56] food or a ball [13:58] and just teasing the dog with it until [14:01] they can make a noise praising for it [14:03] and then continuing from there [14:06] as far as being a guard dog is concerned [14:09] i've seen a lot of dogs [14:11] that just [14:12] aren't going to be a guard dog they just [14:14] don't want to do that i've often i've [14:17] noticed that a little bit of fear in the [14:19] dog [14:20] is more likely to create them and [14:23] and shape them into becoming a guard dog [14:26] i recall a dog that i had a german [14:29] shepherd that showed no signs of being a [14:31] guard dog [14:32] he was a competition dog [14:35] he was very good with people very [14:37] friendly [14:38] and one night i was getting ready to go [14:41] skiing and we had some friends [14:43] driving in from illinois to ride out to [14:45] colorado with us that said they would [14:48] get there very late at night i said just [14:50] come on in the dog's loose in the house [14:52] but he knows you he won't bother you [14:55] i [14:57] was awakened about three in the morning [14:59] to a lot of barking and growling and [15:02] yelling [15:04] i got out of bed ran into the other room [15:07] to see what was going on and it was my [15:09] dog barking at these people had them [15:11] pinned in a corner [15:14] i thought that was very interesting [15:16] because the dog was aware [15:18] that people should not be entering the [15:20] premises in the middle of the night [15:22] however had they entered in the day like [15:24] everyone else that wouldn't have been a [15:26] problem [15:27] so [15:28] your dog may be like this it may be that [15:31] if he [15:32] perceives a situation as being [15:34] threatening [15:36] he will on his own bark as far as [15:38] telling the dog to bark and teaching him [15:40] to bark it people coming in [15:42] it can be done and i have seen it done [15:45] but i don't think it's very effective [15:47] and that the bark is not that [15:48] threatening [15:50] question not aggressive barking [15:53] at people and other dogs we pass on [15:56] walks [15:57] my corgi mix is a meet and greet kind of [16:00] dog [16:01] but if it gets [16:03] annoying [16:04] how can i stop this habit [16:06] i just simply teach them down [16:09] and put them in a down position [16:11] possibly a down stay [16:13] and talk to the stranger you meet if you [16:16] want to walk around a little bit [16:18] whatever but just don't allow the dog to [16:21] bark question is how do you stop a dog [16:24] from car chasing [16:26] i know i'm fighting instinct here [16:29] but there's got to be a way [16:31] she doesn't do it when on a leash only [16:35] went loose [16:36] in the fenced yard [16:38] i think ever since i became [16:40] a professional dog trainer i've [16:43] faced dealing with this [16:45] and fixing dogs with this [16:48] problem [16:49] obviously it's very dangerous to dog [16:51] it's very easy to run over a dog chasing [16:54] a car [16:55] even though the dog is behind the fence [16:57] what if he jumps the fence digs under it [16:59] and chases the car and gets hit [17:01] i've heard of this happening numerous [17:03] times [17:05] when i first started in training [17:08] i was told to put the dog on a long line [17:11] and time back to a [17:15] branch on a tree not to the tree but to [17:17] a branch [17:19] that would [17:20] provide [17:21] some degree of springiness [17:24] when he hit the end of the leaves so he [17:25] didn't get jerked [17:26] let him chase the car and when he hits [17:28] the end of the leash he gets pulled [17:30] backwards never did work [17:33] uh [17:34] i've [17:35] had [17:36] people [17:37] shoot guns trying to scare the dog away [17:39] from chasing the car [17:41] i've heard of people throwing [17:43] firecrackers all kinds of different ways [17:45] to do it [17:46] i guess it works sometimes or people [17:49] wouldn't talk about doing it that way [17:51] in my experience the only way to stop [17:53] this is by using a remote training [17:55] collar [17:56] which absolutely works [17:58] and [17:59] we do it several times a year [18:02] to fix people's dogs with this problem [18:05] and it absolutely works and in my [18:06] opinion it's far better than the [18:09] possibility of having my dog [18:11] accidentally get hit [18:12] question is what procedure [18:15] do you recommend for foreign nationals [18:17] when enrolling in our school [18:20] just fill out an application [18:22] send it to us and we will [18:25] develop an i-20 which is an immigration [18:28] form to come to the united states to [18:30] study in the states [18:32] we will complete that send that to you [18:35] take it to your embassy [18:37] obtain your visa [18:38] and then [18:40] buy your ticket and fly over to st louis [18:43] and come to school [18:45] the question is my [18:47] six-month german shepherd is learning [18:48] the track she loves it [18:50] i use back chaining from the articles to [18:53] start rather than food in each footsteps [18:55] we are just starting corners [18:58] but she is beginning to overrun the [19:00] articles on the track i do not stop [19:03] her or correct her how can i slow her [19:06] down [19:07] i think the best way to do this is make [19:09] frequent turns [19:11] uh make a stair step design [19:14] whatever you can the more turns you have [19:17] the better [19:20] this gets very involved the concept of [19:24] teaching a dog a track involves so many [19:26] different [19:28] stages so many different learning [19:30] techniques [19:32] i think if you buy my book and read the [19:35] chapter on tracking [19:36] that is the best way [19:38] to learn how to track outside of coming [19:40] to school [19:42] but this is a mini faceted thing i would [19:44] suggest that you get with a trainer in [19:47] your area that's familiar with tracking [19:49] and have them work with you [19:51] question simply what about the remote [19:53] training color [19:55] i think it's a very effective device [19:58] i think i was one of the first people in [20:00] the country to ever use one [20:02] in the old days it was very difficult to [20:04] use because it only had one setting [20:07] which is as high as you could go [20:10] very similar to a shock stick [20:12] very difficult to use [20:14] could not use it for obedience training [20:16] without scaring the dog [20:18] as far as the present day collars they [20:21] can be set very low [20:23] and i think by using a very minimal [20:26] amount of shock [20:27] that you can train a dog [20:30] much more humanely and effectively [20:33] than you would by using a pinch choke or [20:36] some other type of color as far as [20:38] making corrections are concerned i think [20:41] the shock collar or the we call it the [20:43] remote trainer is the best way to go in [20:46] many cases [20:48] it's a matter of does the trainer feel [20:52] confident and feel that it is okay to [20:55] use this type of training device [20:58] and if they are then it can be used [21:01] effectively however it can be used [21:04] incorrectly very easily and oftentimes [21:06] people do [21:08] i think if you want to use a remote [21:10] training collar get the help from a [21:12] professional trainer [21:13] come to class have someone show you how [21:15] to properly use it [21:17] because improperly [21:19] use could lead to doing severe damage to [21:23] your dog's [21:24] psyche or mentality [21:27] question is how can i make my puppy eat [21:29] her kibble without milk [21:31] i guess don't put milk in the kibble [21:34] she gets hungry enough she's gonna eat [21:36] i always keep these people that have [21:38] trouble getting their dogs to eat that [21:40] if i got hungry enough i hate broccoli [21:43] but if that's all i had to eat i'd eat [21:45] it [21:45] and i think in the case of your puppy [21:48] if you just quit putting milk in the [21:50] kibble if that's what you want to do i [21:52] don't know what's wrong with it but if [21:53] that's what you want to do is get her to [21:55] eat without the kibble uh with milk i [21:59] think you'll find that she'll eat the [22:01] kibble just fine [22:02] how can i train my dog not to run around [22:05] when i take off a leash and stay near me [22:08] simply have two leashes on the dog take [22:10] one off and see what happens [22:12] or use a remote training collar when you [22:14] take the leash off [22:17] but as long as the dog is staying near [22:20] you [22:20] and not getting into trouble when you [22:22] take off the leash i don't know that it [22:24] would be that much of a problem [22:26] i trained the britney spaniar one time [22:28] as it turned out to be an excellent show [22:30] dog [22:32] and prior to training i would take her [22:34] out on the field and turn her loose and [22:36] she'd run around and use circles [22:38] i just kind of let her run it off [22:41] and once she did i put the leash on [22:44] collar and we would begin our training [22:47] go to the dog show whatever we were [22:48] doing [22:50] and then oftentimes when i would take [22:52] the leash off [22:53] after we had [22:55] say shown in an akc ring [22:57] i'd take her outside take the leash off [22:59] and let her go and she'd run around did [23:01] the same thing again [23:02] come back to me and we'd continue on our [23:04] way [23:05] never had a problem when they we were in [23:07] the ring however [23:09] taking the leash off because she [23:11] understood that [23:12] she was still under command [23:14] so i think [23:15] enforcing your commands [23:18] working with your dog maybe putting a [23:20] short tab on the collar so when you [23:22] remove the leash you have a tab or [23:24] something you can get if you need to [23:25] make a correction when you remove the [23:28] leash don't remove the training collar [23:30] or maybe use a remote training collar a [23:33] lot of ways to do it are when you take [23:35] the leash off put the dog in it down [23:38] thanks again for watching today's [23:40] episode if you want to get a copy of [23:41] tom's book or if you're interested in a [23:44] school all the information will be

insurance in fact just like [00:14] last week one of my dogs needed some [00:16] medical attention and the bill was over [00:18] fourteen hundred dollars after [00:20] submitting the claim to prudent pet it [00:22] was processed and settled in no time i [00:25] wanted to say that i'm incredibly happy [00:26] with their services and i know you will [00:29] be too their pet insurance plans cover a [00:31] variety of needs for your pet with [00:33] plenty of customizable options plus if [00:36] you sign up through the link in the [00:37] description you'll get five percent off [00:41] today we'll be discussing the three [00:43] primary principles to dog training which [00:45] is timing motivation and consistency [00:49] first we're going to start with timing [00:52] it's been scientifically proven that we [00:54] have approximately one second to [00:56] influence a dog's behavior so this means [00:58] that you have one second to reward a dog [01:01] for a behavior you would like repeated [01:03] and one second to correct your dog for [01:05] behavior you would not like repeated if [01:08] the reward [01:09] or the correction does not come within [01:11] one second then your dog will not make [01:14] the connection [01:15] as soon as your dog makes a movement [01:17] that indicates the behavior you want to [01:18] capture you have to either deliver the [01:20] primary reinforcer or the condition [01:24] reinforcer within that first second the [01:27] same principle applies to actions you [01:28] would not like your dog to repeat the [01:30] moment your dog does the behavior in [01:32] question you have to deliver either the [01:34] primary correction or the condition [01:36] correction within a second of your dog [01:39] doing that behavior [01:40] here's an example of how important [01:42] timing is so [01:44] let's say you're doing a down stay with [01:45] your dog and you're in a wide open space [01:47] such as a football field a fenced in one [01:50] and while you're walking away from your [01:52] dog across the field your dog breaks the [01:54] down stay without you seeing and then [01:56] your dog decides to run to you and when [01:58] you turn around and see your dog running [02:00] at you you correct your dog for breaking [02:02] the down stay [02:04] even though you believe that you [02:05] corrected your dog for breaking the down [02:07] state you actually just corrected your [02:10] dog for coming to you [02:12] since you didn't see your dog break the [02:14] down stay [02:15] within the first second you shouldn't [02:17] have corrected your dog instead you [02:19] could have ignored the behavior reset [02:21] and tried again or you could have done [02:23] what i would do which is reward the dog [02:25] for coming to me [02:26] then reset and try again because we want [02:29] our dogs to always know that it's good [02:31] if they come to us the next principle is [02:34] motivation your dog will always do [02:36] whatever is most motivating for example [02:39] if you're trying to get your dog to [02:40] perform a sit and his favorite thing [02:42] surrounds him let's say rabbits and he's [02:45] going to be or he's going to be more [02:46] motivated to chase the rabbits compared [02:48] to his motivation to work for your treat [02:51] it's essential to keep in mind that dogs [02:53] can be motivated by many things they can [02:56] be motivated to access something [02:57] pleasant they can be motivated to access [03:00] or prevent something unpleasant or the [03:02] behavior itself is fun [03:04] by ensuring that you always provide the [03:06] most motivating factor for your dog [03:09] you'll ensure reliability within your [03:11] dog's obedience [03:13] now there are four ways you can motivate [03:15] a dog to perform a behavior you have [03:17] food toys affection or force and it's [03:20] important to learn how to use all four [03:22] types of motivation within your training [03:24] if you want reliability another factor [03:26] to consider is the speed is based on [03:29] motivation so the more motivated your [03:31] dog is the faster your dog will perform [03:32] the desired behavior [03:34] and aside from the motivating factors [03:36] the next important element is your dog's [03:38] level of perseverance [03:40] something that throws many people off is [03:43] when a dog has low perseverance and [03:46] gives up when something seems too [03:48] challenging for example you're trying to [03:50] get your dog to do a spin it's a common [03:52] command that i like to use [03:54] for treat and he stops halfway through [03:56] this dog has a lower level of [03:58] perseverance he gives up where other [04:00] dogs might do the entire circle to get [04:01] the reward in these situations you have [04:03] to adjust with a dog's level of [04:04] perseverance if they give up easily you [04:07] want to reward the dog midway through [04:09] the completion of their behavior until [04:10] they learn to do it the entire way [04:13] they build success with more success so [04:15] some dogs however will have a higher [04:17] perseverance and require less [04:19] adjustments as such that type of dog is [04:22] easier to train like my dog ari [04:24] principle 3 consistency or what i would [04:26] like to say cause and effect [04:29] this one is paramount because even if [04:30] you have bad timing or wrong motivation [04:33] your dog will still learn if you are [04:36] consistent this involves always being [04:38] consistent with what you want and expect [04:40] from your dog if you let your dog jump [04:42] up on the furniture one day don't [04:43] correct your dog for jumping up on the [04:45] furniture the next day if you are [04:47] inconsistent you can create stress and [04:49] confusion for the dog you're training [04:51] you also want to be consistent with the [04:52] way you say your markers or the [04:54] conditioned reinforcers as well as your [04:56] commands remember your dog doesn't [04:58] understand the word sit instead your dog [05:01] hears a sound so you want your commands [05:04] to always sound the same meaning you [05:06] shouldn't constantly be changing the [05:08] rise and inflection of your commands sit [05:10] should always be sit [05:12] on the other topic let's discuss [05:14] predictability this word is not part of [05:16] the primary principles but you must [05:18] always keep it in mind for dog training [05:20] always think about your actions as you [05:22] train your dog and if they are becoming [05:24] predictable or not [05:25] you can use this to improve the training [05:28] process or by contrast it can create [05:31] problems for example let's say you love [05:33] taking your dog to the beach and this is [05:35] an activity that your dog also enjoys [05:37] and your dog runs around and plays and [05:39] every time you're ready to leave that's [05:40] when you call your dog to you eventually [05:42] your dog will learn not to come to you [05:44] when you call because you've created a [05:46] predictable pattern that calling equals [05:48] leaving the beach which your dog doesn't [05:50] want [05:51] instead you would always want to play [05:53] come when call games this is something [05:55] that i like to do at the beach that [05:56] would predict release and reward like [05:58] maybe with a ball or toy this way your [06:01] dog will enjoy coming to you when called [06:03] it's a simple concept if your dog can [06:05] predict something then your dog can [06:06] learn it just like obedience you say the [06:08] command then you show the dog the [06:10] physical cue this way the dog learns [06:12] that when you say command it is followed [06:14] by the action that gets the dog into the [06:17] position once the dog knows this you no [06:19] longer need the physical cue because it [06:22] is now predictable for your dog [06:24] and on the topic of consistency there's [06:26] a mistake that some owners like to make [06:28] which i would like to mention which is [06:30] playing tricks with their dog and this [06:32] can destroy the trusting relationship [06:34] for example um a lot of owners like to [06:37] play fetch and they may pretend to throw [06:38] the ball but they really didn't and then [06:41] everyone gets a laugh when the dog goes [06:42] chasing after nothing while this could [06:44] be a funny thing to do it could actually [06:46] have a negative impact on your training [06:48] process especially if you're trying to [06:50] become a professional dog trainer [06:52] there are many more examples such as [06:54] getting a dog excited about thinking [06:56] that it's feeding time and not feeding [06:58] them or other practical jokes played on [07:00] the dog [07:01] a dog may not understand the humor or [07:04] the jokes that are intended and could [07:06] lose trust in the owner an owner who [07:08] frequently plays tricks will discover a [07:10] dog that stops carrying or taking [07:13] anything serious that the owner wants to [07:15] teach [07:17] so today we've covered the three primary [07:20] principles of dog training what they are [07:22] and how we can use them within our [07:24] training remember timing motivation and [07:27] consistency [07:28] i want to mention if you guys like the [07:30] shirt that i'm wearing or any of the [07:32] other shirts that i've worn on my show [07:34] and you want to support the channel you [07:35] can pick one up at [07:37] nateshomershop.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 268/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back everyone to another episode [00:02] in today's video we'll be discussing the [00:04] basics of dog psychology the foundation [00:07] and understanding of dog psychology [00:09] starts with the four quadrants of opera [00:11] conditioning now upper conditioning [00:14] basically means a subject that [00:16] understands that their behavior has an [00:17] effect on their environment meaning they [00:19] can make good or bad things happen to [00:21] them and these four quadrants greatly [00:24] help us facilitate that since this is [00:26] something that most people have a hard [00:28] time understanding i thought it would be [00:30] worthwhile to have a video dedicated to [00:32] this subject [00:33] the four are positive reinforcement [00:36] positive punishment negative [00:37] reinforcement and negative punishment [00:40] these can be broken down into two [00:42] factors [00:43] reinforcement which means to encourage a [00:45] behavior to be repeated whereas [00:48] punishment means to discourage a [00:50] behavior from being repeated [00:52] positive means to add something to the [00:54] equation to influence behavior while [00:56] negative means to remove something to [00:59] influence behavior now i understand that [01:01] it can be tricky to see positive as [01:04] discouraging of behavior as in positive [01:06] punishment and negative as encouraging a [01:09] behavior as a negative reinforcement but [01:12] it's easy to understand the context of [01:14] opera conditioning where positive and [01:16] negative are not used to mean the same [01:19] things we would normally use them for [01:21] such as good and bad [01:25] keep in mind that a dog's personal [01:27] interest and motivating factors can [01:30] change the way that a dog looks at a [01:32] correction or reward for example one dog [01:35] may like being sprayed with a water hose [01:38] and another may not like it the one that [01:40] likes the water hose would see it as a [01:42] reward positive reinforcement and the [01:45] one that doesn't like it would see it as [01:47] a punishment positive punishment this is [01:50] why we need to understand what drives [01:52] and motivates each dog that we're [01:54] training and this is also why many [01:56] techniques won't work on every single [01:59] dog [02:00] we're going to start with positive [02:02] reinforcement and how it is applied to [02:04] dog training as explained earlier [02:06] positive in this context means to add to [02:09] the equation and reinforcement means to [02:12] encourage a behavior to be repeated [02:14] therefore positive reinforcement [02:16] translates to giving your dog anything [02:18] your dog sees as valuable with the goal [02:22] of encouraging the repeat of a behavior [02:25] now many of us do this intentionally [02:27] while training using treats and toys and [02:30] petting but we also do this outside of [02:32] training and sometimes without even [02:34] realizing it we're going to go over a [02:36] few examples of positive reinforcement [02:38] and dog training including both helpful [02:40] and unhelpful situations where an owner [02:42] may unknowingly reinforce bad behaviors [02:46] one giving your dog a treat for doing a [02:48] command such as a sit or down pretty [02:50] simple reinforcing the sit and the down [02:54] two throw in a ball for your dog to [02:56] fetch after your dog barked at you in [02:58] this situation the toy would reinforce [03:00] the bark [03:01] three petting your dog after your dog [03:03] nudges your hand for attention the [03:05] petting is reinforcing the nudge [03:07] four your dog pulls on the leash and you [03:09] walk in the direction your dog is [03:11] pulling walking forward is giving your [03:13] dog more freedom and control which would [03:15] be reinforcing the pulling and then [03:17] people wonder why their dogs keep [03:18] pulling on the leash [03:20] five your dog barks at someone and you [03:23] reassure your dog by petting them it's [03:25] okay [03:27] even though [03:29] in this situation you think you're [03:30] reinforcing the dog and making sure [03:32] they're okay but you're actually [03:34] reinforcing the barking [03:36] six your dog jumps up on someone and [03:38] they pet your dog the petting would be [03:40] reinforcing the jumping now it's also [03:42] important to keep in mind that positive [03:44] reinforcement doesn't have to be [03:46] something physical [03:48] telling your dog good boy or good girl [03:50] would also be a form of positive [03:52] reinforcement now let's go over negative [03:55] reinforcement negative reinforcement is [03:57] when pressure is turned on to get the [03:59] desired behavior and once the behavior [04:01] is completed the pressure is turned off [04:04] in order for negative reinforcement to [04:06] work two things must take place [04:08] one once the pressure is turned on it [04:10] cannot be turned off until the dog [04:13] complies and two the moment the dog [04:16] complies the pressure must instantly be [04:18] turned off we're going to go over a few [04:20] examples of negative reinforcement in [04:22] dog training [04:23] let's say you're trying to get your dog [04:25] to sit and your dog is standing refusing [04:27] to sit so you start to push on your [04:29] dog's rear end until your dog sits [04:31] once your dog sits you remove your hand [04:34] your dog will now know that every time [04:37] he doesn't want your hand to push on his [04:38] rear he can sit to remove that pressure [04:42] so why is this negative reinforcement [04:44] well the pressure from your hand was [04:46] present before your dog decided to sit [04:49] the dog's behavior of sitting is [04:51] removing the pressure from your hand [04:54] therefore negative reinforcement is [04:56] occurring [04:57] for a better understanding let's break [04:59] each example of negative reinforcement [05:01] into four parts before [05:03] the behavior [05:05] after [05:06] and future behavior so before [05:09] pressure is being placed on the dog's [05:11] rear end [05:12] behavior the dog goes into the sit [05:15] position [05:16] after the pressure from your hand is [05:19] released [05:20] future behavior the dog will sit when [05:23] the slightest pressure is placed on his [05:25] rear [05:26] second example [05:28] getting your dog into the down position [05:30] with your hand [05:31] your dog is standing and refusing to lay [05:34] down so you start to push on your dog's [05:36] shoulder blades until your dog complies [05:38] and lays down [05:39] once your dog lays down the pressure [05:41] from your hand is removed [05:44] now your dog knows that every time he [05:46] doesn't want your hand to push on his [05:48] shoulder blades he can lay down to [05:51] remove that pressure [05:53] again so why is this negative [05:54] reinforcement [05:56] the pressure from your hand was present [05:57] before your dog decided to lay down [06:00] his behavior of going into the down [06:02] position is removing the pressure from [06:04] your hand therefore negative [06:06] reinforcement is occurring [06:08] okay let's remember those four parts [06:11] before the behavior after and future [06:14] behavior before pressure is being [06:16] applied on your dog's shoulder blades [06:18] the behavior the dog goes into the down [06:21] position or the desired position after [06:23] the pressure from your hand is released [06:26] future behavior the dog will lay down [06:28] when the slightest pressure is placed on [06:31] his shoulder blades [06:32] next one is getting your dog to sit with [06:35] leash pressure this is a common [06:37] technique that i use and recommend [06:40] your dog is standing and refusing to sit [06:42] so you start to pull up on the leash [06:43] until your dog sits once your dog sits [06:46] the pressure from the leash is instantly [06:48] removed and your dog now knows that [06:50] every time he doesn't want to feel that [06:52] pressure from the leash he can sit to [06:54] remove that pressure [06:56] so why is this negative reinforcement [06:58] well the pressure from the leash was [07:00] present before your dog decides to sit [07:02] the behavior of sitting is removing the [07:05] pressure from the leash therefore [07:07] negative reinforcement is occurring [07:11] before pressure is being placed on the [07:13] dog's neck from the leash the behavior [07:16] the dog goes into the sit position [07:18] after the pressure from the leash is [07:20] released [07:22] and four [07:23] future behavior the dog will sit when [07:25] the slightest pressure is applied by [07:27] lifting up on the leash next one is [07:30] getting your dog into the down with the [07:32] leash pressure your dog is standing and [07:34] refusing to lay down so you start to [07:37] pull down on the leash until your dog [07:38] decides to lay down once your dog lays [07:41] down the pressure from the leash is [07:43] instantly removed your dog now knows [07:46] that every time he doesn't want to feel [07:47] the pressure from the leash he can lay [07:49] down to remove that pressure [07:52] again so why is this negative [07:53] reinforcement well the pressure from the [07:56] leash was present before your dog [07:58] decides to lay down his behavior of [08:00] laying down is removing the pressure [08:02] from the leash therefore negative [08:04] reinforcement is occurring [08:08] before [08:09] pressure is applied downward on the [08:11] dog's neck from the leash the behavior [08:14] the dog goes into the down position [08:17] after the pressure from the leash is [08:19] released and future behavior the dog [08:22] will lay down with the slightest [08:24] pressure being applied [08:26] downward on the leash [08:28] next one we're going to go over is [08:30] positive punishment [08:33] positive punishment is when something is [08:35] added to the equation that the dog [08:38] doesn't like to reduce the likelihood of [08:40] the behavior being repeated [08:43] let's go over a few examples of positive [08:44] punishment now keep in mind that there [08:46] are many ways to use positive punishment [08:49] to discourage a behavior [08:52] not all of these punishments are [08:53] necessarily good ways but they are [08:56] examples of the concepts of positive [08:59] punishment and the types of actions dog [09:01] owners may knowingly or unknowingly [09:04] perform so first one yelling at a dog [09:06] for a bad behavior this is one i don't [09:08] recommend unless you want your dog to be [09:10] afraid of you [09:12] two popping the leash on a training [09:14] collar when your dog does an undesired [09:16] behavior three correcting a dog with a [09:18] remote training collar when the dog is [09:20] doing an undesired behavior [09:22] for me and the dog in the chest when the [09:25] dog jumps up at you again this is a [09:27] technique i would not recommend since [09:29] it's not only less effective than other [09:31] techniques but it's also dangerous [09:33] five honking a loud horn at the dog to [09:36] stop an undesired behavior and six [09:38] sprain two dogs with a water hose to [09:41] stop a dog fight now there are plenty [09:43] more examples that we can go over but i [09:45] think this is enough to understand the [09:46] concept of positive punishment adding to [09:49] the equation to stop a bad behavior [09:51] next is understanding negative [09:53] punishment this is when something is [09:55] removed from the equation that the dog [09:57] likes in order to decrease in undesired [10:00] or bad behavior negative punishment [10:02] techniques are commonly practiced in dog [10:04] training especially for pure positive [10:06] dog trainers since they don't use [10:08] positive punishment we're going to go [10:10] over a few examples of negative [10:11] punishment once again not all of these [10:13] punishments are necessarily good ways to [10:15] discourage a behavior but they are [10:17] examples of the concept of negative [10:19] punishment [10:20] one while you're petting your dog he [10:22] decides to jump up at you and as a [10:23] result you stop petting your dog and you [10:26] ignore him by removing the petting you [10:28] would be implementing negative [10:30] punishment [10:31] two your dog barks at you to get your [10:34] attention so you put your dog in the [10:35] crate taking away their freedom not a [10:37] recommended technique but again an [10:39] example of negative punishment [10:41] your dog wants a treat so you tell him [10:43] to sit he decides not to sit so he [10:45] doesn't receive the reward [10:47] your dog starts to resource guard the [10:49] couch so you stop letting him on the [10:51] couch if something the dog likes is [10:53] taken away from them to stop a bad [10:55] behavior you would be implementing [10:57] negative punishment [10:59] now we have a basic understanding of the [11:01] four quadrants of opera conditioning i [11:04] really hope this video has given you a [11:05] better understanding of the four [11:06] quadrants of opera conditioning and how [11:09] you can use them within your dog [11:10] training [11:12] thanks again for watching today's video [11:14] if you want to support the channel you [11:16] can by liking and

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 271/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] is it wrong to correct your dog for bad [00:02] behaviors [00:03] is there such thing as reliable pure [00:06] positive dog training [00:07] questions like these are often asked in [00:10] the dog training world as well as the [00:12] internet and many people argue that a [00:14] dog should never be corrected while [00:16] others will correct a dog for what would [00:17] appear to be no reason at all [00:20] both may seem extreme what we mean to [00:22] find is a balance this balance of [00:24] properly timed rewards and corrections [00:27] which will help us facilitate opera [00:29] conditioning in today's video we'll be [00:31] discussing the four different types of [00:33] training pure positive pressure based or [00:35] escape training avoidance training and [00:38] balance training [00:40] let's start with reward based training [00:42] this is an ideal training style to start [00:45] your dog on but it can also take the [00:47] longest simply put this is when you use [00:49] rewards and praise to teach all the [00:52] desired behaviors and you use negative [00:54] punishment when your dog fails to [00:56] perform the correct action so they learn [00:58] to go into different positions to access [01:00] rewards now this training is almost [01:04] entirely stress-free for a dog which [01:06] makes the training very positive for [01:08] them the training uses a combination of [01:10] positive reinforcement and negative [01:12] punishment even though it uses negative [01:14] punishment it's still known as pure [01:17] positive since the trainers do not use [01:20] positive punishment which is usually a [01:22] physical correction however even if you [01:25] never corrected a dog with a physical [01:26] correction you would be implementing [01:28] positive punishment if you were to yell [01:30] at your dog [01:31] let's go over the three common ways we [01:33] can use reward based training the first [01:36] one and the most common is luring [01:41] this is when you use food to guide your [01:43] dog into the desired position and once [01:46] your dog is in that position you would [01:47] release the reward to your dog if you're [01:50] using markers you would mark and then [01:52] reward [01:53] next is fix shaping this is when you [01:55] have a training goal in mind but you're [01:56] letting your dog figure out what you [01:58] want instead of directly showing them [02:00] you can see an example of this in my [02:02] scent detection series with my dog ari [02:05] that actively figures out what i want [02:07] without me having to tell her [02:09] last is free shaping this is when you [02:11] don't have a particular training goal in [02:12] mind but you mark and reward behaviors [02:15] that your dog performs that you like [02:17] for example your dog goes and lays down [02:19] on their bed you like that behavior so [02:21] you mark and reward that action or your [02:23] dog sits you mark and reward that since [02:26] your dog's actions made the reward [02:28] appear your dog will start to learn that [02:30] they can make rewards happen based on [02:32] their behaviors which helps create [02:34] what's known as an active or proactive [02:37] dog this also helps teach our dogs that [02:39] they can get rewards even if they don't [02:41] actively see the reward in our hands [02:44] sounds simple which it is and it's [02:46] incredibly effective i highly recommend [02:48] you do this with any dog that you're [02:50] training [02:51] next is pressure-based training also [02:53] known as escape training since a dog is [02:56] learning to escape the pressure by [02:58] complying this type of training is [03:00] usually accomplished with a leash it is [03:02] often referred to as leash pressure [03:04] training however when done correctly [03:07] this training actually becomes a leash [03:09] cube since a dog trained on leash [03:11] pressure understands that they need to [03:13] follow the leash instead of resisting it [03:16] it helps cue them into different [03:17] behaviors and it's one more tool we can [03:20] use to effectively and clearly [03:22] communicate with our dogs [03:24] using leash pressure is excellent if you [03:26] want faster results and it uses a [03:28] combination of negative reinforcement [03:31] negative punishment and positive [03:33] reinforcement you turn the pressure on [03:35] and when your dog complies you [03:37] immediately turn the pressure off and [03:38] reward your dog [03:40] i don't prefer to start this way but i [03:43] do like to use this technique once the [03:45] dog understands the concept of luring [03:48] since we can use the food lure to teach [03:50] the dog leash pressure and once the dog [03:53] understands this concept we can then use [03:55] this in training to help with [03:56] reliability the stay command and how to [03:59] turn off pressure which will increase [04:01] your dog's confidence [04:03] there are a few things to know before [04:04] jumping into this style of training [04:06] one of the first things to consider is [04:08] when you use a leash you'll quickly [04:10] discover that your dog is resisting it [04:12] that's because dogs possess what's known [04:14] as a classical opposition reflex if you [04:17] pull on a leash they resist and go the [04:19] opposite direction [04:21] however [04:22] with leash pressure our aim is to teach [04:25] them to go with the direction of the [04:28] leash or with the pressure of the leash [04:30] which opens up new training [04:32] opportunities [04:33] once the dog understands to go in the [04:35] direction of the leash we can use it to [04:37] teach positions such as sit down stand [04:41] direction into the heel position walking [04:43] forward walking backwards or any other [04:46] number of behaviors we also use leash [04:48] pressure to easily teach our dogs the [04:50] stay command leash pressure also helps [04:52] to teach a dog what behaviors are not [04:54] acceptable without having to issue a [04:56] correction for example clearly teaching [04:58] a dog barrier such as not entering the [05:00] bathroom or the kitchen not walking out [05:03] the front door or into the street we can [05:05] also use this to stop specific [05:07] behavioral issues such as jumping up on [05:09] furniture or playing too rough with [05:11] another dog [05:12] remember positive reinforcement is [05:14] limited by how much the dog wants the [05:16] reward but negative reinforcement means [05:19] the dog is given no choice but to comply [05:22] and learn next is avoidance training [05:26] this style of training the trainer would [05:28] correct the dog into each desired [05:30] position this is considered an older [05:33] style of training and it's not as [05:35] commonly used anymore and even though [05:37] the dog learns very quickly it can [05:39] create a bad association to the training [05:42] this training uses a combination of [05:44] positive punishment negative punishment [05:47] and positive reinforcement [05:49] for example the dog would be given the [05:50] command sit then the dog would be [05:52] corrected into the position with an [05:54] upward leash pop while simultaneously [05:56] pushing down on the dog's butt because [05:58] the dog was given the correction they'll [06:01] start to automatically sit because they [06:03] don't want to experience another [06:05] correction in other words you're [06:07] correcting a dog without the dog [06:09] actually doing something wrong again [06:12] this type of training is very [06:13] old-fashioned and likely not a good idea [06:15] anymore [06:16] the last is balanced dog training this [06:20] is the most preferred style of training [06:22] and it's becoming more and more popular [06:24] as this information spreads it's what i [06:26] recommend the balance trainer uses all [06:29] four quadrants of opera conditioning [06:31] positive reinforcement negative [06:33] reinforcement positive punishment and [06:35] negative punishment [06:36] first starting with positive [06:38] reinforcement to teach the dog what [06:40] behaviors are desirable [06:42] second using negative punishment to [06:44] avoid rewarding undesired behaviors [06:47] third implementing negative [06:48] reinforcement with leash pressure to [06:50] teach a dog what behaviors are not [06:52] acceptable without having to issue a [06:53] correction and finally using positive [06:56] punishment to develop reliability [06:58] remember we must always keep in mind [07:00] that everything our dogs do is based on [07:02] motivation the motivation to access [07:04] something pleasant or the motivation to [07:06] prevent something unpleasant and if we [07:08] can always present the most motivating [07:10] factor whether it be a reward or [07:12] correction we will guarantee reliability [07:14] and that reliability might one day save [07:17] a dog's life [07:24] if you want to support the channel you [07:25] can by liking

is basically a [00:41] consultation i want to see what his [00:44] problem is exactly where are his dogs in [00:46] the training process and try to figure [00:48] out what his goals are what does brian [00:50] want his dogs to do does he want to sit [00:52] to down to come to heal to go to their [00:54] place to stay there to do bad flips [00:57] whatever it is i'm gonna glean that [00:58] information from him and then what we're [01:00] gonna do is we're gonna come up with an [01:02] awesome training plan and move forward [01:03] i'd also like to see a little bit of a [01:05] demonstration from him i want him to [01:07] show me what his dogs can do so [01:09] basically i'm gonna see if he can give [01:11] his dogs a couple commands [01:13] and see if they can listen to him do [01:14] those couple of commands hey guys thanks [01:17] for joining us again i'm nate shomer [01:19] here with the amazing incredible actor [01:22] comedian podcast host athlete all-around [01:26] athlete all around athletes give her to [01:28] all mankind very very humble humble uh [01:31] dog lover dog lover dog lover who runs [01:34] with dogs and sometimes wolves runs with [01:36] dogs and sometimes wolves right and [01:38] you're here to help me [01:40] you know basically train these animals [01:42] that that have zero training i wouldn't [01:44] say control see what i mean by humble he [01:46] says zero training but they still kind [01:48] of follow you that's because i have a [01:50] natural sort of charismatic magnetic [01:52] energy they kind of sit yeah right [01:54] animals are drawn to me my essence wild [01:56] horses wolves uh dogs [01:59] well you marines you have that very [02:01] positive outgoing energy and dogs tend [02:04] to gravitate towards that so i like [02:05] thinking of a sexual but okay i mean [02:07] that you whatever floats your boat right [02:09] i mean [02:10] but the main thing here is you do have [02:12] really nice dogs and we're going to take [02:13] them and we're going to teach them to do [02:15] everything that you've been struggling [02:16] with yeah organizing can they not pull [02:19] on me [02:20] i [02:23] like i'm literally i'm mushing my dogs i [02:26] don't know where they think they're [02:27] going but they're just like let's go do [02:29] they do they do that yeah it drives me [02:31] crazy i'm like how can you be that dumb [02:32] you're choking yourself can you guys get [02:34] like i want them some of the things that [02:36] brian told me in our conversation was [02:38] he has two awesome dogs but they have a [02:41] couple basic problems that a lot of [02:42] people run into so one big one is they [02:45] pull on the leash right you see people [02:46] walking down the street all the time and [02:48] their dogs gone [02:50] as they're leading the way right that's [02:52] not only a problem because it's [02:53] uncomfortable as they're walking but it [02:55] also could be potentially harmful to the [02:57] dog after years of doing that we want to [02:59] fix that i want them at my knees is that [03:02] possible that's absolutely possible the [03:03] cool thing about heal a lot of people [03:04] think heal means walk with me yeah heal [03:06] me is a position okay it's this position [03:08] next to you so when you walk in order [03:10] for the dog to maintain heal yeah so [03:12] happens they have to walk with you right [03:14] so that's what we teach them we're [03:15] teaching them simply a position okay can [03:17] we get them to come when i call them we [03:19] can get them to come what else [03:20] that's it just come come here just come [03:23] come here [03:24] that's a good girl yes [03:26] sort of well she came to me that's a [03:28] very rare occurrence [03:30] but anyway yeah i want them to come and [03:32] mainly like the she'll she'll listen to [03:34] me sometimes but if there's any [03:35] distraction i got no control over these [03:38] dogs okay and that's the biggest thing [03:40] if there's a dog over there i'm losing [03:42] them if there's somebody pushing a cart [03:44] over there i'm losing them so i want a [03:46] dog that's going to come to me when i [03:47] call him i want a dog that's going to [03:49] heal at my knee when i'm walking i'm not [03:51] pulling me like i'm in the iditarod i [03:52] want a dog that's going to down i want a [03:54] dog that's going to stay [03:56] i want a dog like when i have company [03:58] or i i'm going to answer the door [04:00] i don't want them all over my guests [04:02] jumping up on them yeah jumping up on [04:04] there so i don't know you want to sit [04:05] too i'm assuming i want to sit too and [04:07] then the one that i think is going to [04:09] help with what you just mentioned as far [04:10] as people come to the door or you have [04:12] guests you don't want to have to put [04:13] them in the crate every single time [04:14] exactly so what we do is we teach them [04:16] what i like to call a client command a [04:17] climb command client and climb that and [04:19] i'm going to do a shout out real quick [04:20] okay go ahead tom rose school right [04:22] that's the place that taught me how to [04:24] be professional dog trainer and they're [04:25] the ones that really established that [04:26] climb command okay so you almost know a [04:28] trainer if they say climb that they came [04:30] from tom rose a lot of other people will [04:31] say place [04:33] but you call it what you want tom rose [04:35] over here guys tom rose is pretty [04:36] awesome [04:38] so what the climb command is though is [04:40] basically it's anything elevated it's [04:42] not climbing up on you right because i [04:43] don't think you'd want the dogs jumping [04:44] up on you maybe on my back but it's [04:47] it's climbing up on anything that's [04:48] elevated okay so you can use it climb up [04:50] on this well you don't want them to jump [04:52] on on the fire pit but you get the point [04:54] climb on the porch climb on a chair [04:56] climb on a rock climb in your truck yeah [04:58] or your car whatever it is you cruise [04:59] around it i drive a tesla driver on a [05:01] test car tesla's amazing hashtag [05:03] successful [05:05] wealthy [05:07] it's a nice car i saw you alienate [05:09] you're racing that too don't you yeah [05:11] just like full throttle yeah yeah hit [05:14] like 60 70 sometimes i don't care i'm [05:16] crazy 67 i take my seat belt off but i'm [05:18] going like 40.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 275/841,[05:20] holy cow i know you like [05:24] now listen so so you're going to get [05:26] speaking of rules though we're going to [05:27] get these dogs squared away they're [05:29] going to do what i tell them basically [05:30] yeah i'm going to have dogs i'm going to [05:31] have controlled [05:33] see i want dogs i can control control [05:36] because for me a controlled dog from [05:38] what i've heard is a happy dog exactly [05:40] right and it's also happy what [05:42] not just dog [05:44] owner owner yes [05:46] happy owner [05:47] control dog is a happy owner exactly and [05:50] it's a happy dog too because now they [05:52] have a clear path to success yes they [05:54] know what they're supposed to do yeah [05:55] they know how to navigate within the [05:57] human world in ways that other dogs [05:58] don't and their life just becomes that [06:00] much better yeah so [06:02] we don't have to work on tug can we get [06:04] my dog to not chew my shoe we can do [06:06] that as well okay [06:07] that's not a problem [06:09] and not chewing growl or anything [06:11] so you showed me what they were able to [06:12] do in here what i think we should do is [06:14] we should throw the leashes on them go [06:16] out on the street and really see how [06:17] they behave with distractions let's do [06:19] it man perfect all right cool let's go [06:21] his dogs do kind of somewhat follow him [06:24] within the yard but i mean the second we [06:26] go out into a place where there's more [06:27] distractions they're all over the place [06:29] we want them to know just the basic [06:30] commands so they're not sitting for him [06:32] they're not downing for them and they're [06:34] definitely not staying they're kind of [06:35] in their own world and nico his new [06:38] puppy is doing a lot of basic puppy [06:40] behaviors he's chewing on things he's [06:42] chewing on his shoes he's barking and [06:44] snarling running around a couple [06:46] accidents inside the house so we're [06:47] going to fix those as well [06:50] hey [06:52] so she definitely wants to lead the way [06:53] and we're getting a little bit of [06:54] competition from both of them yeah so [06:57] yeah so one's trying to lead and then [06:58] the other one's trying to lean in front [06:59] of right so they go back and forth yeah [07:02] all right that's gonna be [07:03] and i deal with this all day will they [07:05] do anything lost leashes and they just [07:06] go wherever they want can you try to [07:08] tell them to sit see if they'll do [07:09] anything [07:10] hey okay listen both of you guys hey hey [07:12] sit [07:13] sit [07:15] yeah sit [07:16] sit hey [07:18] or down guys down [07:21] hey nico [07:23] nico come here mikko [07:25] mikko [07:27] nikko [07:29] man i really got some good command on my [07:30] dogs hey and this is what most people [07:32] struggle with i deal with this i don't [07:34] think it drives me crazy honestly and [07:36] honestly i'll be honest with you walking [07:38] my dog is not fun yeah it takes it makes [07:40] me more irritated by the time i done [07:41] with my dog walk i'm irritated could i [07:44] spend all day yelling at him going hey [07:46] and i i know that's the wrong thing to [07:47] do so i think what they're dealing with [07:48] is a schizophrenic they're like this [07:50] guy's telling me that i can play but [07:51] then [07:52] i don't know how to communicate with the [07:53] dog so perfect picture for you though is [07:54] the leash is nice and loose you have one [07:56] on each side and you're walking casually [07:58] and the only reason why the leash is [07:59] still on the dog is because it's [08:01] required by law that they're leashed [08:02] that that'd be pretty that's the only [08:04] reason why it's there besides that [08:05] they're walking with that would be [08:06] amazing so we're gonna show them these [08:08] things this is simple obedience but it [08:10] can be very difficult if you don't know [08:12] what to do and you don't know how to [08:13] communicate effectively so we're going [08:15] to take these dogs we're going to show [08:16] them what to do and we're going to get [08:17] you what you need all right because i'm [08:19] being pulled this is right yeah they're [08:21] and they're doing their own thing all [08:22] right keep pulling on me keep walking [08:24] that way that's it and keep walking [08:26] generally and we'll just walk generally [08:28] you pull on my my arm which then pulls [08:31] on my neck and my back it's awesome [08:33] perfect and now be distracted now be [08:36] distracted [08:41] literally this is what they do [08:43] and you think that the tension on their [08:45] neck would stop us [08:50] well we'll fix that too [08:57] right is that they keep they when they [08:59] see a dog [09:00] they go crazy he wants to say that [09:02] that's where awfully stuff i could never [09:04] get them to stop doing that [09:06] i'd like my dogs to stop barking at [09:08] other dogs because that's where i could [09:11] never have them off leash because the [09:12] minute they see a dog they go after it [09:13] as you just saw yeah he's this one's [09:15] pulling one way she's pulling the other [09:16] way it's chaos and they start barking [09:18] and gets nuts now [09:20] uh yeah so there it is big thing is what [09:22] do we want the picture to look like when [09:23] it's done right you want to be able to [09:25] walk with the dogs you're looking good [09:27] you're feeling good dogs are looking [09:29] good feeling good they're walking next [09:30] to you you stop boom they sit for you [09:33] you don't have to stay sick really they [09:35] do you say heel boom you guys are [09:36] walking now you're walking as one not [09:39] this chaos i like it man and it's gonna [09:42] look good it's gonna look real good i [09:43] like it [09:44] these guys are gonna have a lot of fun [09:46] at the sanctuary they're gonna do plenty [09:47] of sits plenty of downs they're going to [09:49] really understand loose leash walking [09:51] we're also going to do some really fun [09:52] swimming with them and we're going to [09:54] film a lot of this training so you'll be [09:55] able to see what they're going through [09:56] and at the end you'll get that product [09:58] you get that perfect dog that you're [09:59] looking for i'm excited man i'm pretty [10:02] excited distraction proof distraction [10:04] proof obedience all that good stuff hey [10:06] get out push push bush proof push proof [10:08] whatever works [10:10] brian calling ladies and gentlemen [10:15] after speaking with brian there's a few [10:16] things i'm going to start working on [10:17] with these dogs right away i'm going to [10:19] continue to build their confidence [10:20] they're already super confident dogs but [10:22] we want to get them to be socialized [10:25] because when he walks them on the street [10:26] they want to meet every other dog so if [10:27] they learn that meeting a dog is not a [10:29] big deal then they're no longer going to [10:31] have that desire to want to meet every [10:32] dog i mean think about if you've been in [10:34] a cave your entire life you're going to [10:36] come out you're going to want to [10:36] high-five everybody but [10:38] you're not in a cave and you get to talk [10:40] to people on a daily basis so seeing a [10:42] new person really isn't a big deal [10:43] unless it's brian calum then you're [10:44] going to want to run and shake his hand [10:46] but besides that the dogs are going to [10:47] have a blast they're going to swim [10:48] they're going to do obedience every day [10:50] and they're going to have a lot of fun [10:51] as well socialization play is a huge [10:53] part of building that perfect dog so i'm [10:55] excited to move forward with this [10:56] training program and i'm super excited [10:58] for you guys to see the results what's [11:00] up guys uh i'm brian callan and i have [11:02] two dogs they're great dogs they're good [11:04] dogs love dogs problem is my dogs lack [11:06] discipline they don't do anything i tell [11:09] them in fact they do what they want when [11:11] they think it's a free country which is [11:13] hilarious because they're dogs so that's [11:15] why i got nate shomer now nate schomer [11:18] is a dog trainer you don't know him yet [11:21] but you will because he's got his own [11:22] show on animal planet called rescue dog [11:24] the super dog he's going to take my [11:26] problem dogs and turn them into super [11:28] dogs that's what he promised me and if [11:31] he doesn't i'm gonna have to ruin his [11:33] reputation before he even [11:35] has one [11:36] well [11:37] it was an interesting uh introduction uh [11:40] nate assessed my dogs [11:42] and uh i think he agrees that there's [11:44] some work to be done [11:45] so i'm looking forward to where it's [11:47] gonna be two weeks from now apparently [11:48] my dogs are gonna heal that means [11:50] they're gonna be at my knee they're [11:51] gonna sit when i stop and it's gonna [11:54] go down when i tell them to go down [11:55] they're going to climb [11:57] climb which is some term for get up on [12:00] that stump over there or get up on that [12:03] ledge or that bench i have no idea [12:05] apparently they're going to swim they're [12:07] going to do all kinds of stuff maybe [12:08] even roll over or spin [12:11] back flip [12:12] talk i got no idea apparently he can do [12:15] it all [12:16] we'll see [12:32] come [12:35] [Music] [12:42] [Music] [12:54] [Music] [13:12] do [13:15] [Music] [13:22] sit [13:23] yes [13:24] down [13:27]

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 278/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] before we start training our dogs we [00:02] should know what motivates them with any [00:04] dog i'm training i like to begin with [00:06] food and using the technique known as [00:08] luring now sometimes people tell me that [00:11] they're unable to use food because their [00:13] dogs simply are not motivated by it [00:15] first let me start by saying that every [00:18] dog has some interest in food what [00:20] varies is how intense the food [00:22] motivation is if you have a dog with low [00:24] food motivation there are a few [00:25] techniques that you can use in order to [00:27] increase that food drive most dogs that [00:29] have a low food motivation is usually [00:32] caused by a few things either the dog [00:34] has been over fed free fed given very [00:37] high value foods such as cooked steak or [00:39] sometimes just feeding out of a bowl can [00:41] cause this as a result the dog doesn't [00:44] seem to care that much about getting [00:46] treats as a reward a common technique [00:48] that can be used to correct a lack of [00:50] food drive is food deprivation now this [00:53] isn't as bad as it may sound for this [00:55] training you'll want to use meal time as [00:57] training time bring the dog out and [00:59] offer food as a training reward if the [01:01] dog's not interested no big deal put the [01:03] food away and try again at dinner again [01:06] if the dog is uninterested put the food [01:07] away and try again the next day continue [01:09] to do this until your dog is willing to [01:11] work for the food be sure not to give [01:13] your dog any food in between the [01:14] training the dog has to understand that [01:16] he'll only get the food that he works [01:18] for i've used this technique on [01:20] countless dogs and it has worked every [01:22] single time [01:23] when we first start teaching a new [01:25] command to a dog we like to start with [01:27] what's known as continual reinforcement [01:30] meaning we reward the dog for the [01:32] completion of every behavior that we're [01:34] teaching [01:35] but once the dog is performing the [01:37] behavior on the command alone meaning [01:39] without the help of the physical cue [01:41] then we can start to space out the [01:43] rewards the idea is that the dog must [01:46] believe that there is a possibility [01:48] he'll receive a reward but not that [01:50] he'll always receive a reward another [01:53] way to look at it is when you first [01:55] start training a dog you're a vending [01:57] machine every dollar behavior your dog [01:59] puts in they get the reward once your [02:02] dog knows the command you must [02:04] transition to the slot machine meaning [02:06] every dollar behavior your dog puts in [02:09] no longer guarantees a reward but the [02:11] hope is there just like people continue [02:13] to put money into the slot machines your [02:15] dog will continue to perform behaviors [02:17] for the possibility of that reward if [02:19] you do the transition correctly i also [02:22] think it's worth noting or talking about [02:24] free shaping this helps teach a dog to [02:26] perform behaviors with rewards out of [02:28] sight the concept is simple during the [02:30] day when your dog does a behavior that [02:31] you like mark can reward them for it but [02:34] don't let them know that you have [02:35] rewards on you do this with multiple [02:37] behaviors your dog will quickly start to [02:39] learn that their behaviors can make [02:42] rewards appear even if they don't see [02:44] the rewards this is very powerful and it [02:46] helps us create what's known as a [02:47] proactive dog i do have a video [02:50] dedicated to this subject if you want to [02:51] learn more about it i'll be sure to put [02:53] a link in the description of this video [02:55] now when do we want to use toys with [02:57] obedience if you have a dog that enjoys [03:00] toys you can start using that as a [03:02] motivating factor in your training [03:05] once i have a dog performing all the [03:06] commands on verbal alone and they no [03:09] longer need the reward after every [03:11] behavior this is a good point that we [03:13] can start to introduce the toys into our [03:15] obedience training [03:17] before using toys we need to make sure [03:19] that our dogs will give us the toy when [03:21] asked you know the drop it command we [03:24] can teach our dogs this command by [03:26] implementing value transfer i'll quickly [03:28] explain the process [03:31] just like everything else we teach our [03:32] dogs we want to make sure that we can [03:35] get the dog to do the behavior with the [03:38] physical cue before we add the command [03:41] now you want to have two toys of equal [03:45] value two completely identical toys will [03:48] work best for this first present one of [03:50] the toys have your dog look at you then [03:52] use your terminal marker i like to use [03:54] the word free to engage your dog into [03:56] play this will help create structure [03:58] during play by asking something from [04:00] your dog before giving them the toy if [04:02] you're playing with tug with your dog [04:04] then you'll do one of two things [04:05] depending on the dog so option one if [04:08] you're playing tug you will [04:10] stop moving which can be difficult for a [04:12] stronger dog or you'll release the toy [04:14] to the dog the second option works best [04:16] if your dog prefers to play tug with you [04:19] once the dog stops moving or after you [04:21] release the toy you will then give the [04:23] drop it command i prefer to use the word [04:25] out just be sure to say the command once [04:28] then bring out the new toy and make it [04:30] more interesting than the toy that the [04:32] dog currently has when done correctly [04:34] your dog will release the old toy to [04:37] play with the new toy after dog is used [04:40] to switching from the old toy to the new [04:42] toy and responding to the drop it [04:44] command you can then transition to the [04:46] same toy meaning you stay out your dog [04:48] releases then you use the terminal [04:51] marker and you allow them to re-engage [04:52] with the toy you're just using you want [04:55] to start to practice waiting for longer [04:57] periods between giving the toy back but [04:59] make it random meaning sometimes make [05:01] your dog wait and other times give it [05:03] back almost instantly you wouldn't want [05:05] to slowly extend the time each time [05:08] because it may demotivate the dog [05:10] make the time duration random eventually [05:13] your dog will know the drop it or your [05:15] dog will know to drop it after hearing [05:17] the command for a full demonstration i [05:19] do have a video on this it's called [05:20] easily teach your dog the drop it [05:22] command [05:23] when your dog becomes more proficient at [05:25] the drop it command we can start working [05:26] on the more advanced out [05:29] i'll explain while you're actively [05:31] playing tug say the drop it command [05:34] after you say the drop it command then [05:36] stop moving the toy at first your dog is [05:39] not going to out right away when you get [05:41] the command however [05:43] since you're saying out predicts the [05:45] stop or the freeze of the game [05:48] your dog will learn to release the toy [05:50] even if the toy is still active [05:53] now after doing all this we can start [05:54] training with a toy as a reward so the [05:57] way that i like to do that is after [05:59] giving your dog multiple commands you'll [06:01] want to start to use the terminal marker [06:02] and then allow your dog to play with the [06:04] toy if you have a dog that prefers to [06:06] play fetch you can throw the ball for [06:08] your dog and once your dog comes back to [06:10] you take the ball back using the drop of [06:12] command and go right back into more [06:13] training if you have a dog that prefers [06:15] to play tug like my dog ari you can use [06:18] your terminal marker and then follow it [06:21] with a short game of tug when you're [06:23] ready to do more obedience ask your dog [06:25] to release the tug and then go right [06:27] back into training this is an excellent [06:30] way to make the training even more fun [06:32] and engaging for your dog [06:34] but what if your dog doesn't have much [06:36] interest in toys well you can use a few [06:39] techniques to try and increase your [06:41] dog's toy drive just keep in mind that [06:43] not all dogs enjoy playing with toys [06:46] even if you do attempt to increase their [06:48] toy drive [06:50] the first technique is to clean your [06:52] house meaning if you have toys scattered [06:54] all over the place pick them up and put [06:56] them away it's much like free feeding a [06:59] dog why would your dog want to work for [07:00] something when they get it for free your [07:02] dog must believe that the only way he'll [07:04] be able to play with the toy is if he [07:06] works for it however once your dog is [07:09] willing to work for the toys you can [07:11] start allowing them to have toys for [07:13] free during the day [07:15] if the motivation seems to decrease [07:18] after you allow them to have toys again [07:19] for free during the day you can simply [07:21] repeat the process of cleaning house and [07:23] making your dog work for the toys the [07:25] next technique to enhance toy drive is [07:28] by building frustration let me explain [07:30] the process you'll want to follow first [07:32] attach a harness or an agitation collar [07:35] to your dog then either hold the leash [07:37] or connect the leash to a pole or any [07:39] other object to create a back tie if [07:42] you're holding the leash have a friend [07:44] begin teasing with a toy just beyond the [07:47] reach of the dog if the leash is [07:48] attached to a back tie then you can play [07:50] the role of the decoy which is often the [07:53] option that i choose building more [07:55] distance can often create more [07:56] frustration so build distance as needed [08:00] keep doing this until the dog becomes [08:02] frustrated enough to bark at this point [08:05] give verbal praise and reward the dog [08:07] with the toy for barking i also like to [08:09] pet the dog while i'm doing this [08:11] exercise but make sure you or your [08:13] friend holds on to the toy while the dog [08:16] plays with it you want to keep the toy [08:18] active and fun if the toy stops moving [08:20] the dog can become demotivated [08:23] if the dog releases the toy grab it run [08:27] back and continue to tease again until [08:29] the dog barks now it can become like a [08:32] game try to steal the toy from the dog [08:34] if the dog lets go of it again don't rip [08:36] it from the dog and if successful return [08:39] to teasing once again reward your dog if [08:42] he or she barks this helps build toy [08:45] drive because much like humans dogs want [08:47] what they can't have this works best [08:49] when you start this during the [08:51] imprinting stage of a dog's life however [08:54] it can work later in the dog's life as [08:56] well [08:58] [Music] [09:02]

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 281/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we will be discussing [00:01] confidence building counter conditioning [00:04] and desensitization [00:06] confidence in a dog is much like [00:08] confidence in a human almost universally [00:11] it is a positive characteristic as a dog [00:14] trainer often owners will tell me about [00:16] obedience issues that their dogs are [00:18] having not realizing that it's actually [00:20] a confidence issue an example might be a [00:23] dog who's shaky scared to try new things [00:26] fearful of ordinary situations or [00:28] prefers to ignore his owner instead of [00:31] doing something uncomfortable [00:33] the solution they may say is i want my [00:35] dog to become submissive [00:37] so it stops acting anxious and does [00:40] whatever i tell him to do [00:42] however contrary to popular belief we [00:45] don't want a submissive dog in a dog's [00:48] mind submission means look how small i [00:51] am please don't hurt me why would you [00:54] ever want to make a dog feel that way [00:57] the dog may [00:58] push itself to do certain behaviors if [01:00] it's truly become submissive but it's [01:03] out of fear [01:04] at the end of the day you have a fearful [01:06] dog [01:07] not a confident dog [01:09] by contrast a confident dog is much [01:12] easier to train a dog that is willing to [01:14] try new things is much easier to train [01:16] than a dog with fearful characteristics [01:19] this means far fewer problems with your [01:21] dog down the road compared to having a [01:24] submissive fearful dog [01:26] often younger and adolescent dogs will [01:28] go through a period of fearful behavior [01:30] often referred to as the fear period and [01:33] seemingly losing confidence for example [01:35] at seven months of age one of my dogs [01:37] went through a fear period where she was [01:39] afraid of people [01:41] when she would see someone new her [01:43] hackles would go up she would [01:44] continuously bark while backing up and [01:47] when she first started to display this [01:49] behavior i knew that i needed to fix it [01:52] as soon as possible [01:53] lucky for me i have a lot of dog trainer [01:55] friends that were able to help with the [01:57] process for two weeks i personally did [02:00] not feed my dog but instead i had my dog [02:03] training friends feed her from their [02:05] hands it was a progressive process as [02:08] they couldn't just give her the food [02:09] right away because she was cautious of [02:11] them so instead they would stand with [02:12] their backs facing her their hands down [02:14] by their side palm facing outward and [02:17] she was able to in a sense steal in her [02:20] mind the food from their hands [02:22] as she became more confident they [02:24] started to turn more towards her [02:26] eventually they would be able to bend [02:28] down and feed her from their hand while [02:30] petting her so by doing this we were [02:33] able to create for her a very strong and [02:36] positive association with new people new [02:39] people now give her the same positive [02:41] feeling that she received when she was [02:43] being rewarded by my friends [02:46] if your puppy or adolescent dog is [02:48] having fear problems there are some [02:50] considerations to make [02:52] one thing you don't want to do is [02:53] reinforce the fear-based behavior by [02:55] petting them while they are acting [02:57] fearful however you also don't want to [03:00] use a physical correction to attempt to [03:03] fix the problem as this is almost a [03:05] guarantee to make the fear worse [03:08] instead there are things we can do with [03:10] a puppy or an adult dog to increase [03:13] their confidence similar to the disney [03:15] character bolt we can build a dog's [03:17] confidence by making them believe they [03:19] are a super dog this can be done through [03:22] confidence building activities or [03:24] confidence building exercises an easy [03:26] way to look at confidence building is to [03:28] take something that the dog may be [03:30] unsure about and make it predict [03:32] something pleasant for example let's say [03:34] you want to get your dog comfortable [03:36] with different sounds so you fill an [03:39] empty kiddie pool with empty plastic [03:41] bottles for the pup to play in now at [03:43] first the puppy or dog may be hesitant [03:46] but if you demonstrate that it's fun by [03:48] either getting into the pool first or [03:50] luring the puppy or dog into the pool [03:52] they'll quickly discover that it's a fun [03:54] activity and the puppy or dog will [03:56] associate the sound of the plastic [03:58] bottles with fun [04:00] this is something that a lot of [04:01] protection dog trainers will do with [04:03] their puppies because in some of the [04:04] protection sports they'll use what's [04:06] called a bottle curtain which is [04:08] basically a bunch of empty plastic [04:10] bottles hanging from a pole in a [04:12] curtain-like fashion that the dog will [04:14] have to run through simply put it's [04:16] about constantly exposing your dog to [04:18] new things and making those activities [04:21] pleasant by predicting something the dog [04:24] enjoys [04:25] i'll go over a few confidence building [04:27] exercise that i like to do with puppies [04:29] and dogs that i work with [04:31] first we want to expose our dogs to [04:33] different sounds while providing rewards [04:35] starting at a very low volume and [04:38] increasing as the dog becomes more [04:40] confident you could also have the dog [04:42] walk on multiple different types of [04:43] surfaces while giving them treats an [04:45] example could be having a dog walk on [04:47] something like bubble wrap [04:50] playing tug is always a great way to [04:53] build a dog's confidence by allowing [04:54] them to win if we want the toy from a [04:57] dog we use the drop it command we never [05:00] physically rip the toy away from the dog [05:02] because that would have the opposite [05:04] effect again we're trying to build the [05:05] dog's confidence having the dog walk on [05:07] elevated surfaces while providing [05:09] rewards but making sure the dog doesn't [05:11] fall which that could also have the [05:14] opposite effect taking the dog to [05:16] different environments for training and [05:18] making it a fun positive experience [05:20] gradually increasing the amount of [05:23] motivating factors in the environment as [05:25] the dog becomes more confident you could [05:27] also create a puppy or dog obstacle [05:29] course in your yard or your house now [05:31] these are just a few examples but you [05:33] can see how the process works try being [05:35] creative when doing confidence building [05:37] exercises with your own dog now [05:39] confidence building helps prevent a dog [05:41] from having fear issues but what if [05:43] those issues are already present in our [05:45] dogs this is when we use counter [05:47] conditioning and desensitization counter [05:50] conditioning is very similar to [05:51] confidence building but the main [05:53] difference is that we are using counter [05:55] conditioning to help with the dog to [05:56] overcome something they may already be [05:58] afraid of for example let's say your dog [06:01] is afraid of the vacuum cleaner first [06:02] start by breaking the vacuum cleaner [06:04] down then introduce one piece at a time [06:07] and reward your dog for each piece then [06:09] start to assemble the vacuum one piece [06:12] at a time with each piece assembled [06:14] reward your dog then start rewarding the [06:16] dog with high value rewards once the [06:18] vacuum has been fully assembled the dog [06:21] will start to associate the vacuum [06:22] cleaner with high value rewards [06:25] start moving the vacuum cleaner around [06:27] the carpet turned off again reward the [06:29] dog for behaving and being comfortable [06:31] but don't reward them if they start to [06:33] bark at the vacuum turn the vacuum [06:35] cleaner on then off treating it like a [06:37] marker and rewarding your dog keep [06:39] turning it on and off and eventually [06:41] leave it on and reward your dog now your [06:44] dog will no longer associate the vacuum [06:46] cleaner with something negative you can [06:48] also simulate the sound on your phone by [06:50] starting it at a low volume and [06:52] gradually increasing as the dog becomes [06:54] more confident [06:56] here's another few examples when [06:58] training a sport protection dog they [07:00] have to become desensitized to gunshots [07:03] because one of the exercises requires a [07:06] dog to bite the decoy [07:08] while the decoy is firing a blank pistol [07:11] trainers do this by first firing the [07:13] blank pistol at a distance that doesn't [07:16] bother the dog as the dog becomes more [07:18] comfortable with the sound they slowly [07:20] over time bring the gunfire closer and [07:23] closer to the dog until the dog isn't [07:26] troubled at all by it keep in mind that [07:28] each dog will take a different amount of [07:30] time to learn a new behavior or to [07:32] increase in confidence [07:34] i had a dog that i was working with a [07:36] few years back that was terrified in [07:38] public and in two weeks we were able to [07:40] fix the issue and if you have guessed [07:43] that i used a combination of [07:45] desensitization and counter conditioning [07:48] you would be right first i only fed the [07:51] dog and did obedience outside of the [07:53] house the first day i was in my front [07:55] yard training as the days progressed i [07:57] slowly moved to more locations with [08:00] slightly more activity as the dog's [08:02] confidence went up i went to even more [08:04] locations with more activity by the [08:06] second week i was doing obedience with [08:08] the dog at the local home depot and [08:10] petsmart it's important to keep in mind [08:12] that i did not feed the dog in the house [08:14] where the dog was comfortable i wanted [08:16] the dog to associate the public [08:18] locations with the pleasant experience [08:20] of training and food reward [08:23] so rather than having a relationship [08:25] based on fear or the belief that the [08:27] owner needs to be the alpha it's much [08:29] better to work with our dogs on the same [08:32] team towards a common goal [08:36] [Music] [08:40] thanks again as always be sure to check [08:43] out the other training instructional [08:44] videos on my youtube channel get a copy [08:47] of my dog

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 284/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] generally it's a good idea to introduce [00:02] your dog to increasingly challenging [00:04] environments and levels of obedience [00:06] training also known as grading this [00:08] includes the levels of the tasks levels [00:10] of obedience levels of proficiency and [00:14] the intensity of the environment which [00:16] is also part of your training for your [00:17] dog's social skills [00:19] since i'll be going over different [00:21] obedience routines throughout this [00:23] series such as akc novice and open [00:26] having a well-socialized dog is going to [00:28] play a giant role in the success of [00:30] every dog that you train this is very [00:33] important information because without [00:35] being aware of these guidelines you [00:36] could be causing yourself a lot of [00:39] unnecessary stress during your training [00:41] for example you wouldn't want to ask for [00:44] an advanced task from a dog that is [00:46] still at a low proficiency level in a [00:48] highly intense environment you can see [00:50] how that would be setting yourself and [00:53] your dog up for failure on the flip side [00:55] you would just want to start your [00:56] training at low obedience level in a [00:59] low-key environment using beginner tasks [01:02] that would make way more sense and then [01:04] gradually build as your dog is [01:06] successful therefore part of your [01:08] training process is knowing how to grade [01:10] your dog's skill and ability to work in [01:12] different environments another part of [01:14] that's closely related to grading the [01:16] environments is the process of [01:18] socializing [01:20] socializing doesn't mean just allowing [01:22] your dog to play with all the other dogs [01:25] in the neighborhood or jumping up on [01:27] every person the dog sees the big idea [01:30] is to expose your dog to new situations [01:33] people and environments this leads to a [01:36] dog that's adjusted for many situations [01:38] and has a very balanced personality [01:42] during this training it's essential to [01:44] control the situation for example you [01:46] wouldn't want your dog to be exposed to [01:48] an aggressive dog at your nearby park [01:50] thus associating that park with the [01:53] confrontation or worse making your dog [01:55] fearful and aggressive towards other [01:57] dogs your dog should also avoid humans [02:00] with poor skills around animals [02:03] speaking of if you plan on training or [02:05] socializing your dog it's also important [02:08] to consider pet insurance well it's also [02:11] a good idea to have the dog couch [02:13] potatoes covered as well if you've been [02:15] thinking about pet insurance but haven't [02:17] decided on a company then prudent pet [02:19] insurance may be for you prudent pet is [02:22] the ultimate option to make sure your [02:24] four-legged family members are covered [02:26] and protected their pet insurance plans [02:28] cover a variety of needs for your pet [02:30] with a ton of customizable options they [02:32] have a 30-day money-back guarantee [02:35] they're the number one rated pet [02:36] insurance on trust pilot they have a 24 [02:39] 7 veterinarian chat line and if you sign [02:42] up through the link in the description [02:43] you'll get five percent off [02:46] socializing is therefore a process that [02:48] involves introducing your dog to new [02:49] situations to help him or her learn in a [02:52] positive way this can include bringing [02:54] your dog around other well-behaved dogs [02:56] owners who reinforce positive behavior [02:58] and activities that you think your dog [03:00] might enjoy [03:02] first let's break down the elements of [03:05] grading [03:06] you have obedience levels [03:09] dogs like humans [03:11] gradually will become more proficient at [03:13] what they're trying to learn [03:15] starting out and when working with a dog [03:17] who's new to training it's usually a [03:19] good idea to begin at the first stage of [03:21] obedience in time a dog may graduate to [03:24] a full obedience level [03:26] able to perform a wide variety of tasks [03:29] the journey to get there is going to be [03:31] faster or slower depending on the [03:32] individual characteristics of the dog [03:34] that you're training [03:36] here are the four stages one [03:39] little to no obedience simply not [03:42] allowing the dog to practice bad [03:44] behaviors but not yet trying to teach [03:47] specific commands [03:48] two would be very little obedience this [03:51] is when we ask the dog to perform a few [03:53] easy commands that they can get [03:55] proficient at three is going to be [03:58] medium obedience implementing a few more [04:01] complicated commands and more [04:03] repetitions of the easy commands [04:05] four is full obedience this would be the [04:08] final stage when asking the dog to [04:10] perform all obedience or service dog [04:13] tasks likewise it's possible to grade a [04:15] dog's proficiency during obedience [04:17] training how long for a dog to become [04:19] highly proficient may depend on the [04:20] dog's level of perseverance [04:23] next is the command proficiency level [04:25] first is going to be no proficiency when [04:27] the dog is unable to follow any level of [04:30] obedience training second is slightly [04:33] proficient this is when your dog can [04:35] take on basic tasks and basic positions [04:38] such as having your dog sit for reward [04:41] third is mostly proficient this is when [04:43] your dog can undertake basic tasks [04:45] quickly and easily and is capable of [04:47] learning more complex tasks fourth is [04:50] completely proficient this dog is [04:53] skilled at all learned tasks and can [04:56] quickly take on new tasks from basic [04:58] to advance [05:00] so now let's define the task levels it's [05:04] important to also grade your dog's [05:06] actual tasks based on levels of [05:08] difficulty this is fairly [05:10] straightforward a basic task is what we [05:13] all know such as sit down come loose [05:15] leash walking stay etc advanced tasks [05:19] will be service dog tasks and other [05:21] advanced obedience concepts such as [05:23] retrieval training or a focused heal [05:26] we also have to consider environmental [05:29] stimulation and intensity levels this is [05:32] going to play a significant role in your [05:34] dog's training a superstar dog is able [05:37] to perform advanced tasks even in very [05:40] distracting environments but most dogs [05:43] are not at that level and must start at [05:45] a much more slower pace [05:47] almost no stimulations would be a place [05:50] your dog is very comfortable at such as [05:53] your home [05:54] very little stimulation would be a place [05:56] your dog is comfortable at but with some [05:59] natural distractions an example of this [06:02] could be your front or your backyard [06:04] somewhat intense would be a new [06:07] environment that has some distractions [06:10] but not so many that the dog is going to [06:12] become overwhelmed [06:14] high stimulation or most intense would [06:17] be a new environment with multiple [06:18] distractions such as a very busy park [06:21] that has people grilling food kids [06:23] playing and dogs running around [06:25] now let's go deeper into the concept of [06:27] stimulating environments and getting [06:29] your dog used to performing with other [06:31] dogs around the main goal with this [06:34] element of the training process is [06:35] desensitization i've talked about this [06:38] in some of my other videos this is the [06:39] technique of making your dog less [06:41] reactive to a stimulus that would [06:43] ordinarily cause a bad reaction such as [06:45] chasing after a dog or strangers this is [06:48] done by exposing the dog to the stimulus [06:51] at a very low level until there is no [06:53] response gradually as you increase the [06:56] stimulation over time the dog will [06:58] become less or even non-reactive the [07:01] process of socializing and desensitizing [07:03] a dog could mean first taking the dog to [07:05] a park in the early morning without any [07:07] other dogs or people around later as you [07:10] increase the intensity you might return [07:12] to the park in the afternoon or on a [07:13] sunday where there's more people and [07:15] dogs [07:16] the goal is for the dog to behave the [07:18] same way in either situation so be sure [07:21] not to progress with this too quickly at [07:24] the beginning you'll want to start with [07:25] low levels on all the stages we just [07:28] discussed so a low intensity area low [07:30] task level low obedience level [07:33] you can start to move to higher levels [07:35] once it seems clear that the dog has [07:37] become proficient when moving into a [07:40] situation with higher environmental [07:42] intensities start again with low [07:44] obedience levels this will increase with [07:47] the speed of the individual dog [07:49] eventually like before the dog will [07:51] master this environment [07:54] here's something to aim for with your [07:56] dogs as you work through these different [07:58] levels of training and how to know that [08:00] you're making progress much of our [08:02] socializing process is more about [08:04] exposure and less about contact however [08:06] part of the process of socializing the [08:08] dog is to reinforce the dog's social [08:10] skills around people and other dogs [08:12] ensuring that the dog is not aggressive [08:14] or reactive in any way this requires [08:17] controlling the situation so the dog can [08:19] have nothing but pleasant experiences [08:21] with other dogs and humans this will [08:23] also help prevent fear or aggression [08:26] issues in the dog you're training a busy [08:28] area with other people's random dogs [08:30] such as a dog park may not be a good [08:32] idea compared to maybe a barbecue with [08:34] friends who are savvy dog people who [08:36] have well-behaved dogs that don't reward [08:40] bad behavior such as jumping [08:42] if you can't find such a group of people [08:44] you can also check online for different [08:46] groups such as meetup.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 288/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] sometimes fear and aggression are taught [00:02] behaviors but in many cases it can also [00:05] be caused by genetics [00:07] people often underestimate how much [00:09] genetics have an effect in the dog's [00:11] training and abilities the goal of [00:13] today's episode is to give you an idea [00:15] of what you might be dealing with and as [00:18] a professional dog trainer you may have [00:20] to deal with aggressive dogs this video [00:22] is for instructional purposes only i've [00:24] tried my best to make this video as [00:26] black and white as possible however [00:29] there are many gray areas when it comes [00:31] to working with a dog that has [00:33] aggressive issues first let's discuss [00:36] communication [00:37] versus aggression [00:39] before moving forward there's an [00:41] important point to understand on more [00:44] than one occasion i've had clients tell [00:46] me that their dog is aggressive when [00:48] they show me this aggressive behavior [00:50] that their dog is performing it becomes [00:53] very clear to me that it's not [00:55] aggression but rather [00:56] communication since dogs are unable to [00:59] communicate at the same level we can we [01:02] have to be able to read their body [01:03] languages as well as their vocal [01:06] communications as they may be signaling [01:08] possible aggressive behaviors before it [01:10] happens [01:11] many owners don't realize this and i've [01:12] been told by people that have been [01:14] bitten by a dog that the dog gave zero [01:17] warning however this usually isn't true [01:20] in fact dogs telegraph most of their [01:23] behaviors which is why it's important to [01:25] become familiar with the signals your [01:26] dog may be demonstrating before biting [01:29] or acting aggressively [01:31] we'll quickly go over some of these [01:33] warning signs to help you in case you [01:35] are in one of these situations [01:37] sudden link lipping [01:39] yawning [01:40] tail between the legs ears going back [01:43] looking away [01:45] staring intently at the bite target [01:48] the dog's hackles going up these are all [01:50] signs that may be telling us to humans [01:53] to stop doing whatever it is that we're [01:55] currently doing and if those don't work [01:57] the dog may escalate to growling or [02:00] showing their teeth and even trying to [02:02] walk away if walking away doesn't work [02:05] then once again the dog may escalate to [02:08] actual aggression [02:09] the dog may even give a warning bite [02:12] these behaviors are known as the [02:14] escalation of aggression [02:16] keep in mind that these behaviors don't [02:18] always mean the dog is going to bite a [02:20] dog that has been taught to [02:22] have proper bite inhibition may also [02:25] bite at the human in an attempt to get [02:28] the human to go away or to back off [02:30] without causing any injury you have to [02:32] keep in mind the context of the [02:34] situation just like a person who may be [02:37] cold will cross their arms it doesn't [02:39] always mean that they are closed off or [02:41] angry [02:42] often people will also confuse play with [02:44] aggression in many cases dogs while [02:46] playing will growl or even mouth at the [02:48] person that they're playing with this [02:50] doesn't mean that the dog is aggressive [02:52] this type of play can also be important [02:54] for a young dog's development as it [02:56] could help teach bite inhibition [02:58] you can stop this by redirecting the dog [03:00] to a toy [03:02] a different behavior such as a climb [03:04] command or teaching them to stop it with [03:06] a command i do this by implementing [03:08] leash pressure or value transfer which i [03:11] do have videos on that [03:12] dogs will also correct other dogs this [03:15] is often seen when older dog corrects a [03:17] younger puppy the dog may growl at the [03:20] puppy or even snap or do a quick bite of [03:22] the puppy the dog's intention is to not [03:25] hurt the pup but rather teach the pup a [03:28] lesson such as respecting the other [03:31] dog's boundaries this is much different [03:33] from a dog that is attacking another dog [03:35] to cause harm an aggressive dog that is [03:38] attacking another dog will bite hold on [03:40] and shake to cause damage [03:42] so let's discuss four main types of [03:44] aggression towards humans that you may [03:46] experience when working with a dog first [03:49] one is [03:50] dogs that bluff [03:52] dogs that will act aggressive in order [03:54] to get a specific desired behavior from [03:56] the human i like to call these dogs [03:58] fakers or dogs using fake aggression [04:01] they're trying to manipulate a human to [04:03] get a reward but may not actually have [04:06] hostile intentions or hostile feelings [04:10] next is fear-based aggression it's the [04:12] most common type of aggression this [04:14] behavior is usually due to trauma [04:16] genetics lack of exposure or conflict in [04:18] the dog's personality they're acting in [04:21] a defensive and hostile way to people or [04:24] other animals [04:25] third is aggression that develops from [04:28] confusion what i mean by that is [04:30] it's when a dog doesn't know what's [04:32] expected of them they don't know how to [04:34] avoid prevent or stop a correction from [04:37] happening they haven't been given a [04:39] clear path to success which can result [04:42] in confusion this is the most [04:44] again in my opinion preventable type of [04:47] aggression [04:48] as caused by mistakes made by us the [04:50] humans this is also why it's very [04:52] important to always be consistent with [04:54] your dog's training last is dominant [04:57] aggression this is the most least common [05:01] form of aggression that i've seen since [05:04] 2012 when i started training dogs [05:05] professionally i've only come across two [05:08] dogs that were dominant aggressive [05:10] these dogs may bite regardless of being [05:13] provoked or not [05:14] alright so i want to go into more detail [05:17] about the dogs that bluff so we're gonna [05:19] discuss our fakers it's imperative to be [05:22] aware that a puppy or a dog may be using [05:25] aggressive behaviors as a way to get the [05:27] desired outcome by manipulating the [05:30] owner it's important to stop these [05:32] behaviors before it develops into real [05:34] aggression fake aggression or fake [05:37] aggressive behaviors originate usually [05:40] from owners teaching or reinforcing [05:41] these behaviors without realizing it an [05:44] example could be your puppy's on the [05:45] couch you try to get your puppy off the [05:46] couch the puppy growls and so you leave [05:49] the puppy there what happens next is the [05:51] dog grows up and this behavior has [05:53] become hardwired into adulthood while it [05:55] may have felt innocent or even cute when [05:58] the dog was a small fluffy little puppy [06:00] the adult version of the puppy growling [06:03] from the couch is now threatening and [06:04] scary these behaviors may start as fake [06:08] or bluffs but if it's not stopped early [06:10] the bites could become real [06:13] what should be done in a situation like [06:15] this is to act like you're not even [06:17] acknowledging the growl from the puppy [06:19] and then simply get the pup off the [06:22] couch i'll just grab them by their [06:24] collar and nicely pull them off ignoring [06:26] any attempt they may make to try to [06:28] prevent this including biting at my hand [06:31] even though they have sharp little teeth [06:33] the bite force usually is not strong [06:35] enough to cause any harm and once they [06:38] realize that it doesn't work they stop [06:40] using it as a technique [06:43] this way the puppy learns that growling [06:45] doesn't work keep in mind that most [06:47] puppies who are growling are trying to [06:49] get a result from the owner fear [06:51] aggression is possible of course and [06:53] dominant aggression is going to be [06:54] significantly more rare [06:56] next is a list of some of the common [06:58] ways a puppy may appear to be aggressive [07:02] most of these will go away if it doesn't [07:04] have a positive effect [07:06] for the dog or the puppy [07:08] biting at your hand when trying to take [07:10] a toy from the puppy [07:12] biting or growling when taking away food [07:15] biting at your hand when putting on a [07:18] collar or a leash [07:20] aggressively rushing at house guests who [07:23] enter [07:24] acting aggressive inside the crate [07:27] growling barking or snapping if given a [07:30] command [07:31] or aggression towards other dogs [07:34] this becomes more of an issue if it's an [07:36] adult dog that has been practicing the [07:38] behavior for a while and to make matters [07:40] worse if something has been working for [07:42] a dog for a long time and one day it [07:45] doesn't work the dog may amp up the [07:48] behavior to get what they want because [07:50] in their mind that behavior still works [07:53] but may suddenly require extra effort [07:56] therefore it can get worse before it [07:58] gets better this is known as an [08:01] extinction burst the behavior becomes [08:04] more intense before it drops off [08:07] if i'm working with an adult dog that is [08:09] displaying this behavior when i ask them [08:11] to do something [08:12] i make sure to always follow through to [08:15] guarantee they perform the action [08:17] however i'm also very careful not to get [08:20] bit in case that the dog decides to [08:23] escalate the aggression to an actual [08:25] bite all right for example [08:28] let's once again reference [08:30] a dog instead of a puppy that refuses to [08:32] come off the couch [08:34] i would first set the situation up so i [08:36] can best control it meaning i would make [08:38] sure the dog has a and collar on i would [08:40] give the dog a chance to jump up on the [08:42] couch once the dog jumps up on the couch [08:45] i would say wrong or off whatever it is [08:47] i'm using with that dog then i would use [08:49] the leash pressure to pull the dog back [08:51] off the couch [08:53] in this situation some dogs may growl [08:56] but will be fine once you follow through [08:58] and you pull them off the couch i've had [09:00] other dogs lunge at me at which point i [09:02] would use the leash to prevent the dog [09:03] from biting me by lifting up on the [09:05] lesion extending my arm restricting the [09:08] dog's forward movement [09:09] as mentioned in some of my other videos [09:12] never make anything personal by yelling [09:14] or getting angry at the dog i always try [09:17] to keep in mind simple cause and effect [09:19] once the dog realizes that this bluffing [09:22] doesn't work on you then the behavior [09:24] will usually go away just keep in mind [09:26] that the longer a dog has been [09:28] practicing this the harder it will be [09:30] for the dog to break that behavior or [09:32] for you to break the behavior from the [09:34] dog [09:35] next is dogs that resource guard dogs [09:38] and puppy may use fake bluffing [09:41] aggression to guard their resources such [09:43] as toys or food [09:44] when in a situation like this i may have [09:47] to use the superman method depending on [09:50] the dog to get the dog to relinquish the [09:52] resource and learn that being aggressive [09:55] is not an option however keep in mind [09:57] that constantly harassing a dog while [10:00] they're eating could be the cause of the [10:02] aggression meaning when you give your [10:04] dog or puppy something don't take it [10:07] away just to show them that you're the [10:09] alpha when feeding a dog or giving them [10:12] a bone or stuffed kong outside of a [10:14] training session for example i find it [10:16] best to give them these rewards in their [10:19] crate it usually helps the puppy or dog [10:21] relax more because we're removing the [10:24] possible feeling that someone or [10:25] something is going to take the treat [10:27] away from them especially if you have [10:29] multiple dogs [10:30] for puppies and dogs that are less [10:32] likely to bite my preferred method is to [10:34] teach the dog that a hand coming towards [10:36] them predicts something positive such as [10:39] petting a treat or toy being delivered [10:42] you can see an excellent example of this [10:45] in the how to stop puppy resource [10:47] guarding video that i did with bethany [10:50] from ph dogs [10:51] since she does such a great job [10:53] explaining and demonstrating this [10:54] process i would recommend watching that [10:57] to understand and learn this technique [10:59] i'll make sure i put it in the [11:00] description below [11:02] now if i'm going to use a superman [11:04] technique so you can get an idea of what [11:05] that is i would first set up the session [11:08] to ensure success as well as safety [11:10] first i would place a dog on a back tie [11:12] to prevent them from being able to move [11:14] forward to bite me next i would give the [11:16] dog the item they usually resource guard [11:18] you can also place a muzzle on the dog [11:20] but i prefer to show the dog that the [11:22] biting doesn't work instead of [11:24] preventing the dog from biting only when [11:26] they have the muzzle on but that is an [11:28] option and it's a good step to be extra [11:29] safe in the beginning [11:31] when doing this i have protective gear [11:33] on including long gloves to prevent [11:35] injury from dog biting this is [11:38] if the dog i'm working with has the [11:40] ability to cause harm a puppy wouldn't [11:43] be really necessary for that next i [11:45] place my hand over the resource the dog [11:47] may try to bite me if they do i don't [11:49] correct the dog with positive punishment [11:51] as this could actually make it worse i [11:53] simply keep my hand over the toilet food [11:55] and let the dog bite and fight [11:57] once the dog stops biting i say good job [12:00] and i remove my hand this helps show [12:03] them that biting doesn't work but [12:05] instead not biting the hand is what gets [12:08] it to go away i give them what they want [12:10] when they give me what i want and i [12:12] repeat this process as many times as it [12:13] takes for the dog to stop biting at my [12:15] hand we're showing the dog that just [12:18] because a hand is coming it doesn't mean [12:20] you're going to take the resource away [12:22] it also teaches a dog that biting won't [12:24] help when doing this with an older dog [12:26] they may again amp the behavior up that [12:29] extinction burst that we talked about [12:30] earlier which means growling is more [12:32] likely to turn into actual biting with [12:34] older dogs it may be better to teach the [12:36] drop it command and if they don't drop [12:38] it reinforce with the correction as [12:40] opposed to using the superman method [12:42] this technique is better suited for [12:44] puppies who can't really hurt you in [12:47] addition if one bite location is not [12:50] working for the dog they may try to bite [12:52] a new location on the human so be aware [12:54] of this behavior when dealing with all [12:56] forms of aggression [12:58] next is resource guarding a territory if [13:01] a dog is resource guarding something [13:03] like a couch usually the best option is [13:05] to use obedience training with a leash [13:08] if they act aggressive just use the [13:09] leash and pull them off the couch to [13:11] show the dog that [13:13] it doesn't work for them to do that [13:15] you'll want to set the dog up ahead of [13:17] time with the collar and leash again [13:18] like we talked about earlier within [13:20] their protective territory and be [13:23] prepared to use the leash pressure if [13:24] the dog begins guarding that territory [13:27] make sure there is a distance between [13:29] yourself and the dog to prevent a bite [13:31] and in the event of a large aggressive [13:33] dog [13:34] protective gear is highly recommended [13:37] so what about resource guarding a human [13:40] sometimes the owner of the dog is the [13:42] resource that the dog is aggressively [13:43] guarding if this happens it can often be [13:46] corrected if the owner implements [13:47] positive punishment to teach the dog [13:49] it's not an okay behavior [13:52] the important point is that the owner [13:54] should be the one correcting the dog [13:56] someone who's not the resource being [13:59] guarded may actually create more [14:01] aggression if they try to correct the [14:03] dog while the dog is resource guarding [14:05] their owner from my experience it's [14:07] better when the owner corrects the dog [14:09] for this behavior basically tell them [14:11] hey i don't need you to protect me i got [14:13] this however you may also use negative [14:16] punishment to stop this behavior this [14:18] works when you're dealing with a chicken [14:20] with a bodyguard as my good friend [14:22] bethany would say which means a dog that [14:24] is acting aggressive and confident [14:26] because it's being held by the owner or [14:28] is next to the owner once the owner [14:30] walks away the aggression stops here's [14:33] how you can set up a situation to deal [14:35] with this or set up a scenario to help [14:37] facilitate this have the dog on a back [14:40] tie next to the owner when you approach [14:42] the dog if it starts acting aggressive [14:45] have the owner walk away from the dog [14:48] again cause and effect this will teach [14:49] the dog that the unwanted behavior will [14:52] remove the dog's bodyguard after [14:54] implementing this enough times through [14:56] controlled training sessions different [14:58] locations and different people [15:00] approaching to generalize the training [15:02] the behavior may go away [15:04] next is fear-based aggression [15:06] as mentioned earlier this is one of the [15:08] most common types of aggression and can [15:11] often be fixed with confidence building [15:13] counter conditioning and desensitization [15:16] which i talked about in a video a few [15:18] weeks ago and in multiple other videos [15:20] that i have on my channel it's also [15:22] important to always give this type of [15:24] dog an escape if they feel they can't [15:26] escape a situation then they may bite in [15:28] the dog's mind [15:30] they're not biting to hurt the human but [15:33] rather to protect themselves [15:35] when working with dogs that display this [15:37] type of aggression i like to follow a [15:40] step-by-step process now please keep in [15:42] mind before we begin this is the process [15:45] that i use for clients dogs and i'm [15:47] training that have fear aggression [15:48] issues but not my own personal dogs with [15:51] your own dog you can skip the first four [15:53] steps of building trust and confidence [15:55] since you should already have that [15:57] developed [15:59] to be safe it's always best to have [16:01] protective bike gear first we need to [16:03] build trust and the first step is i'll [16:05] just sit next to the crate while the [16:07] dog's in the crate i may give them some [16:09] food but really i'm just trying to hang [16:11] out with them [16:12] what i'll be very careful of not doing [16:14] is rewarding the dog if they are [16:16] growling or acting aggressive because [16:18] that could have the opposite effect of [16:19] this exercise so if the dog starts to [16:22] growl it doesn't get any rewards i may [16:24] do this for up to an hour or so [16:26] depending on the dog's behavior the next [16:28] step is to open the crate let the dog [16:30] out and i just ignore him or her i act [16:33] as though the dog is not even in the [16:34] room with me meaning i don't let the dog [16:36] see me look at them and i don't talk to [16:38] the dog usually i'll watch the dog [16:40] through the camera on my phone so it [16:42] looks like i'm looking at the phone and [16:43] not the dog [16:45] eventually they'll come up to me they [16:46] usually investigate me by smelling me or [16:49] my legs once the dog starts to show [16:51] interest then i slowly start to walk [16:54] around the room dropping treats on the [16:56] floor for the dog to pick up if they get [16:58] even more comfortable doing this and i'm [17:00] not seeing any outward signs of [17:02] aggression i may stand with the food in [17:04] my hand facing away [17:06] so i'll basically have the food in my [17:07] hand i'm looking away it gives a dog the [17:09] ability to take the food from my hand [17:12] without me facing them if the dog gets [17:14] more comfortable with that i may start [17:15] to become even more frontal allowing the [17:17] dog to take the food directly from me [17:20] then if i feel the dog is becoming even [17:22] more comfortable with me while taking [17:23] food from my hand i'll try to pet them [17:26] to see if there's a reaction or if [17:28] there's any signs there's going to be [17:29] aggression like we talked about earlier [17:31] what you don't want to do is pet the dog [17:32] with your hand going straight towards a [17:34] dog's head this type of movement can [17:36] trigger aggression instead you want to [17:38] move nice and slowly [17:40] to teach a dog to be comfortable with [17:42] hands coming forward [17:44] put food in one hand and keep your other [17:46] hand free and bring both hands towards a [17:48] dog at the exact same time feeding and [17:51] petting [17:52] i may pet their chest at first as this [17:55] part of their body is less likely to [17:57] trigger aggression this is really about [17:59] building trust [18:00] once they trust me and they're [18:02] comfortable i'll begin with the normal [18:04] training process using again slow [18:07] movements most of the time until they [18:09] become really comfortable and their [18:10] confidence starts to go up during the [18:13] training process you'll want to use [18:15] counter conditioning and desensitization [18:17] to help them [18:18] get over whatever it is that they're [18:20] afraid of this process basically depends [18:22] on identifying what causes the dog's [18:24] fear and using high value rewards to [18:27] change the feelings towards those [18:28] situations this process is likely to be [18:31] different for every individual dog and [18:34] this is where the skill of dog training [18:36] really comes into play [18:38] what if the fearful dog doesn't want to [18:40] come out of the crate [18:42] fearful dogs will often prefer to stay [18:45] in the crate over coming out to train if [18:47] that's the case i do like to follow a [18:50] specific process [18:52] first i'll try to introduce the fearful [18:54] dog to leash pressure before attempting [18:56] to get them in and out of the crate [18:58] being careful the whole time and using [19:00] very slow and gentle movements [19:03] the first issue that may arise is a dog [19:05] will go into the crate but they're too [19:08] afraid to get out of the crate for this [19:10] reason let them go into a crate but keep [19:12] the leash on them then you can use the [19:15] leash to guide them out [19:17] alternatively just wait a dog will [19:20] always come out eventually it's also [19:22] recommended to cue the dog with the [19:24] leash while using leash pressure and [19:26] keeping your back to the dog basically [19:28] i'll put the leash behind my back i have [19:30] the crate right next to me and i use the [19:32] leash pressure allowing the dog to come [19:34] out this way i'm showing my back which [19:36] is way less of a threat to the dog [19:38] once the dog comes out allow them to go [19:41] back into the crate having them go in [19:42] and out of the crate will get the dog [19:43] more comfortable with this behavior also [19:45] remember that dogs learn through [19:47] predictability if the dog learns that [19:49] you're going to train the moment the dog [19:51] comes out you may find more resistance [19:54] next time the dog doesn't want to train [19:57] this next one is very rare but worth [19:59] mentioning forward fear aggression [20:02] problems [20:03] this is [20:04] more dangerous of a dog situation but a [20:08] little more workable than the dominant [20:10] aggressive dog which i'll talk about [20:11] next i dealt with a dog like this fairly [20:14] recently in 2020 a client came to me and [20:17] they needed help with an aggression [20:18] issues and they wanted me to evaluate [20:20] the dog well i discovered that this dog [20:23] was a fearful forward aggressive dog [20:25] what i mean is that the dog was [20:26] extremely proactive in neutralizing [20:28] threats with with its aggressive [20:30] behaviors however unlike dominant [20:32] aggression this was still based on fear [20:34] so while most fearful dogs growl or act [20:37] aggressive in a defensive way to avoid [20:39] the things that they're afraid of this [20:41] dog decides to take matters into their [20:42] own hands and attack the thing that [20:44] they're afraid of [20:46] when working with this dog i had my back [20:47] to her in a non-threatening way and she [20:50] still ran behind me and bit me although [20:53] once i turned around and grabbed her by [20:55] the collar she stopped as you can [20:57] imagine this is a pretty extreme and [20:59] dangerous situation for a trainer to [21:01] come across and like a dominant [21:03] aggressive dog protective gear is always [21:06] a wise idea [21:07] to train such a dog it's basically a [21:09] rehash of what we just discussed for a [21:12] normal fear-based dog but everything is [21:14] going to go slower and you're going to [21:16] have to be more methodical and generally [21:19] being much more careful or if you're new [21:21] to being a dog trainer it's okay to [21:24] refer the client to another trainer with [21:27] more experience working with aggressive [21:29] dogs in fact there are a lot of trainers [21:32] out there that specialize in working [21:34] with aggressive dogs [21:36] next is confusion-based aggressive [21:37] problems these situations are usually [21:40] the result of poor training and can [21:42] occur without the owner even realizing [21:44] that they're creating a dog with [21:45] aggressive issues [21:47] one example is a dog that was featured [21:50] by inside edition as frankie the demon [21:53] dog [21:54] as it turns out frankie wasn't a demon [21:57] dog at all she just had no idea what to [22:00] do and what not to do creating very [22:03] erratic behavior [22:05] one way a dog becomes this way is that [22:07] the timing of the obedience training is [22:09] off by even a second in this situation [22:12] frankie's owner was implementing [22:15] training but with poorly timed rewards [22:17] and corrections such as saying no too [22:20] late after frankie was calm and laying [22:21] on the couch in frankie's mind laying on [22:24] the couch and being calm was the [22:25] behavior that was wrong and frankie out [22:27] of frustration and confusion answered [22:30] with aggression [22:32] these situations are resolved by [22:33] instituting proper obedience training [22:36] and it may take some time to work out [22:38] the bad habits that were created from [22:40] the previous poor training of course in [22:42] this situation we have to make sure we [22:45] identify the type of aggression issue to [22:48] ensure it's confusion-based and not a [22:50] more dangerous situation with a [22:52] different type of aggression [22:54] the best way is to see how the owner [22:57] performs their dog training techniques [22:59] and if they're the ones creating the [23:01] confusion and the aggression i usually [23:04] ask the client to make a video of the [23:05] dog's behavior that i can study before [23:08] the training [23:11] next we're going to talk about dominant [23:13] aggression problems [23:15] as i mentioned previously [23:17] this situation or these situations are [23:20] very rare i've only encountered two [23:22] dominant aggressive dogs among the [23:24] countless dogs i've worked with since [23:26] 2012.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 289/841,these are dogs using their [23:29] aggressive behavior as a way to dominate [23:31] and control a situation dominance to a [23:34] dog also means having priority access to [23:38] valuable or limited resources [23:42] the way to deal with these situations is [23:44] you need protective gear on to block any [23:47] damage from the bites then the goal is [23:49] to simply show the dog that the [23:52] aggression is not going to work this [23:54] means not showing fear or even [23:56] responding at all to the bites you're [23:58] having to take the power away from the [24:00] dog you also want to do your best to [24:03] prevent the dog from trying to bite you [24:05] in the first place that's going to be [24:08] very important to start off with [24:10] one of the two dogs that i was working [24:13] with was a dominant aggressive husky [24:16] younger dog too only about seven or [24:18] eight months of age [24:20] when i would set something on the ground [24:21] for the dog the dog would rush towards [24:23] me and immediately try to bite or attack [24:25] me to the dog i was taking something [24:28] that he considered to be a valuable [24:30] resource even though i just set the item [24:33] down you can see how that can turn into [24:35] an issue so what i did was i set up many [24:38] different situations where the dog may [24:40] ordinarily try to bite the human but [24:43] there was a boundary set in place in [24:45] this case i set up i set an object on [24:47] the ground i put the husky on the climb [24:49] command with the leash and i back tied [24:52] the leash when i went to pick up [24:53] something off the ground which was the [24:55] trigger for this dog the dog ran at me [24:58] but was auto corrected by the leash [25:00] blocking his attempt to bite me [25:02] afterward the main goal was to repeat [25:04] this as many times as i possibly could [25:07] in different environments getting the [25:09] dog generalized and having them realize [25:11] that they're not going to be able to [25:12] bite anymore to get what they want and [25:14] the behavior started to go away [25:17] while wearing protective gear the dog is [25:18] biting you you can ignore the bite or [25:20] you can pull them into the bite until [25:22] the dog feels uncomfortable as the only [25:24] type of corrective measure i would [25:26] probably use in a situation like this [25:29] you're basically pulling their mouth [25:30] onto the protective gear until they [25:32] realize that biting sucks and they don't [25:35] want to do it anymore because it's [25:37] uncomfortable again be careful that the [25:39] dog doesn't transfer the bite to a new [25:42] location [25:43] so to quickly recap on dominant [25:46] aggressive dogs and this is just a very [25:48] brief explanation there's a lot more to [25:51] it but these can be dangerous situations [25:53] they do try to bite they want to bite [25:56] and may even get satisfaction from it so [25:58] be very careful [25:59] you must prevent them from biting in the [26:01] first place but don't correct them while [26:04] biting because this can turn into a [26:06] fight so you should have protective gear [26:08] on regardless if you don't have such [26:11] protective gear available [26:13] this is a good time to refer that client [26:15] to another dog trainer that specializes [26:18] in aggression [26:20] okay let's talk about how to deal with [26:23] dog-on-dog aggression [26:25] just like we see different forms of [26:27] aggressive behaviors towards humans the [26:30] same is true with aggression towards [26:33] other dogs you will see fear aggression [26:35] dominant aggression aggression to get a [26:38] specific result etc [26:41] generally a dog will become aggressive [26:44] to other dogs because of experiences [26:47] that they had when they're a puppy which [26:49] could be lack of socialization and other [26:51] problems during the dog's upbringing or [26:54] imprinting [26:55] in numerous situations a dog can learn [26:58] that other dogs are a threat including [27:00] being attacked another factor may be the [27:03] dog's dna and a built-in tendency to be [27:06] less friendly to other dogs in either [27:08] situation obedience can either stop or [27:12] mask the issue so even if a dog has a [27:15] compulsion to attack another dog [27:18] they'll weigh that impulse against the [27:20] thought of a reward or correction and [27:22] are less likely to be aggressive [27:24] when restricting a dog from attacking [27:26] another dog such as when you have them [27:27] on leash it's possible that the dog will [27:30] redirect the aggression towards the [27:31] human overarousal aggression too much [27:34] stimuli can become a redirected [27:38] aggression or an attempt to bite [27:40] dogs can also be dominant aggressive [27:42] towards other dogs just like they can be [27:44] to humans this is an extreme situation [27:46] and as such i never bring dominant [27:49] aggressive dogs around other dogs to try [27:51] to work the problem out i just feel like [27:53] it's not fair putting [27:55] a non-aggressive dog in the vicinity of [27:57] a dog that wants to attack them simply [27:59] out of dominant bully-type behaviors [28:02] another way to go about this is keeping [28:04] the dog muzzled on a leash and then [28:06] exposing the dog to many other dogs in [28:09] the area like outside of a dog park as [28:11] mentioned in some of my other videos you [28:13] can keep the dog outside of the park [28:15] like along the fence and out of actual [28:18] contact with other dogs while doing [28:20] obedience over time and it may take a [28:22] long time the dog may learn to stop [28:25] trying to intimidate other dogs these [28:27] are the concepts of desensitization and [28:29] a bit of counter [28:31] conditioning at work [28:33] if you do encounter another dog in the [28:34] vicinity of the dominant aggressive dog [28:37] make sure you have full control if the [28:39] dog escapes your leash and especially [28:42] the dog isn't muzzled in a few seconds [28:44] another dog could be in a [28:46] life-threatening situation [28:48] dogs may also become fearful of other [28:50] dogs because of things like trauma [28:52] genetics lack of exposure etc they may [28:54] have had issues when they were a puppy [28:57] incidences that involved other dogs or [28:59] the puppy could have been raised with a [29:00] very fearful mom the reason fear stems [29:03] from the mother is because dogs will [29:05] often replicate the behavior they see [29:07] displayed by the mother this behavior is [29:09] identified when the dog cowers or [29:11] whimpers when other dogs are around or [29:13] when other dogs intrude too closely the [29:15] dog may get defensive growl bark hackles [29:18] could go up or even snap [29:20] usually they don't want to hurt the [29:21] other dog they just want the other dog [29:23] to go away their message is i'm afraid [29:24] of you i don't want to play please go [29:27] away these types of dogs can be fixed if [29:29] you bring them around very friendly nice [29:31] dogs i've worked the situation out many [29:34] times before by introducing dogs that [29:36] had these types of behaviors and issues [29:39] to very friendly dogs in a play [29:40] situation at first they would cower and [29:43] whimper and run away from the other dogs [29:44] but over time the dogs start to realize [29:46] that these other dogs were not a threat [29:49] and as they discovered this and were [29:50] given positive experiences it often [29:53] stopped the fear issues that the dog was [29:55] having this type of aggressive behavior [29:57] can be identified by their signs of [29:59] actual fear and cowering so make sure [30:01] you properly identify this type of fear [30:04] that your dog has because as we [30:06] mentioned earlier a dominant aggressive [30:08] dog you do not want to put with a group [30:11] of other dogs because that could turn [30:12] into a very bad and dangerous situation [30:15] often dogs will also act aggressively to [30:18] get something from another dog most [30:20] people when [30:21] in this will call the dog the alpha the [30:23] reason is that the dog will often take [30:25] what they want from a more submissive [30:27] dog for example one dog has a toy and [30:30] the other dog the alpha takes that toy [30:32] from the other dog they'll also take [30:34] things like food away from a more [30:36] submissive dog or someone's attention [30:38] the easiest way to deal with this is to [30:40] just keep toys and food limited to just [30:43] one dog at a time or while one dog's [30:45] playing at a time you may also want to [30:47] feed the dogs in separate rooms or in [30:49] their crates [30:50] this usually won't turn into a dogfight [30:52] because the more submissive dog will [30:54] yield to the more dominant dog if i want [30:56] to stop something like this then i [30:58] prefer to prevent the dog from stealing [31:00] or being a bully to the other dog by [31:02] preventing the dog from practicing a [31:04] behavior just like anything else it will [31:06] often go away however the best course of [31:09] action is to simply not leave out [31:11] anything that the dominant dog sees is [31:13] valuable you can try to teach the dog [31:15] that it's not okay of a behavior by [31:18] implementing obedience but i would [31:20] prefer not to put any other dog in a [31:23] potential dangerous situation [31:26] follow these three simple steps [31:28] put away all toys that the dog may fight [31:31] over and only allow them to play with [31:33] toys when they are not around the other [31:35] dogs [31:36] during feeding time feed the dogs in [31:38] separate crates or separate rooms teach [31:41] both dogs their own separate climb [31:43] command such as their own bed and don't [31:46] allow them to ever go to the other dog's [31:48] bed ever [31:50] this way the submissive dog when feeling [31:52] threatened he or she can go to their [31:55] safe place when it comes to aggression [31:57] this is only scratching the surface if [31:59] you want to learn more about dog [32:00] aggression i would highly recommend [32:03] working with a dog trainer that [32:05] specializes in this type of training [32:07] since it can be very dangerous it's best [32:10] to learn hands-on with an expert [32:14] i hope everyone enjoyed today's video [32:17] let me know what you think about it in [32:18] the comments below if you want [32:20] one-on-one help i do offer in-person [32:23]

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 292/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today i want to talk to you about the [00:01] importance of canine nutrition why is it [00:04] important to feed your pet high quality [00:06] food without a doubt providing quality [00:08] food for your canine family member is a [00:10] definite way any pet owner can help [00:12] improve their dog's longevity and [00:14] quality of life something as simple as [00:16] following proper nutrition guidelines [00:18] can result in fewer skin conditions [00:21] less itching fewer ear infections [00:24] shinier coats better muscle tone [00:26] stronger bones more energy better [00:28] temperament and even immediate and [00:30] noticeable physical benefits in the end [00:33] your pup will feel better overall and be [00:35] happier [00:36] since i've been a professional dog [00:38] trainer i'm often asked what should i [00:40] feed my dog or what's the best choice [00:42] for training treats or snacks that i can [00:45] give my dog an excellent source of [00:47] information that i often rely on comes [00:49] from the holistic canine nutritionist dr [00:52] karen becker she has a youtube channel [00:54] website and a book that is an excellent [00:56] resource when it comes to canine [00:58] nutrition according to dr becker when [01:01] looking for quality and nutritious dog [01:04] food the first and most important step [01:06] is to make sure you know where the pet [01:07] food is coming from and where it is made [01:10] it's really unfortunate that pet food [01:12] quality control testing is not an [01:14] industry standard but the good news is [01:17] that ethical pet food companies [01:18] voluntarily choose to test their food dr [01:22] becker strongly encourages getting your [01:23] pets food from a company that has [01:25] quality control protocols in place such [01:27] as batch testing to ensure the food is [01:30] pathogen free taking these first couple [01:32] of steps can help assure that you are [01:35] not only feeding your pet something [01:36] healthy but you are also ensuring the [01:39] food itself is safe dr karen becker also [01:42] highlights foods for specific stages of [01:45] life pet foods are formulated as either [01:47] all eye stages or individual life stages [01:50] when you purchase food for all life [01:51] stages it's not tailored to a specific [01:54] stage of life [01:55] however a dog's life is not one size [01:58] fits all dogs require specific nutrients [02:00] for different stages of life for a puppy [02:03] you may want to seek out food formulated [02:05] for growth and then you want to seek out [02:07] food formulated for maintenance when [02:09] looking at adult dogs [02:11] next i want to discuss a dog's natural [02:13] diet meaning [02:15] what would a dog or its ancestor the [02:17] gray wolf eat in the wild i'm telling [02:20] you right now you're not going to find [02:21] potatoes grains or corn in a dog's [02:23] natural diet some pet food companies use [02:26] these types of ingredients not because [02:27] they are nutritious but because they are [02:29] cheap fillers let's take a look at a [02:31] couple of the ingredients list from [02:33] common store-bought dog food [02:35] as you can see [02:36] there are entirely way too many [02:38] carbohydrates and other highly processed [02:40] ingredients dr becker recommends only [02:43] feeding foods that are biologically [02:45] appropriate natural and without fillers [02:47] really what it comes down to is the more [02:49] ingredients that come from whole and [02:51] fresh foods means the less to no [02:53] synthetic vitamins being added to your [02:56] pet's food [02:57] i want to highlight one more aspect of [02:59] canine nutrition and that is the [03:01] tendency for pet owners to feed too much [03:04] food more often than not this is due to [03:06] the lack of knowledge of proper feeding [03:08] requirements it's no wonder that pet [03:10] obesity is on the rise and some pet food [03:12] companies are not helping by [03:14] intentionally recommending too much food [03:17] if you think about it the more food your [03:19] dog consumes the more you'll need to buy [03:21] and the more a company can profit if you [03:24] have a 15 pound dog that spends the [03:26] majority of their time laying down with [03:29] little interest to exercise you can [03:31] easily overfeed them when following the [03:33] standard feeding guidelines found on [03:35] most labels alternatively an active dog [03:38] who zips around or spends the day [03:40] working will need more calories than the [03:42] couch potato and might not be receiving [03:45] the correct amount of food when [03:46] following the standard feeding [03:47] guidelines so how much should you be [03:50] feeding your pet and when [03:52] ethical food companies tend to have [03:54] detailed feeding instructions and [03:56] sometimes will even feature a meal [03:58] calculator on their website these [04:00] calculators allow you to input your [04:01] dog's age ideal weight activity level [04:04] and how many calories per serving are in [04:07] the food you are feeding your dog [04:09] using a calculator and monitoring your [04:12] dog's weight to find the perfect amount [04:14] of food for your dog will produce a more [04:16] favorable outcome than blindly following [04:19] oftentimes very confusing dog food [04:21] labels [04:22] what i do and recommend others do is [04:25] weigh your dog's food this way you know [04:27] exactly how much you're feeding your dog [04:29] and if you need to adjust it becomes [04:31] very simple and straightforward if [04:34] you're training your dog and using meal [04:35] time for training time but you also want [04:38] to add treats or snacks then weigh your [04:40] dog's food daily [04:42] in the morning so your entire dog's [04:44] daily intake wait in the morning and [04:46] grab from that throughout the day when [04:48] you run out you know that your dog has [04:50] consumed all their food for that day [04:52] this is especially helpful if multiple [04:54] people are feeding or training the dog [04:57] because it will help prevent [04:58] accidentally over feeding [05:01] now that we've gone over what the wrong [05:02] thing to feed your dog let's talk about [05:04] what you should be looking for when it [05:06] comes to feeding your pet dr becker [05:08] recommends a biologically correct diet [05:10] for a carnivore which is high moisture [05:13] high protein [05:14] healthy fats and low carbohydrates the [05:17] best diet is a balanced unprocessed and [05:20] species appropriate diet and one that [05:22] dogs are designed to eat in the wild [05:24] dr becker lists a raw diet as the [05:26] optimal diet for a dog in general a raw [05:29] diet is what a dog was designed to eat [05:32] dogs are some of the most resilient [05:33] animals and have been able to survive [05:35] being fed foods they were never designed [05:37] to eat unfortunately surviving does not [05:41] necessarily equal thriving the pet food [05:43] that you buy from the store has only [05:45] been around for a little bit more than [05:47] 100 years animals such as dogs and their [05:49] ancestors have been eating whole animals [05:52] for millions of years that means for [05:54] 99.

in simple order from worst to best [08:10] just based on the type of food the order [08:13] would be kibble then canned then [08:15] dehydrated [08:16] like the company's honest kitchen or [08:18] sojos then freeze dried and then raw [08:22] raw is what i feed my dogs ari and [08:24] charlie and what i recommend to my [08:25] clients i can personally attest to the [08:27] benefits of a raw diet from the dramatic [08:29] drop in the amount of shedding more [08:32] regular bowel movements shinier coats [08:34] overall muscle definition and fitness as [08:37] well as improved dental health speaking [08:40] of dental health since this is commonly [08:42] asked i'll quickly break down what i [08:44] provide my dogs to help maintain healthy [08:47] gums and canines [08:50] one as you already know and what i've [08:51] already mentioned is i feed my dogs a [08:53] raw diet two about every three days or [08:56] so i give my dogs a yummy comb these are [08:59] treats that have been designed to floss [09:01] our dog's teeth all the way to the gum [09:03] line the treats honeycomb holes are [09:06] designed to surround the dog's teeth [09:08] while the higher outer edges are [09:11] supposed to massage your dog's gums and [09:13] then scrape the plaque around and [09:15] between the teeth [09:16] three once a week i give my dogs a raw [09:19] bone with grass-fed raw beef and bone [09:21] marrow raw bones like this work to [09:23] scrape away plaque and tartar [09:25] just be sure to take the bone away when [09:27] all the meat has been consumed the [09:29] reason for this is that some dogs will [09:31] grind their canines on the raw bone [09:34] which can start to wear them down four [09:36] it's also good practice to brush your [09:39] dog's teeth weekly or even daily and [09:42] lastly every six months or so i take my [09:44] dogs to get non-anesthetic ultrasonic [09:47] dental cleaning this is usually enough [09:50] to keep my dog's canines and gums [09:52] healthy and clean [09:54] now what about training and using treats [09:56] or food to motivate the dog that you're [09:58] working with well if you're still doing [10:01] continual reinforcement meaning you're [10:03] still rewarding every correct behavior [10:05] and money is no object then i would [10:08] suggest using freeze-dried dog food it [10:10] provides most of the nutrients that a [10:13] full raw diet does but it's much easier [10:15] to handle for training than raw would be [10:18] if money is an object then i would [10:19] recommend using something like stella [10:21] and chewie's freeze-dried coated kibble [10:23] it's still kibble but it's a higher [10:25] quality and it's great for training and [10:28] since we're on the subject it's [10:29] important to mention that each dog in [10:31] training should be in one of three [10:33] stages for each command first stage is [10:36] when the dog still needs the physical [10:38] cue to complete the behavior basically [10:39] the dog is still not able to do the [10:41] behavior on the command alone if you're [10:43] on this stage then you're still on [10:46] continual reinforcement the next stage [10:48] is when your dog is able to do the [10:50] behavior on the command alone when you [10:52] first enter this stage you'll do one of [10:54] two things when your dog does the [10:56] commanded behavior either you'll still [10:58] mark in reward or you'll give your dog [11:00] verbal praise such as good boy nice job [11:03] after doing this for a few weeks you'll [11:05] move on to the final stage of rewards [11:07] for each correct behavior you'll do one [11:09] of three options either you'll mark in [11:11] reward you'll give verbal praise or you [11:13] won't say anything at all no reward this [11:16] is the goal for each command that your [11:18] dog can perform the requested commands [11:20] but doesn't always need to be rewarded [11:23] for each correct repetition now i [11:26] understand that for some a raw diet is [11:28] not always affordable if you can't [11:29] afford to feed an all-fresh raw diet you [11:32] can offer fresh food snacks if you feed [11:34] your dog 14 times in a week try making [11:36] two to four unprocessed meals or [11:38] whatever you can afford maybe you can't [11:40] afford a completely balanced diet for [11:43] every meal but you can provide some [11:45] fresh food as snacks that's okay too [11:48] just like us humans some fresh food is [11:50] better than no fresh food the best thing [11:52] you can do is work towards providing the [11:54] best food you can afford to feed your [11:56] pet and on a final note what about human [11:59] food often i'll hear people say proudly [12:02] i never give my dog human food now this [12:05] is great if their definition of human [12:07] food is fast food however there is [12:10] nothing wrong with giving your dog [12:12] natural raw foods from the grocery store [12:14] often when i'm cooking i'll give my dog [12:16] small bites from the raw ingredients and [12:18] if i'm unsure of a certain ingredient a [12:21] quick google search will often let me [12:23] know if it's okay or if it's not okay to [12:25] feed my dog just like with anything the [12:28] key word is moderation for a little bit [12:30] of perspective the longest living dog [12:32] was an australian kelpie named maggie [12:34] that lived 30 years the owner said that [12:37] he fed her primarily a raw diet [12:39] including raw goat milk and that she [12:41] would get plenty of daily exercise on [12:43] his farm [12:45] so this may be a good method to follow [12:46] if you want your dog to live the longest [12:49] and healthiest life possible [12:51] i hope everyone enjoyed today's video as [12:53] always let me know what you think about [12:54] it in the comments below if you want [12:56] one-on-one help i do offer in-person [12:59] lessons as well as zoom training [13:01] sessions [13:02] if

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 298/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] now that we've gone over a lot of the [00:01] instructional portion of this series [00:03] becoming a professional dog trainer [00:05] we'll start working on more of the [00:07] hands-on part first it's essential to [00:10] have a training plan this will help keep [00:11] you focused and on track [00:14] before you become a professional dog [00:15] trainer it's good to have not only the [00:17] knowledge but also a significant amount [00:20] of practice you'll be able to accomplish [00:22] this by having specific training goals [00:24] for your personal dog or dogs as well as [00:27] practicing on other dogs outside of your [00:30] home you can get additional dogs to [00:32] train by reaching out to local rescue [00:34] groups or even some shelters will let [00:36] you train their dogs lastly you can even [00:38] make a post on something like next door [00:40] or just ask your family and friends and [00:42] offer free training in exchange for [00:45] feedback or even a review it's important [00:48] to let them know that you're on the [00:49] journey of becoming a professional dog [00:51] trainer so with that in mind i would [00:53] suggest going for the easy dogs first [00:56] the ones that don't have any fear or [00:58] aggression issues [01:00] as you get more experience and you [01:02] become more confident you can start [01:04] taking on some of the more challenging [01:05] cases now for your personal dogs we're [01:08] going to work on multiple goals or [01:11] obedience routines many of these goals [01:13] are the same requirements that tom rose [01:16] has for his students at the tom rose [01:18] school for professional dog trainers i'm [01:20] calling them goals because i don't offer [01:22] any kind of certification so for us they [01:25] are not requirements but rather goals [01:28] that we'll be working towards if you are [01:30] interested in getting certified as a [01:32] professional dog trainer you'd want to [01:33] check out a school like the tom rose [01:35] school the first is going to be a stick [01:38] jump it sounds simple but it can be way [01:40] more challenging than you may expect it [01:43] really depends on the dog this will be a [01:45] tool that we'll be using in the future [01:47] to help teach our dogs the broad jump in [01:49] the akc obedience routine whenever you [01:52] have a chance go to your local hardware [01:54] store and pick up a four foot or so pvc [01:57] pipe we'll also be teaching our dogs two [01:59] basic pet tricks this can be anything [02:01] that would be considered a trick such as [02:04] play dead spin weave bow over under roll [02:07] over sit pretty stand on your hind legs [02:10] wave or any other cute trick that you [02:12] can come up with the purpose of this [02:14] goal is to learn how to problem solve as [02:16] well as implementing the science of dog [02:18] training [02:19] we also have a few obedience routines [02:21] we're going to be working on in this [02:22] series the cgc which is the canine good [02:25] citizen the akc novice and open routine [02:29] and the igp1 obedience routine for most [02:33] of these requirements you'll need a [02:34] focused heel so with that being said i [02:37] would suggest starting on my 10 [02:39] fundamental steps for a focused heel i [02:42] would also recommend working on the [02:43] finishes as well as solidifying the heel [02:46] position i'll add links to each of these [02:48] in the description of this video [02:51] now let's go back to the dogs we'll be [02:53] training outside of our homes this is [02:55] what most dog training businesses would [02:58] call doggy boot camp [03:00] board and train stay and train or in [03:02] kennel training i'm going to explain in [03:05] this video the process that i follow [03:07] when doing a strength staying trained [03:09] this process would also be similar to [03:11] day training day training is when the [03:13] owner drops their dog off in the morning [03:15] and picks them up in the evening [03:17] first thing that i like to do is work on [03:19] bonding and building a strong [03:21] relationship based on trust [03:23] for most dogs this process is pretty [03:26] easy and straightforward we hang out [03:28] with them we pet the dog we play fetch [03:30] or tug if that's something the dog likes [03:32] once i can tell the dog is comfortable [03:34] in their new environment that's when [03:36] i'll start the training the first thing [03:38] i do with any dog that i train is [03:40] engagement training this helps us teach [03:43] the dog a few things one it teaches the [03:45] dog that if they pay attention to us [03:47] good things will happen it also helps us [03:49] teach the dog our conditioned [03:51] reinforcers or our markers when done [03:54] correctly most dogs can become [03:55] conditioned within the first day or so [03:57] after that i can move on to the other [03:59] important steps that help us establish [04:01] our communication channels with the dog [04:03] basically the first three steps are all [04:06] about our communication now just note at [04:09] the start of every session that i do [04:11] with a dog i spend 30 seconds or so on [04:14] engagement training the reason for this [04:16] is that it gets the dog engaged and the [04:18] more focus we have from our dogs while [04:20] we're training the faster they'll learn [04:23] once the dog is conditioned i'll start [04:25] working on teaching the dog luring this [04:28] is when we use food to lure the dog into [04:31] the different commanded behaviors for [04:33] all my bored and trained dogs aside from [04:35] teaching them their markers i teach them [04:37] sit down come heal or loose leash [04:40] walking climb or go to bed off spin that [04:43] one's for fun and stay in all the [04:46] commanded positions all of these can be [04:48] taught by using a lure this is one of [04:50] the most powerful tools we can use to [04:52] train dogs depending on the dog's food [04:55] motivation and interest in training will [04:57] depend on how long the step takes you [04:59] want to make sure that it's pretty solid [05:01] as it will help us teach the dog leash [05:03] pressure which is our next step if [05:06] you've been following my channel then [05:07] you should know how powerful leash [05:09] pressure training is when we use leash [05:12] pressure we're using negative [05:13] reinforcement we turn the pressure on [05:15] and when the dog complies we turn it off [05:18] i use leash pressure to help reinforce [05:20] commands i use it to teach all the stay [05:22] commands i use it to establish [05:24] boundaries such as not going into the [05:26] street or jumping up on furniture [05:29] look at it this way anytime we're [05:31] teaching our dogs something we're in a [05:34] sense [05:35] asking them a question or we're [05:37] presenting a problem for example when we [05:39] ask a dog to sit [05:41] we're saying do you know what to do when [05:43] i tell you to sit and the dog gives us a [05:45] blank look basically saying no i don't [05:48] know what to do when you say sit so we [05:50] then give them the answer by luring them [05:53] into the sit [05:54] just like you can't ask another human a [05:57] question and give them the answer at the [05:58] exact same time you don't want to give [06:01] the question an answer to your dog at [06:03] the exact same time meaning you don't [06:05] want to say sit at the exact moment you [06:08] lure the dog into the sit position this [06:10] would be known as overshadowing when two [06:12] things are presented to a dog at the [06:14] exact same time whatever is more [06:16] relevant to the dog is what they focus [06:18] on and they completely ignored the other [06:20] element i'm mentioning this because it's [06:23] the same when we teach our dogs leash [06:25] pressure [06:27] what should really be called a leash cue [06:29] because we're cueing the dog into [06:31] different positions this should not be [06:34] seen as force unless you have a dog that [06:36] is so wild and unruly that you don't [06:38] have any choice but to apply force which [06:41] you will come across if you train enough [06:43] dogs [06:44] for each dog in basic obedience training [06:47] i want them to be able to follow the [06:48] leash [06:49] sit when lifting up on the leash and lay [06:52] down when pulling down on the leash for [06:54] your personal dogs you also want to be [06:56] able to teach them to walk backwards [06:58] with leash pressure when teaching this [07:00] it makes it much easier if the dog [07:03] already knows how to get into each [07:05] position with a lure this helps us [07:08] provide the answer for them when we give [07:10] them the question with the leash [07:11] pressure what i mean by that is well for [07:14] example when we pull up on the leash [07:16] we're saying do you know what to do when [07:18] i pull up on the leash and the dog gives [07:20] us a blank look and says no i don't know [07:22] what to do when you pull up on the leash [07:24] so we then give them the answer by [07:26] luring them into the sit [07:28] this is how we teach the dog leash [07:30] pressure we present the pressure then we [07:33] cue the dog with the food into the [07:35] commanded position [07:37] once this step is accomplished i start [07:39] teaching the dog commands as well as the [07:42] stays [07:43] i try to get in two sessions each day [07:46] with each dog one at the house and one [07:49] while i'm on a walk when i'm at the [07:50] house i'm working on everything but heel [07:53] when i take them on a walk i work on [07:55] loose leash walking sits automatic sits [07:58] when halted down sit in motion down in [08:01] motion and come when called during this [08:04] time i'm also not allowing them to [08:06] practice any bad behavior such as [08:08] barking at strangers jumping up on [08:10] people or taking treats with too much [08:13] force [08:14] speaking of treats make sure the owner [08:16] provides the dog's food the last thing [08:18] you want is for a dog you're training to [08:21] have the runs now depending on the owner [08:23] will depend on if i'm using corrections [08:26] positive punishment and if i'm doing off [08:28] leash training if they want off leash [08:30] training then we'll have to use a remote [08:32] training collar [08:34] then we continue to work with the dog [08:35] every day getting as many repetitions in [08:38] as possible as tom rose says repeat [08:41] repeat repeat nothing helps a dog [08:44] succeed like constant repetition of [08:47] training exercises i also work on [08:49] proofing meaning i start working with [08:51] the dog in new environments with [08:53] different distractions simply choosing [08:55] different routes during my walking [08:57] sessions can help me accomplish this [09:00] lastly when the dog goes home i provide [09:02] my clients with a free copy of my dog [09:05] training manual as well as a go home [09:07] lesson where i break down everything [09:08] i've done with their dogs basically i [09:11] have them go over each step that i teach [09:13] in chapter seven of my dog training [09:15] manual [09:16] now you don't have to provide your [09:18] clients with a manual but it's good to [09:20] write out each step for them in an easy [09:22] to understand format this provides them [09:25] with a reference so they know exactly [09:28] what to do even if you're not there to [09:30] tell them i want to give you an idea of [09:32] what a finished stay and trained dog [09:34] should look like these were accomplished [09:37] in a two or three week stay in train [09:39] program they're dogs that i trained back [09:41] in 2015 when i was training dogs in [09:43] colorado [09:44] to promote my training what i used to do [09:46] was i would make videos for each dog [09:49] that would go through my stay and train [09:51] program [09:59] [Music] [10:27] [Music] [10:41] [Music] [10:56] [Music] [11:21] [Music] [11:33] [Music] [11:39] [Music] [12:11] [Music] [12:38] [Music] [12:44] i hope everyone enjoyed today's video as [12:47] always

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 301/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] competition obedience is a great way to [00:01] sharpen your skills as a professional [00:03] dog trainer you don't have to compete [00:05] but it is good to practice working on [00:07] precision type obedience of course you [00:10] can always compete if you want to see [00:12] how you and your dog would do up against [00:14] other competitive dog training teams [00:16] which many are professional dog trainers [00:19] with exceptional skills [00:20] if you can get good at competition [00:22] obedience it will make pet obedience [00:25] seem significantly easier [00:27] today we'll be teaching our dogs the [00:29] stick jump this is a fun simple [00:31] straightforward command that we can [00:32] later use to help teach the broad jump [00:35] for the akc obedience competitive [00:37] routine the goal is to have your dog [00:39] jump over a stick that you're holding in [00:41] your hand we're going to break the [00:43] training down into five steps [00:46] speaking of if you and your dog are an [00:48] active team then i would suggest [00:51] considering pet insurance actually even [00:53] the couch potatoes should be covered as [00:56] well if you've been thinking about pet [00:58] insurance but haven't decided on a [00:59] company then prudent pet insurance may [01:02] be for you they're the ultimate option [01:04] to make sure your four-legged family [01:07] member is covered and protected their [01:09] pet insurance plans cover a variety of [01:11] needs for your pet with tons of [01:13] customizable options they have a 30 day [01:16] money back guaranteed their number one [01:18] rated pet insurance on trustpilot they [01:20] have a 24 7 veterinarian chat and if you [01:23] sign up through the link in the [01:24] description you'll get five percent off [01:26] first you want to make sure your dog [01:28] knows a climb command or a place command [01:30] this is going to help teach your dog [01:32] where you want them to go when they make [01:34] the jump or when they are waiting to [01:36] jump next we'll teach our dogs the act [01:38] of jumping we'll start low and gradually [01:41] increase the height as the dog starts to [01:43] understand the concept to minimize [01:45] mistakes will have a lower pull that [01:47] will prevent the dog from trying to go [01:49] under the pole that you're holding if [01:51] you have extra space then it would be [01:53] worthwhile to set up a jump shoot as [01:55] demonstrated by the tom rose school in a [01:58] past video on this channel [02:00] once the dog knows how to jump then we [02:02] can start teaching the command if the [02:04] dog likes to jump which many do they'll [02:06] jump the moment you say the command even [02:09] though it may seem like they know the [02:10] command many will jump out of the [02:12] excitement or just from being released [02:14] from the climb or place day just make [02:17] sure that you do this step as many times [02:19] as it takes [02:20] now that the dog can jump we'll start [02:22] throwing a toy as the dog is jumping [02:24] this will teach the dog to jump straight [02:26] which will prevent the dog from jumping [02:28] closer to the handler this is keeping [02:30] reward placement in mind for example if [02:32] we reward the dog with the treat when [02:34] they jump then they may jump very close [02:37] to us anticipating the reward this is [02:39] why it's better to throw a toy however [02:41] you can also have the dog go to the [02:43] other climb or place command and reward [02:45] them there with the food after they jump [02:48] last we'll start holding the pole when [02:50] the dog jumps gradually increasing the [02:52] height and eventually removing the [02:54] bottom bar and the jumps all together [02:57] let's go ahead and get started first [03:00] thing you want to do is get your [03:01] training area set up so you can see i [03:03] have the jump in the center and on each [03:05] side i have a bowl so i'm going to be [03:07] using the place command you could also [03:09] use the climb command a platform that [03:11] you have on each side this is going to [03:13] give the dog a target to go to when they [03:15] jump and it's going to make it much [03:17] easier as we're training our dogs now if [03:20] you want you can do what the tom rose [03:22] school does and set up a jump chute [03:24] that's going to help teach the dog how [03:26] to jump but we're just using some basic [03:28] pvc pipes for today now i'm not all the [03:30] way up against the fence but [03:32] if you have a wall that you could train [03:34] up against it will help prevent the dog [03:36] from trying to go around the jump which [03:38] we don't want them to do we want to make [03:39] sure they do the jump so what i'm going [03:42] to do is i'm going to take ari and i'm [03:44] going to place her on her bowl ari place [03:47] so now she's on her bowl and this is [03:49] going to be a nice area for her to head [03:51] to after she does each jump now [03:54] the way that i like to teach a dog at [03:56] first when they're jumping is i make [03:57] sure that the jump is very low and then [04:00] i will go over the jump and call the dog [04:03] to me so i'll stand nice and close if i [04:05] need to call the dog and back off you [04:07] could also run and jump it and call your [04:09] dog with a very excited voice something [04:12] that you might do with a puppy but since [04:14] she's pretty well trained and a lot of [04:16] your dogs will probably be pretty well [04:17] trained as well this should be an easy [04:20] process so we call her dog all right [04:21] come here baby [04:22] good girl she makes the jump and goes [04:25] right to her other place bowl [04:28] and again we go back over come on ari [04:31] good and they follow us [04:33] and they'll do the jump same way we do [04:36] alternatively the other option like i [04:38] said if you have a puppy or a dog that [04:40] may not be as obedient as ari then you [04:42] can run and call them to you so you can [04:44] go come on let's go let's go good girl [04:47] and they'll run and do the jump with you [04:50] when i start having the dog jump now [04:52] once we know we can get the dog to do [04:55] the jump without it being in our hand [04:57] now we can start adding a command since [05:00] i'm going to be holding the jump [05:03] pretty much right here when she goes and [05:05] makes the jump i want to get her used to [05:07] seeing my body in the same position it's [05:10] going to be close to when we do the jump [05:13] so i'm going to stand right here i'm [05:14] going to tell her to do the command [05:16] and then i'm going to move with her to [05:18] encourage her to continue going forward [05:20] and not turning around back towards me [05:24] if we reward our dog when they do the [05:26] jump and we reward them right next to us [05:28] what ends up happening is the dog will [05:30] jump but they'll jump very close to us [05:33] we want to make them jump as straight as [05:35] possible so this is going to help with [05:36] that so i'm going to tell her jump and [05:38] then i'm going to run with her all the [05:40] way to [05:41] the climb platform and then i'm going to [05:42] give her a couple treats [05:44] please [05:46] and then i'm going to do the same thing [05:48] on the other side [05:49] jump [05:50] good girl and i run with her to the [05:54] place bowl again teaching her that when [05:56] she makes the jump that she doesn't just [05:58] come on ari [06:00] place [06:02] that she doesn't just [06:03] turn right directly to me but she has a [06:06] target or a location that she's headed [06:08] to again the climb command works really [06:10] well for this so we want to continue [06:13] doing this as many times as it takes to [06:15] where we can just stand here and give [06:17] our dog the command and they'll do the [06:19] jump [06:20] once she completes the jump i have two [06:23] different options at least these are the [06:25] two different options that i like to do [06:26] either a [06:28] i'll go over and i'll give her a reward [06:29] on the place bowl like i have been doing [06:31] or b i'll throw a toy so i'm going to [06:34] demonstrate both of them and i like to [06:36] move after she's already committed to [06:38] the jump [06:40] jump [06:42] and then i'll go with her to the place [06:44] bowl and give her some treats now the [06:46] other option is we take a toy [06:50] when we throw the toy we want to throw [06:52] it [06:53] on an angle [06:54] away from us not close to us and same [06:57] thing when she commits to the jump [06:59] that's when i'm going to throw the toy [07:00] then i'm going to play with her for a [07:02] second so again we stand in the same [07:04] position and we tell our dog [07:06] jump [07:08] and then we throw the toy good girl very [07:10] nice [07:12] she comes over [07:13] we play a little bit of tug oh god and [07:17] then i tell her place [07:19] out [07:21] and then i can take the toy back [07:24] once your dog is pretty confident with [07:26] this portion of the training then we can [07:28] increase the height i like to increase [07:30] the height before i ask the dog to do [07:32] the jump when i'm just holding the stick [07:34] so what we're going to do is we're going [07:36] to take it and we're going to increase [07:37] the height but i'm going to leave the [07:39] bottom bar especially in the beginning [07:42] because i want to prevent her from [07:45] trying to go underneath we don't want [07:48] our dogs to go underneath if you [07:50] increase the height too quickly and you [07:52] don't have a bar underneath it's quite [07:54] possible your dog will just go directly [07:56] underneath the bar so same thing [07:59] first time since it's at the beginning [08:01] i'm going to jump over it then i'm going [08:03] to call her to me or again i could just [08:05] walk over [08:07] and call her come on [08:09] very good [08:10] place [08:11] so we're basically doing the same thing [08:13] that we did before [08:14] showing our dog that they can go over [08:16] come on hurry [08:17] yeah nice job please [08:22] so now we're gonna go back to where we [08:24] stand next to the jump we give our dog [08:27] the command when they commit we run with [08:29] them to the place bowl [08:31] all right jump [08:32] good [08:34] very good [08:35] now on the next one i'm going to [08:37] demonstrate using the toy same thing [08:40] when our dog commits [08:43] we throw the toy we don't want to throw [08:45] the toy if the dog ends up going around [08:47] because then we would be rewarding them [08:49] for the wrong behavior [08:51] i jump [08:53] very good [08:55] good job ari so now we're going to do a [08:57] little bit of play [08:59] very good [09:00] what ari out center [09:04] excellent [09:05] place [09:07] out thank you dear [09:10] now that we have that the next step and [09:12] again do a lot of reps with each one of [09:15] these you want to make sure your dog [09:16] fully understands it so i've been [09:18] working on this before with her i did a [09:20] little bit more yesterday as a refresher [09:23] but we want to make sure that we spend a [09:25] good amount of time on each step don't [09:27] rush the process [09:28] now what we're going to do is [09:30] we're going to remove the top bar [09:35] and now we're going to start holding the [09:37] bar [09:38] so what i'm going to do here is i'm [09:39] going to hold it about at the same [09:41] position that the top bar was in [09:43] when she jumps it i'm just going to set [09:46] it down and i'm going to go reward her [09:47] at the place bowl the same way i was [09:49] doing it earlier [09:51] all right jump [09:53] good girl very nice a little bit of [09:56] praise if you want you can use a marker [09:59] i'm just using verbal praise and taking [10:01] my time with it she understands it [10:03] pretty well so whatever you want to do [10:04] with your own dog so as the dog jumps we [10:07] could mark i'll give you an example [10:11] all right jump [10:12] three [10:14] so right there i said free as she did [10:16] the jump which for the dogs that i train [10:19] place [10:21] that's their terminal marker which means [10:22] release and reward [10:25] after you've done a handful of those [10:27] then we can remove the bottom bar we [10:29] want to keep the two vertical bars in [10:31] place [10:32] and then we're gonna take the bar that [10:34] we're using for the jump when i first do [10:36] it i'm gonna keep it low [10:39] to prevent my dog from going underneath [10:42] all right jump [10:43] good girl and i'm going to walk with her [10:46] again to the place bowl you can see how [10:47] she's starting to turn a little bit [10:49] as she makes the jump because she wants [10:51] to get the reward from me but again our [10:53] dogs learn through predictability and [10:55] pattern recognition if she knows every [10:57] time she makes the jump i give her the [10:59] reward either in place over by the bowl [11:01] or i throw the toy then she'll stop [11:04] thinking of coming towards me after she [11:06] does the jump [11:08] now [11:10] when i first start having the dog jump [11:12] and i have the bar a little bit higher [11:15] after i say [11:16] the command i lower the bar a little bit [11:19] so i keep it up and then i lower it [11:21] the reason why i do that is so the dog [11:23] thinks that there's a possibility i'm [11:25] going to lower the bar which will in a [11:28] sense help prevent the dog from going [11:30] underneath [11:32] all right jump [11:33] very good ari [11:36] excellent [11:37] so she's doing really well [11:40] after we've done this for a little bit [11:41] of time then we can remove [11:45] the outside bar [11:47] you could put it next to it like i'm [11:48] doing right there or you can take it out [11:50] of the training area completely [11:52] and now i'm going to stand here [11:54] same thing i'm going to hold the bar low [11:56] and i'm going to tell her to jump [11:59] good girl she jumps she's turning a [12:02] little bit and coming towards me so [12:04] with that being said [12:05] with her i'd probably do a little bit [12:07] more of throwing the toy i'm not going [12:09] to throw the toy because that takes [12:11] extra time right now for instructional [12:13] purposes i'm going to be using mostly [12:15] food but for your own dog if you start [12:18] to see that turn like she's starting to [12:19] do then you'd want to use more toys for [12:22] the training and less treats [12:25] all right so now i'm going to increase [12:26] the height a little bit [12:28] all right jump [12:30] good girl very nice [12:33] excellent [12:34] again i'm just using verbal praise [12:36] now when we feel like all right go place [12:38] please [12:41] now that i feel like she's doing pretty [12:42] well i'm going to remove [12:46] the two vertical bars [12:48] i'm going to take them out of the shot [12:50] and now i'm going to stand in the same [12:51] spot [12:52] i'm going to keep the two bowls on each [12:54] side i would recommend keeping those for [12:56] a while or your climb platforms there [12:58] for a good amount of time so your dog [13:00] really builds up the habit of making a [13:02] nice straight jump [13:07] all right jump [13:09] very good [13:11] that's my good girl [13:12] and now i'm gonna do one [13:15] with the toy [13:16] one last time [13:19] when we start teaching our dogs all [13:21] right please please [13:23] when we start teaching our dogs the [13:25] broad jump we can use the stick jump to [13:28] help prevent the dog from walking on top [13:30] of the broad jump when we start working [13:32] towards our akc open competitive [13:35] obedience routine [13:37] so again we're going to use the toy on [13:39] this one [13:43] hold it out and we're going to tell her [13:46] all right jump very good [13:50] good job my ari good job so we're going [13:53] to have her do a little tug and then [13:54] we're going to do a re out center and [13:57] then center command [13:59] good girl ari out and then we're going [14:02] to take her into heel [14:04] and then heal [14:07] i hope everyone enjoyed today's video if [14:10] you want one-on-one help i do offer [14:12]

obedience [00:05] routine first i want to quickly go over [00:08] the requirements and the max score that [00:10] you can receive for each exercise we [00:13] have the helon leash and figure eight [00:15] that's worth 40 points stand for [00:17] examination worth 30 points heel free [00:20] worth 40 points recall worth 30 points [00:24] sit stay and get your leash worth 30 [00:27] points and group exercise sit and down [00:30] stay worth 30 points for a possible [00:32] total of 200 points in today's video [00:35] we'll discuss in detail how to train for [00:37] the healing portion as well as the halt [00:39] and right about turns in the akc novice [00:41] obedience routine one of the first [00:43] things that the judges will look for is [00:45] the ability of the dog and the handler [00:48] to work together as a team just like [00:50] i've talked about in many of my other [00:52] videos when you enter the ring you'll [00:54] walk to the starting location with your [00:56] dog on a loose leash once you stop your [00:59] dog should sit next to you in the proper [01:01] heel position you can have the leash in [01:04] either hand or in both but your hands [01:07] should be held in a natural position [01:09] keep in mind that if the leash gets [01:11] tight or if you use an extra command or [01:13] signals you'll be pointed for that [01:16] first the judge will ask you if you're [01:18] ready once you say yes or ready or you [01:21] give them a nod or something like that [01:22] then you'll be told forward and the [01:24] judge will direct you throughout the [01:26] entire routine so you don't have to [01:27] memorize anything this exercise consists [01:30] of healing forward at a normal pace slow [01:32] pace fast pace you'll also have to do [01:34] halt right turn left turn and about [01:37] turns all of the about turns will be [01:39] right about turn so you don't have to [01:41] worry about left about turns for this [01:43] exercise for the pace changes they need [01:45] to be noticeable so fast you need to [01:47] pick up your pace and slow you need to [01:48] slow down it has to be noticeable to the [01:51] judge the judge will only order halts [01:54] and turns when you're moving at a normal [01:56] speed and keep in mind that turns and [01:58] halts can be repeated so it's important [02:00] to make sure those are really solid [02:02] before competing all of the other [02:04] commands can be given in any sequence so [02:07] uh just be aware of that and the judge [02:09] should make the healing pattern the same [02:11] for all the dogs to ensure that the [02:13] testing is fair [02:15] when the judge says forward you can give [02:17] a command or signal to your dog and [02:20] you'll start healing forward again your [02:22] dog should be close to your left side [02:24] without swinging wide lagging forging or [02:27] crowding basically the dog should [02:29] maintain the same position the entire [02:31] time look at it as a stay command that's [02:34] mobile [02:35] that also doesn't interfere with your [02:37] movement at all this can usually be a [02:39] problem if your dog tends to crowd or [02:41] push into you while you're healing when [02:43] the judge tells you to halt you must [02:45] come to a stop usually one or two extra [02:47] paces to slow down won't be pointed when [02:50] you halt your dog should automatically [02:52] sit in the proper heel position without [02:55] any additional movement from the halt [02:57] position the dog should remain still in [02:59] that position until you command the dog [03:01] to move forward on the judge's order [03:04] once this healing portion of the routine [03:06] is completed the judge will say exercise [03:10] finished now let's go over how you can [03:12] lose points [03:14] one if you have to control your dog with [03:16] the leash if you correct with the leash [03:19] or adjust to the dog's pace you'll [03:21] receive a nq which is a non-qualifying [03:24] score two you'll lose points for [03:26] additional commands or signals to heal [03:29] or for not making the pace changes [03:31] noticeable enough for the judge the [03:33] number of points you lose will depend on [03:35] how extreme or minor the mistakes are [03:37] and three you can also lose points for [03:40] lagging healing wide forging the dog's [03:43] crowding poor sits such as a crooked or [03:46] crowded sit if the dog fails to sit at [03:48] the halts or any other healing [03:51] imperfections again the number of points [03:53] that you lose will determine or will [03:55] depend really on how extreme or minor [03:57] the mistakes that you are making [03:59] according to the judge so now we have a [04:02] good idea of what's needed to [04:03] successfully pass the requirements let's [04:06] go over a training plan for each portion [04:09] first the healing command with pace [04:12] changes halts and right about turns [04:14] since halts and turns are given at a [04:17] normal pace this is when we're walking [04:19] forward at a normal pace with our dog in [04:22] heel position so what should this look [04:24] like [04:26] since we're working on competition [04:28] precision type obedience [04:30] the exercises that we're going to be [04:32] working on today if i were to break it [04:35] down into detail and explain exactly [04:37] what i'm doing in each step this video [04:39] would be over an hour long lucky for you [04:42] i've already done that in multiple [04:44] videos so if you need to i would [04:46] recommend going back to these videos and [04:49] watching each one what i'm going to be [04:51] doing today is i'm just going to be [04:53] working with my dog on every single one [04:55] of the steps that you will find in that [04:57] video so this could be a quick reference [04:59] as to what it is that you're working on [05:02] and what you're trying to accomplish [05:04] with your own dog let's get started [05:11] one of the very first things that i do [05:13] with every single dog that i train is [05:15] what's known as engagement training this [05:18] is when we are paying our dogs for [05:19] staying engaged and maintaining focus on [05:22] us while at the same time we can teach [05:24] them a position so here i'm going to be [05:26] working on the the perfect sit front [05:28] position [05:29] as well as getting her to focus on my [05:31] face and not my hands in the beginning [05:33] our dogs will be looking at our hands [05:35] because that's where they know the food [05:37] is coming from but if you'll notice in [05:39] this next portion of the video i get her [05:41] to look at my face while moving my hands [05:44] away from the line of sight of my face [05:47] so this shows me that she's able to [05:50] continue and look at my face even while [05:52] my hands are doing other things such as [05:55] moving away up and down providing an [05:57] additional distraction this takes a [06:00] little bit of time to get it to the [06:01] point that you're gonna see in this [06:02] video but i do break it down in more [06:05] detail in my video solidifying the heel [06:08] position let's check it out [06:10] yes [06:14] free [06:16] what [06:25] yes [06:26] very nice ari [06:30] yes [06:36] yes [06:46] free [06:48] very good excellent come [06:53] in this portion of the video i'm doing [06:55] the backwards follow exercise in the [06:57] beginning you're going to need to do [06:58] continual reinforcement make sure you [07:00] keep your hands up against your body [07:02] while giving the rewards because you [07:04] want your dog to maintain a very close [07:07] position as we're walking backwards if [07:10] you reward them with your hand extended [07:12] then they're not going to be as close to [07:13] you when you're doing the backwards [07:15] follow exercise [07:16] when you come to stop simply lift up on [07:18] your hands which will cue your dog to [07:20] sit and then you can give your dog a [07:22] reward and go right back into the [07:23] backwards follow exercise eventually you [07:26] want to get to the point where you can [07:27] walk backwards your dog continues to [07:29] follow you and you can have your hands [07:31] behind your back let's check it out [07:37] free [07:39] very good [07:44] come [07:53] free [07:56] very nice sorry [07:58] good girl [08:00] good girl [08:02] come [08:05] good [08:08] free [08:09] very nice [08:11] come [08:28] free very nice sorry [08:33] yes [08:34] now we're going to be working on getting [08:36] our dog to look up at our face when [08:38] they're in heel position what you want [08:40] to do is place your dog in the heel [08:41] position and then the same stuff that we [08:43] did when our dog was in the sit front [08:45] position we're going to do while our [08:47] dog's in the heel position we'll start [08:49] with keeping our hands by our face [08:50] rewarding our dog for looking up in that [08:52] direction and then we're gonna start to [08:54] move our hand away from our face when [08:56] our dog looks at us we mark the moment [08:59] they're looking at us and then we [09:00] deliver the reward and then we continue [09:02] to do this up until the point where our [09:03] dog will continue looking at our face [09:06] yes [09:15] yes [09:16] notice that i reward her with my right [09:18] hand the reason for that is because [09:20] she's anticipating the reward coming [09:22] from my left hand so i don't want to [09:24] reward her from my left hand because [09:25] then it might start causing her to look [09:28] slightly left so that's why i reach over [09:30] and i reward with my right keeping in [09:32] mind reward placement is very important [09:35] when we're doing precision obedience yes [09:47] yes [10:00] free good girl nice job [10:03] climb [10:05] heel [10:07] now i'm going to be working on what's [10:09] known as solidifying the heel position [10:11] also known as doodling it's very simple [10:14] what you want to do i like to use a [10:15] climb you can also just tell your dog to [10:17] sit or to down then you're going to find [10:20] a random position and call your dog in [10:22] to heal this helps your dog find the [10:25] heel position regardless of where they [10:27] are in reference to your position [10:31] free [10:33] climb [10:34] this next one you're gonna see she's a [10:36] little sloppy so i continue to help her [10:39] with luring as well as using that power [10:41] steering that i've talked about before [10:43] until she's able to get into the [10:44] position and even though she doesn't do [10:46] a great job finding the position and i [10:48] even have to tell her to sit i still [10:50] reward her afterwards because if a dog [10:53] is struggling we do want to reward them [10:55] for putting in effort if you don't [10:57] reward them because it doesn't look as [10:59] good as you want it to look then you're [11:01] gonna find that your dog is going to [11:02] quickly become more and more demotivated [11:05] so i try to increase or keep that [11:07] motivation high even if the dog's not [11:09] doing a great job as long as they're [11:10] trying and they're working towards what [11:12] it is i'm trying to get them to do so [11:14] you'll see what i mean [11:22] sit [11:24] free [11:25] climb [11:35] heel [11:37] free [11:38] good [11:40] climb [11:48] heel [11:53] free [11:55] very nice climb [12:01] heel [12:05] free [12:06] very good ari [12:08] nice job [12:11] now we're going to be working on the [12:12] center command i like to place my dog in [12:14] the center position and then work on [12:16] that engagement the same way we did when [12:17] our dog's in the heel position as well [12:19] as the sit front position once i'm able [12:22] to get my dog to understand that they [12:23] have to maintain the center position and [12:25] look up at my face then we'll start to [12:27] walk with our dog i like to walk in [12:29] multiple directions forward backward [12:31] left right i like to work on my about [12:33] turns right about turn left about turn [12:35] left turn right turn because our legs [12:37] help create a barrier which makes it [12:39] much easier for our dogs to accomplish [12:41] these movements and that's going to [12:43] transfer over very nicely into our [12:46] focused heel yes [12:47] very nice [12:50] yes [12:51] excellent ari [12:57] free [12:58] good girl [13:07] good [13:08] good job [13:13] yes [13:14] excellent nice work [13:18] free [13:19] very good [13:23] before having my dog walk and maintain [13:25] the center position i also like to get [13:27] my dog to understand how to pivot in [13:29] place you could do that using a bowl but [13:31] you can also do that just by pivoting [13:33] the way that i'm going to be [13:34] demonstrating in this portion of the [13:36] video [13:37] free very good [13:41] free excellent nice job bari [13:47] good girl [13:53] free [13:54] very good [13:58] free [13:59] good girl [14:00] this is also a good opportunity to work [14:02] on your pace changes whatever [14:03] competitive obedience routine that [14:05] you're working on whatever they require [14:08] within that routine you should be [14:09] practicing while your dog's in center [14:11] position such as our pace changes our [14:14] left turn our right turn our about turn [14:16] and our halts [14:27] free [14:28] excellent work ari [14:32] free good now i'm working on getting my [14:35] dog to walk backwards this is much [14:37] easier to teach than you may think first [14:39] we walk towards our dog with our hands [14:41] closed that will normally get them to [14:43] walk backwards when you first start [14:44] teaching this the very first step that [14:46] your dog takes mark and reward that as [14:49] your dog starts to understand it more [14:50] then you can ask for more and more steps [14:53] and then eventually if you want you can [14:55] add a command the more body awareness [14:57] and rear end awareness our dogs have the [15:00] better they're going to be at any sort [15:01] of precision obedience that we ask them [15:03] to perform free very nice [15:09] free good girl [15:13] free very good ari [15:18] back [15:19] free good [15:24] back free very nice [15:29] back [15:31] free good girl [15:36] back [15:40] free [15:40] very nice [15:42] down [15:44] come [15:50] free good [15:56] come [15:57] now i'm using the backwards follow [15:58] exercise to transition my dog into the [16:00] proper heel position by going from the [16:03] backwards follow exercise into the heel [16:05] position it helps keep our dogs straight [16:08] without this portion of the training if [16:10] we skip this there is a good possibility [16:12] that our dogs may end up being a little [16:14] bit more crooked when they're in the [16:16] heel position so it's definitely worth [16:18] your time to invest in this exercise and [16:21] get good at transitioning your dog from [16:23] that backwards follow right into that [16:25] perfect heel position free [16:27] very nice [16:31] come [16:37] free [16:37] very good [16:39] down [16:42] our heel now we're going to be using our [16:44] power steering or our luring to work on [16:47] our focused heel during this portion of [16:49] the training i pretty much am using [16:51] continual reinforcement i'm walking and [16:53] i'm feeding the dog almost the entire [16:55] time in the beginning our dogs aren't [16:57] even really going to know what they're [16:59] doing but it is going to be helping them [17:02] with that muscle memory which is going [17:04] to make it much easier when we do start [17:06] asking them to walk in our focused heel [17:08] position without that continual [17:09] reinforcement so this should be fun i [17:12] like to incorporate all kinds of [17:13] different things while i'm doing this [17:14] whether i'm trying to pivot in place i'm [17:16] turning left i'm turning right i'm [17:17] walking backwards i'm placing my dog [17:20] into different commanded positions sit [17:22] down all these different things we can [17:24] do while we're doing this power steering [17:26] working on our dog maintaining that [17:28] focused heel position [17:30] free good [17:41] free very nice [17:51] good girl [18:00] free very good [18:02] heel [18:06] free [18:07] very nice [18:09] now in this section of the video i'm [18:10] working on getting my dog to walk while [18:12] in heel position what we do for this [18:14] exercise is we place our dog in a [18:16] sitting position in our heel position [18:19] then we give the command heel after we [18:21] give the command heal we bring our hand [18:23] up and we lure our dog with our hands [18:25] while we start to walk forward once [18:27] we're ready to stop we lure them into [18:29] the sit and then we mark and reward we [18:32] can have our hand come in from different [18:33] positions whether it's on the outside of [18:36] our dog's head while it's hanging down [18:37] by our side or what i like to do as well [18:39] is keep my hand behind my back and then [18:41] when i say heal i bring my hand over my [18:44] dog's head which will get my dog to [18:46] anticipate my hand coming over her head [18:48] so she'll look up when i say heal [18:51] anticipating my hand to come to that [18:54] position which will give us that really [18:56] nice focused heel look [18:59] free [19:00] very good ari [19:10] keel [19:13] free [19:14] nice work [19:17] are you here [19:25] heel [19:29] free [19:29] very good [19:31] now we're going to start asking our dogs [19:33] to walk in heel position without that [19:35] continual reinforcement start with very [19:38] short distances and as your dog gets [19:40] better you can ask for more paces but in [19:43] the very beginning only a few steps and [19:45] it's also good to change the amount of [19:47] steps that you do each time so you may [19:49] take three steps the first time six [19:51] steps the second time two steps the [19:54] third time and so on by making it random [19:57] it's going to make it more interesting [19:58] and more fun for our dogs [20:01] cue [20:04] free nice job [20:07] very good ari heel [20:18] cue free [20:21] very good [20:23] come on ari [20:29] q [20:32] free [20:33] very good [20:39] heel [20:41] free [20:42] very good ari [20:44] nice job [20:46] heel now we're going to be working on [20:48] our pace changes in the akc novice [20:50] obedience routine they're only going to [20:52] call you into a slow pace or a fast pace [20:55] while you're in a normal pace you're not [20:57] going to go from slow to fast or fast to [20:59] slow it will always be normal to slow [21:02] back to normal normal to fast back to [21:04] normal however i do like teaching my dog [21:07] all kinds of different paces regardless [21:09] of which pace i'm currently in [21:11] as i transition into the next pace it's [21:14] just getting our dogs really good at [21:16] staying in our heel position regardless [21:19] of what pace we are at we can help them [21:21] maintain this by giving them those [21:24] continual reinforcement treating them [21:26] quite a bit and also making it fun by [21:28] using that engagement a lot of people [21:30] like to incorporate toys during this [21:32] part of their training because it gets [21:34] their dog a little bit more motivated [21:36] and pumped up to do this exercise you [21:40] free [21:41] good girl [21:46] heel [21:49] free [21:50] very good ari [21:56] q [22:00] free [22:01] go ahead [22:02] heel [22:05] cue [22:06] three [22:08] good [22:11] heel [22:14] heel [22:17] heel and you are allowed to recommand [22:19] heal when you go into a new pace so when [22:22] they tell you fast pace you can say heal [22:24] before you increase your speed and when [22:26] they tell you slow pace you can say heal [22:30] when you decrease your speed letting [22:32] your dog know something's about to take [22:34] place free [22:35] nice work ari heal [22:38] good girl [22:40] good very good ari [22:46] free [22:47] very good [22:49] dumb [22:50] excellent [22:51] heel now we want to work on what i like [22:53] to call the spiral technique this is [22:55] where we ask our dog to heal as we go [22:57] from a large circle into a smaller [23:00] circle until we're eventually pivoting [23:02] in place this is going to make it very [23:05] easy when we start asking our dog to do [23:07] the right about turn good [23:11] good girl [23:16] free [23:17] very good [23:22] good very good [23:24] during this step in the training we're [23:26] gonna start introducing our dog to the [23:28] right about turn you're gonna see as i [23:30] do this i like to step forward with my [23:31] left leg and then i use my lure to guide [23:34] my dog around my leg staying tight close [23:36] to my body this is going to help keep [23:38] our dog tight and close when we do that [23:41] right about turn which will prevent the [23:42] lagging and it'll also teach our dog to [23:45] increase the speed when we do our right [23:47] about turns because in order for our [23:49] dogs to maintain proper heel position as [23:51] we do our right about turn they have to [23:53] increase speed and these techniques that [23:56] i'm about to demonstrate with ari will [23:58] help your dog understand that and will [24:00] make your right about turns look very [24:02] nice good girl [24:12] good [24:14] are you here [24:20] good girl [24:36] good [24:39] very good [24:49] free [24:50] good [24:52] go climb [24:55] when you're doing your right about turns [24:57] it helps to focus on your footwork which [24:59] is going to help increase your dog's [25:00] overall score to minimize losing any [25:03] additional points when you're going to [25:05] step to do your right about turn the [25:07] easy way for me to remember it is if i [25:09] know i'm doing a right about turn right [25:10] turn left about turn or left turn [25:13] the last foot that i do a full normal [25:15] step is the foot in the direction that [25:16] i'm stepping so for my right about turn [25:19] i will step with my right foot then my [25:21] left foot comes around almost making a [25:23] t-shape with my two feet and then my [25:25] right foot will pivot back facing in the [25:27] opposite direction and then i'll step [25:29] with a full left foot step so again i'm [25:32] going to the right so last step boom we [25:35] make that t-shape we turn and then we [25:37] step again so right left right [25:40] left if i'm doing a left turn or left [25:43] about turn it's going to be left then we [25:46] make the t then we turn and then we step [25:49] we have to make sure we are on a [25:51] straight line if i'm doing a left turn [25:53] same thing but instead of pivoting [25:56] around to go the opposite direction that [25:58] i just came [26:00] i'm going to turn and step in the [26:02] direction that i'm going so it should [26:04] look like this we step with our left [26:06] turn with our right step with our left [26:09] and then we go into that direction with [26:11] our right turn we step with the right [26:14] turn with the left [26:16] step with the right [26:18] when doing our left and right turns [26:21] by simply teaching our dog left about [26:24] turns and right about turns it makes our [26:27] left and right turns very very easy so i [26:29] spend a lot of time working on my left [26:32] and right about turns before i even [26:34] start focusing on my right or left turns [26:37] because if they can do the left and [26:38] right about turn they can definitely do [26:40] the left and right turn [26:42] heel before doing this step you want to [26:44] make sure your dog can do a nice sit [26:46] while doing the backwards follow [26:48] exercise as well as a nice sit while [26:50] doing the center position if you have [26:52] that down now we can start introducing [26:54] the automatic sit when halted there's [26:56] three different ways that i like to [26:57] teach this one i simply lure the dog [27:00] into the sit position when i come to a [27:02] stop or i can tell the dog to sit every [27:05] time i come to a stop and last but not [27:07] least we can use the leash pressure to [27:10] guide our dog into the sit position you [27:12] want to make sure when you're doing this [27:14] you reward your dog when they're in a [27:16] proper heel position as you come to a [27:18] halt if you stop and your dog is lagging [27:20] or forging simply walk forward readjust [27:23] and then reward your dog when they're in [27:25] proper heal position free [27:27] good [27:30] heel [27:36] free good [27:44] heel [27:46] sit free [27:49] good [27:52] heel [27:56] heel [27:59] free [28:00] very nice [28:02] come on ari [28:04] heal whichever one of these techniques [28:06] you decide to use for your dog just [28:08] continue to do it up until the point [28:10] where your dog will start to [28:12] automatically sit without that [28:14] additional assistance remember our dogs [28:16] learn through pattern recognition if [28:18] they know that every time when you come [28:20] to a stop you're going to have them sit [28:22] then they will do that automatically [28:25] free good girl [28:27] next week we'll be working on our left [28:29] and right turns for the akc novice [28:32] routine as well as proper footwork i [28:34] hope everyone

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 309/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we'll be discussing in [00:02] detail how to train for the left and [00:03] right turns for the akc novice obedience [00:06] routines heel on leash exercise as i [00:09] mentioned in last week's video when you [00:11] enter the ring you'll walk to the [00:13] starting location with your dog on a [00:15] loose leash once you stop your dog [00:17] should sit next to you in the proper [00:19] heel position remember you can have the [00:21] leash in either hand or both but your [00:23] hands should be held in a natural [00:26] position when the judge says forward you [00:29] can give a command or signal to your dog [00:31] and you'll start healing forward again [00:33] your dog should be as close to your left [00:35] side without swinging wide lagging [00:37] crowding or forging or any other healing [00:40] imperfection everything that applies to [00:42] the healing also applies to the left and [00:45] right turns when the judge says left [00:47] turn or right turn you have maybe one or [00:50] two steps before you have to start [00:52] making the turn and this is what we're [00:53] going to be focusing on today once this [00:56] healing portion of the akc novice [00:58] routine is complete the judge will say [01:00] exercise finished now let's go over how [01:03] you can lose points for this [01:05] one if you have to control or correct [01:07] the dog with the leash or if you adjust [01:10] to your dog's pace you'll receive a [01:12] non-qualifying score number two you'll [01:15] lose points for any additional commands [01:17] or signals and three when making the [01:20] turns you can lose points if your dog is [01:22] lagging healing wide forging or crowding [01:25] or again any other healing imperfections [01:27] the number of points you lose will [01:29] depend on how extreme or minor the [01:31] mistakes are according to your judge so [01:33] we're going to do the best to minimize [01:35] any mistakes [01:37] before getting started i wanted to [01:39] mention that today's video is designed [01:41] in order to show you what techniques or [01:44] what training i like to do in order to [01:45] prepare my dog for the akc novice [01:47] routine all of these techniques that i'm [01:49] going to be demonstrating and working [01:51] with my dog are training techniques that [01:53] i've taught in detail in other videos on [01:55] my channel if you'd like to watch any of [01:58] them i will be placing the links in the [01:59] description for your convenience let's [02:02] get started [02:04] good girl [02:06] very good [02:09] one of the first things i like to do [02:10] when working on my left and right turns [02:12] is to make sure the dog i'm training can [02:14] pivot in place we can do that by using a [02:16] place bowl as i'm doing here with ari or [02:19] we can simply have them pivot in place [02:21] as i demonstrated in last week's video [02:23] this helps teach our dog rear end [02:25] awareness which will help a great deal [02:27] with our left and right turns first we [02:29] can do this exercise with our dog in [02:31] front of us and then we can also have [02:33] our dogs work the pivot while in the [02:34] heel position [02:36] yes very good ari [02:45] good [02:47] free [02:49] i also like to continue working on [02:50] having my dog walk backwards i recommend [02:53] this not only to help with our dog's [02:55] body awareness but also helps with our [02:57] left turns and left about turns [02:59] free good [03:02] back [03:04] free good back [03:11] free [03:12] very nice [03:17] back [03:21] three [03:22] excellent good girl [03:25] i know a lot of these are being repeated [03:27] from last week's video but these [03:29] exercises have more than one purpose the [03:31] spiral technique is great for our right [03:34] and left turns because it shows our dogs [03:36] that they need to slow down on the left [03:38] turn and speed up on our right turns you [03:41] can start with continual reinforcement [03:43] but you want to get to the point where [03:45] you can do this without any rewards at [03:47] least until the dog completes the [03:49] exercise so we can do the entire [03:51] technique all the way to the very end [03:52] once we finish release our dog and give [03:55] them a reward [04:02] free [04:04] you as i said in last week's video when [04:06] i'm training my dog to perform a left [04:08] and right turn i like to work on the [04:10] left and right about turns usually if a [04:12] dog can do the about turns then the [04:14] normal left and right turn seems much [04:17] easier we can use a food lure or leash [04:20] pressure to help with this exercise when [04:22] i'm working on the right turn i like to [04:23] step forward with my left leg and guide [04:25] my dog around very quickly using a lure [04:28] to teach my dog to increase speed for [04:30] the right about turn the left is usually [04:32] more difficult than the right it's also [04:35] very complicated for our dogs to learn i [04:38] would recommend doing countless [04:39] repetitions of this exercise with your [04:41] dogs of course spaced out over time you [04:44] wouldn't want to over train in one [04:46] session because even when a dog knows [04:48] what to do the left about turn is still [04:51] very challenging because the movement [04:53] itself is difficult [05:05] free good [05:13] free very nice sorry [05:17] heel [05:24] free good [05:26] down [05:27] spin [05:28] heel [05:37] free [05:38] heal [05:46] very good [05:51] excellent [05:57] free [05:59] very good [06:05] free good [06:15] free [06:15] good [06:18] that's it [06:21] heel [06:24] heel [06:28] free [06:30] heel [06:36] free good [06:40] heel [06:44] heel [06:51] free good [06:57] sit [06:58] heel [07:04] free good girl [07:06] excellent [07:10] sit [07:12] heel [07:17] free good heal [07:23] free [07:24] heal [07:28] free [07:29] good girl [07:32] now we're gonna start with the actual [07:34] turns we can start with wide turns first [07:36] to make it much easier for our dogs when [07:38] we feel that they're performing that the [07:40] way that we like then we can start [07:41] making a sharper left or right turn at [07:44] first you'll probably need to use a lot [07:46] of lowering or leash pressure to help [07:48] your dog out but as they get better with [07:51] this you can start to reduce the amount [07:52] of rewards given free very good ari [07:56] very good let's do that again [08:04] free nice [08:07] nice work [08:12] heel [08:17] free very good [08:26] free very good ari [08:36] free [08:37] heel [08:42] free [08:43]

AKC Novice Heeling Walkthrough for Practice: Are you ready? Forward Left turn Fast Normal Left turn Halt Forward, About-turn Right turn Slow Normal About turn Halt Exercise finished Line up for the figure 8 Are you ready?"
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 312/841,Forward Halt Forward Halt Exercise finished === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] the figure eight exercise is essentially [00:02] the same as the heel on leash exercise [00:04] with the addition of you and your dog as [00:06] a team negotiating two cones or a [00:09] similar object these cones should be [00:11] placed about eight feet actually they [00:13] should be placed eight feet apart when [00:15] starting this exercise have your dog in [00:17] heel position midway between the two [00:20] cones facing the judge but don't stress [00:22] this position too much because the first [00:24] sit in any exercise is not scored but of [00:28] course it is always good to practice and [00:30] ensure that your dog is sitting straight [00:32] next the judge will ask you are you [00:34] ready when you're ready respond with [00:36] ready or yes or not of the head or [00:39] something similar [00:40] after you've indicated you're ready the [00:42] judge will tell you forward at this [00:45] point you'll start to heal with your dog [00:46] around the cones as the handler you get [00:49] to choose which direction you want to go [00:51] first however i recommend going left as [00:55] many judges will wait to give the halt [00:57] command after you've gone around the [00:59] right cone meaning if you choose to go [01:01] right first you'll have to go around the [01:03] right then the left then the right and [01:05] then you'll do the halt if you go left [01:07] you'll go around the left then the right [01:09] and then you'll be told to halt so [01:11] you'll have less of a chance to lose [01:13] points if you choose to go left [01:16] you'll want to ensure that you're [01:17] walking at a normal pace the entire time [01:20] around and between each cone twice in a [01:22] figure eight pattern the judge will [01:24] order a halt during the exercise [01:26] and one at the end of the exercise [01:29] you'll never hear a judge order an about [01:31] turn or slow face or fast pace during [01:33] the figure eight it's your choice to [01:35] give a signal or command to begin the [01:37] healing at the beginning and after the [01:39] first hold any additional commands will [01:41] be scored just keep in mind that you can [01:44] receive a non-qualifying score if you're [01:46] giving your dog too many additional [01:48] commands [01:49] the judge will determine if the [01:51] additional commands shows that you lack [01:53] control of your dog [01:54] also try not to worry about the movement [01:56] from the judge this gets a lot of people [01:58] the judge is required to review the [02:00] dog's position and the dog's performance [02:03] of the exercises in order to better [02:05] determine the accuracy of the dog's [02:07] healing and holds [02:08] just like we discussed in the healing [02:10] exercise [02:11] minor or major deductions will be made [02:13] for any lagging healing wide poor sits [02:16] forging crowding or failure to sit at [02:18] the halt or any other healing [02:20] imperfections deductions are not just [02:22] for the dog handlers who guide the dog [02:24] with the leash can get points deducted [02:26] for tightening or jerking on the leash [02:28] or for not walking at a brisk pace your [02:30] dog should always be adapting to your [02:32] movements as a handler and not the other [02:34] way around if the judge perceives that [02:37] you're adapting to your dog you could [02:39] receive a non-qualifying score [02:41] the point of the exercise where this is [02:44] most closely looked at is during the [02:46] turns around the cones on the inside [02:48] turn the dog must slow down in order to [02:50] maintain heel position and on the [02:52] outside turn the dog will have to speed [02:54] up to maintain heel position just make [02:56] sure that you're always paying attention [02:58] to the judge's orders because you and [03:00] your dog should not start before you're [03:02] ordered by the judge [03:04] this includes waiting for the judge to [03:06] say exercise finish before releasing [03:08] your dog [03:10] i'll post a link in the description to [03:12] the obedience regulations where you can [03:13] take a closer look it'll be section 5 [03:16] which covers the figure 8 exercise [03:19] if you want to practice the entire [03:20] routine for the heel on leash and figure [03:22] 8 portion i would recommend having a [03:24] friend or family member play the role of [03:26] the judge walking you through the [03:28] routine so your dog gets used to this [03:30] picture having someone call you through [03:33] a pattern is much different to the dog [03:35] than training the routine without [03:37] someone calling you through this will [03:38] help you properly prepare for the [03:40] competition i'll make sure i have an [03:42] example pattern written out in the [03:44] description of this video [03:48] for the first exercise i'm going to [03:49] start with doing two double about turns [03:52] this is something that i learned from [03:53] tom rose at the tom rose school in fact [03:55] i do have another video on teaching the [03:57] figure eight instructed by tom rose [03:59] himself i would definitely recommend [04:01] checking that out this is an excellent [04:03] exercise you can do it with a lure you [04:05] can also do it with leash pressure with [04:07] ari in this video i'm going to be using [04:09] both techniques to show how it should [04:11] look now ari is lagging as well as [04:14] forging a few times while doing this [04:16] exercise it is difficult and it's [04:18] something that i'm gonna have to [04:19] continue to work on myself in order to [04:21] sharpen ari's obedience while doing this [04:24] exercise but let's go ahead and get [04:26] started [04:30] good [04:33] free [04:34] very nice [04:37] down sit good [04:39] heel as you can see the concept behind [04:41] this exercise is to teach the dog that [04:43] when we start to turn left whether it's [04:45] a left about turn or we're going around [04:48] a cone for the figure eight portion of [04:50] the healing exercise our dog needs to [04:52] slow down and you can see when we turn [04:54] right our dog has to increase speed this [04:57] exercise really helps them understand [04:59] that concept and it transfers over very [05:02] nicely to the figure eight that we're [05:04] going to need to perform for the akc [05:06] novice very good [05:12] free [05:13] very good ari [05:16] you [05:25] free [05:26] good girl [05:28] heel as i come around the first cone i'm [05:30] gonna do that pivoting place exercise [05:32] that tom rose teaches again this is [05:34] showing ari that when i go around the [05:36] left object there is a possibility that [05:39] i'm going to pivot in place which is [05:41] going to make her more aware and focused [05:43] on what i'm doing which will get her to [05:45] slow down when we go around the left [05:47] object [05:49] very good free [05:50] excellent nice job [05:53] nice job my ari heel [06:02] good heel [06:11] free [06:12] excellent nice [06:15] ari [06:16] heel [06:19] heel [06:20] now i'm gonna go around the right object [06:22] again and i'm going to pivot in place [06:24] you'll also see that ari's having a good [06:26] time this is a fun exercise if we take [06:28] our time with it and we don't expect too [06:30] much from our dogs too quickly we need [06:32] to have fun because if we're having fun [06:34] our dogs are going to have fun [06:38] good [06:42] heel [06:48] free excellent nice work [06:51] and now i'm gonna go through the [06:52] exercise as though i was being called [06:54] through by a judge during the akc novice [06:57] routine of course no one's calling me [06:59] through but it would be forward and then [07:00] they would give you a halt and then they [07:02] would give you forward and then one more [07:04] halt exercise finished [07:11] heel [07:21] free [07:22] next week we'll be working on the stand [07:24] for examination for the akc novice [07:26] routine i hope you

discuss in detail [00:02] how to train for the stand for [00:03] examination in the akc novice routine as [00:06] described in the rule book the principal [00:08] feature of this exercise is that the dog [00:11] stand in position before and during the [00:14] examination without displaying [00:16] resentment there are three commands [00:18] you'll be told by the judge for this [00:20] portion of the routine [00:21] stand your dog and leave when you are [00:23] ready [00:24] back to your dog and exercise finished [00:28] before starting this exercise you will [00:30] remove your dog's leash and hand it to [00:32] the steward you will then take your dog [00:35] to the place indicated by the judge as [00:38] in each exercise the judge will ask are [00:41] you ready when the judge tells you to [00:44] stand your dog and leave when you are [00:46] ready you can then stand and pose your [00:48] dog by the method of your choice you can [00:51] take any reasonable time if you choose [00:53] to pose your dog as in the show ring you [00:56] will then stand with your dog in the [00:58] heel position and if you choose give [00:59] your dog a command or signal to stay [01:02] then walk straight forward about six [01:04] feet usually three full steps will [01:07] accomplish this and then turn and face [01:09] your dog [01:10] next the judge will approach your dog [01:12] from the front and will touch your dog's [01:14] head body and hind quarters once [01:17] completed you will be told back to your [01:19] dog once given that order you will walk [01:22] around and behind your dog back into the [01:25] heel position once you get back into the [01:27] heel position the judge will say [01:28] exercised finished your dog must remain [01:32] standing until given that order [01:35] according to the rule book your dog does [01:37] not need to be sitting at the start of [01:39] this exercise when you're told to leave [01:41] your dog the judge is required to be [01:43] alert and to keep you from getting more [01:46] or less than the six feet also keep in [01:49] mind that you will be pointed even to [01:51] the point of being non-qualified if you [01:54] back away when leaving because of this [01:56] it's best to walk straight forward three [01:58] steps and then turn around to face your [02:00] dog the examination is completed when [02:02] the judge lifts their fingers and palm [02:04] from the dog's hindquarters if the judge [02:07] thinks that your dog may bite you should [02:09] excuse your dog from the ring your dog [02:11] will be disqualified if your dog tries [02:14] to bite or attack anybody in the ring [02:16] now for the scoring which doesn't start [02:19] until you give the command or signal for [02:22] your dog to stay however you will be [02:25] penalized substantially if you are to [02:27] use rough treatment to get your dog into [02:30] the stand [02:31] or you receive active resistment from [02:34] your dog to stand since this is a stand [02:37] for examination you should look at it as [02:39] a stance state meaning you will receive [02:40] a non-qualifying score if your dog sits [02:43] lies down leaves the stand stayed by [02:45] moving out of position basically if your [02:47] dog breaks the stance stay in any way [02:49] growls snaps or displays resentment [02:52] either before or during the examination [02:55] you can also receive minor or [02:56] substantial deductions up to the point [02:58] of being enqueued non-qualifying score [03:00] for any shyness type behaviors that [03:02] could be displayed by your dog lastly [03:04] you can also lose points if your dog [03:06] moves its paws at any time or sits or [03:09] moves after the completion of the [03:11] examination [03:13] okay now that we know what we need to do [03:16] let's jump into the training in addition [03:18] i do have a couple other videos on my [03:20] channel one teaching the stand using [03:23] multiple dogs in the video so you can [03:25] see what it looks like if you're working [03:26] with a puppy or a larger or an older dog [03:29] and i have a video on the stand for [03:31] examination which i recommend checking [03:32] that out as well the more information [03:34] you can get on the subject the better [03:36] just like everything we do when it comes [03:38] to dog training first we want to make [03:40] sure we can teach our dog to perform the [03:42] behavior using a physical cue that [03:44] guarantees our dog will do the behavior [03:46] every single time [03:47] the two most common techniques are going [03:49] to be the luring technique which i'm [03:51] going to demonstrate as well as using [03:53] leash pressure and other physical ways [03:55] of assisting our dog to understand what [03:57] it is we're asking them to perform so [03:59] with the luring technique [04:01] and remember when we're first teaching a [04:02] behavior we don't have to worry about [04:05] giving the behavior a command until we [04:07] know we can get our dog to do that [04:09] behavior [04:10] remember wherever the nose goes the butt [04:12] does the opposite so if we lift up nose [04:15] goes up butt goes down if we go straight [04:17] down we can get the dog into a down [04:19] position and if we bring our hand [04:21] towards the dog's chest then usually [04:23] this will get our dog to pop their back [04:26] end up once they do that then we can [04:28] mark and reward that behavior [04:30] it may take a little bit of work the [04:32] first time you attempt to do this [04:34] sometimes with new dogs or puppies i [04:36] have to move forward a little bit just [04:38] to get them to pick up that rear end and [04:40] then i can tuck underneath which will [04:41] get it to elevate a little bit more and [04:43] then we can mark and reward so [04:46] as you can see i have it in my hand and [04:48] i'm going to tuck it under and i'm going [04:50] to roll my hand back which is going to [04:52] get her to try to bring her muzzle over [04:54] and across my fingers which will [04:56] naturally bring up her back end [04:58] see just like that and then i can handle [05:00] the food when you're doing this step you [05:03] can mark and reward or you can simply [05:05] give your dog the reward the moment they [05:07] get into the position remember if we're [05:09] trying to capture a specific behavior we [05:11] have to reward the dog within a second [05:13] so we have two options either we can [05:15] give the dog the primary reinforcer in [05:17] this case it's a piece of food the [05:19] moment she does the behavior or we can [05:21] mark and then follow up with the food so [05:24] i can tuck under yes and i can give her [05:26] the food when we're doing the step where [05:28] we're teaching the behavior or the [05:29] physical cue to get the dog to do the [05:31] behavior you can use either mark or your [05:33] continuation marker so in ari's case [05:36] that's the yes that just means that [05:37] she's going to receive a reward it [05:39] guarantees a reward or you can use your [05:41] terminal marker for arie it's f-r-e-e so [05:45] that means she's going to get a reward [05:47] but she's also released from the [05:49] position now when we're not giving our [05:51] dog a command we don't have to worry [05:53] about [05:54] releasing or maintaining a stay because [05:56] we haven't given a command yet so during [05:58] this step you can use either one they're [06:00] interchangeable since again you're not [06:02] having to release your dog from a stay [06:06] yes [06:07] or [06:08] alternatively [06:11] free [06:11] so again getting that cue to get your [06:13] dog to do the behavior once you [06:15] guarantee that you can do that then we [06:17] can go ahead and we can add a command to [06:19] it or we can name the behavior when we [06:21] name the behavior make sure you're not [06:23] overshadowing remember overshadowing [06:25] means if two things are presented to a [06:28] dog at the exact same time whatever is [06:30] more relevant to our dog is what they're [06:32] going to focus on so in this case [06:34] they're going to focus on the physical [06:35] cue so what i mean by that if you do [06:37] this [06:38] sit [06:39] free [06:40] your dog's not going to learn the [06:42] command as you notice i said the word as [06:45] i lifted my hand same thing with any [06:47] other command if i go down [06:49] even though my dog's doing the behavior [06:51] she's not learning the command it has to [06:53] be predictable so what i like to tell [06:55] people is pretend you're asking your dog [06:57] a question so i'm asking my dog do you [06:59] know what to do when i tell you to stand [07:01] and she goes no i don't know what to do [07:03] and then i give her the answer by luring [07:05] her into the position so think question [07:07] then answer so it'd be like this now i'm [07:10] going to use a different word for her [07:11] stand command [07:13] just so we can see the process instead [07:16] of her just jumping up into the position [07:17] when i give the command so for this [07:19] example i'm going to use the word post [07:21] so we go [07:22] post [07:23] then the queue free [07:25] then the reward now when i'm teaching [07:27] this i like to use the terminal marker [07:28] once i start adding the command so we [07:30] don't have to worry about maintaining [07:32] the stay position if you're worried [07:34] about your dog shifting so if you notice [07:36] she shifts a little bit you'll see how [07:38] her back end turns a little bit [07:40] post [07:41] you see how [07:42] she doesn't maintain that straight [07:44] position [07:45] i'm personally not too worried about it [07:47] but if i want to fix it or if i was [07:49] worried about it then we can do this [07:51] exercise right next to a wall which will [07:54] remove the option of her shifting her [07:56] back into the side so if you are running [07:59] into that using a wall is a great tool [08:01] to help sharpen up and add to that [08:03] precision so we continue to do it post [08:06] so you can see she's already starting to [08:08] do it on the command again she's turning [08:10] off a little bit to the side so that is [08:11] something that we could adjust free [08:15] now we're going to start working on [08:17] the stay so the stay [08:19] the same way we teach any stay is going [08:22] to be the same exact way we teach the [08:24] stand stay so if she breaks the [08:26] beginning or if she breaks the position [08:28] in the beginning we're not going to [08:30] correct our dog because again when [08:32] they're learning something new we don't [08:33] want to implement any sort of [08:35] corrections but [08:37] once they know it then for reliability [08:39] you can do that in the beginning we like [08:41] to use our marker that predicts negative [08:43] reinforcement so our leash pressure i [08:45] like to use the word wrong now i would [08:47] also recommend teaching all your other [08:49] stays before teaching a stan stay [08:52] because the stance day is going to be [08:53] much more difficult than something like [08:55] a sit stay or a down stay so what we're [08:57] going to do is we're going to hook the [08:58] leash on and then we're also going to [09:00] use this [09:01] to teach her the stand command so for [09:03] the stand i like to pull a little bit [09:05] forward the moment our dog pops up their [09:08] back end then we mark and reward when i [09:10] do this if i need to assist the dog i [09:12] could simply bring my foot and tuck it [09:14] right underneath her belly which will [09:16] get him to pop their back end up how [09:18] she's doing now because i've done this [09:19] with her already so she knows that and [09:21] she knows to pop up her back in but [09:24] when i start to pull forward [09:27] so she's really thinking trying to [09:28] figure out what she wants me to or what [09:30] i want her to do so i have the leash [09:32] directly in front i'm gonna pull a [09:33] little bit [09:36] okay so she's struggling [09:39] so what i'm going to do is i'm going to [09:40] pull then i'm going to cue her with the [09:42] leash [09:43] free [09:44] since she already knows the leash [09:45] pressure sorry i'm going to cure her [09:46] with the food [09:48] so i'm going to do this a couple times [09:50] just to help her out all the talking is [09:52] making it more difficult [09:54] free good so that one she did she did [09:56] nicely [09:58] and remember when you're teaching a new [09:59] behavior we do continual reinforcement [10:01] meaning you reward every correct [10:02] repetition so i pull forward free the [10:04] moment she does it i'm marking reward [10:11] free good [10:13] and again it's also good to teach your [10:15] dog that when you bring your foot [10:16] underneath to pop their back end up as [10:19] well because that's going to help when [10:21] you have your dog in heel position so [10:23] we're not worried about doing this in [10:24] heel position we just want to get her to [10:26] understand the behavior you could also [10:28] do when you're teaching this if you're [10:30] having issues with your dog shifting [10:31] back and forth you can use a shaping box [10:33] or you could even use something like a [10:35] painter's bench which has a very narrow [10:38] area for the dog to stand on which [10:39] prevents them from shifting too much [10:41] left or right for that precision type [10:42] obedience now what i do when i first [10:45] start teaching the stand stay because it [10:47] is very difficult and you don't want [10:48] your dog to move their paws around too [10:50] much i teach them that i can hold the [10:53] leash here and then if i need to i could [10:55] bring my hand underneath in order to get [10:57] them to do that stand stay wrong [11:00] so see right there she moves so anytime [11:02] they move [11:03] i say wrong and then i simply readjust [11:06] now i'm watching her feet or her paws to [11:08] make sure they don't move at all [11:10] we don't want them to move if they move [11:11] in the slightest bit [11:13] say wrong and that wrong like right [11:16] there even if they just move one of the [11:18] paws i'm still going to say wrong and [11:20] i'm going to readjust them i want them [11:21] to stand as completely still as possible [11:24] once you get this you're going to start [11:25] building distance just like any other [11:27] exercise step back wrong and if they [11:29] break the position [11:31] readjust [11:32] now you're not going to be able to get [11:34] your dog's paws wrong [11:36] directly back in the exact same position [11:39] but you want to get them as close as [11:40] possible [11:43] and you can be calm about this you don't [11:45] have to run you don't have to get [11:46] excited all you have to do is make sure [11:48] you say your marker the moment your dog [11:50] breaks the position so when i use that [11:52] marker i'm basically telling my dog to [11:55] either stop what you're doing or go back [11:57] to the previous position and i adjust [11:59] using that leash pressure cue that we've [12:00] taught our dog previously [12:02] now as our dog is doing well we can give [12:05] feedback either by verbal praise like [12:06] good girl nice job very good let her [12:09] know or let your dog know they're doing [12:10] it correctly another option is we can [12:12] mark and reward so we're going to start [12:14] building a little bit of distance and [12:16] since we are working on precision type [12:18] obedience if our dog moves their paws at [12:20] all just say wrong and then give them a [12:21] readjustment even if they don't seem to [12:24] like it [12:25] they have to know that they have to [12:26] maintain the position and if you're [12:28] going to mark with the continuation [12:29] marker make sure your dog doesn't move [12:30] in order to gain access to the reward if [12:32] your dog does a wrong or a no can [12:36] override your marker so don't give your [12:38] dog the reward if they break the [12:40] position because then you're going to be [12:41] rewarding your dog for breaking the [12:43] position so we're going to build [12:44] distance [12:46] wrong [12:47] and so there i mark the wrong i adjust [12:49] and i release [12:51] yes [12:55] wrong [12:58] come on [12:59] good [13:02] wrong [13:04] good [13:07] and since she's having issues with me [13:09] marking and rewarding i can continue to [13:11] work on that or i could just start [13:13] building duration and then using my [13:15] terminal marker if you're gonna do that [13:18] make sure you use the terminal marker at [13:20] different points don't do it at the [13:21] exact same point each time meaning don't [13:23] walk away five feet and use the terminal [13:25] marker and do that every time because [13:27] then your dog is going to anticipate it [13:29] same thing don't walk away and walk back [13:31] and use your terminal marker each time i [13:33] should have corrected that [13:34] or else your dog is going to think oh [13:35] once you come next to me then you're [13:37] going to use the terminal marker so you [13:38] want to make sure you use it at [13:39] different points i could try to see if i [13:41] could do a couple more yes [13:46] yes [13:50] and this is good she's a little rusty on [13:52] this exercise yes [13:57] and i could have adjusted that as well [14:00] now when you return when the judge tells [14:02] you to return you have to go around your [14:05] dog so when i first start teaching this [14:07] i like to make a very wide circle either [14:10] you have a couple options now when i [14:12] first start doing it sit [14:14] i'll have the dog in a sit and i'll walk [14:16] around them like this [14:17] and i'll give them the food so they get [14:19] used to seeing me walk around them so [14:21] again i'll give them food as i walk [14:23] around [14:25] just getting them used to seeing that [14:26] pitcher it's much harder in the stand [14:28] though so we're going to tell her [14:31] and i'm going to use the other command [14:32] again that she doesn't know yet post [14:34] which she's already starting to learn [14:36] okay [14:37] and i'm going to build [14:40] progress by making a large circle so by [14:42] making a large circle [14:44] it's easier [14:46] for the dog to maintain position and we [14:48] also want to step into position and walk [14:50] away we don't want to get into position [14:52] and then release our dog each time [14:54] because that goes back to that [14:55] predictability or that pattern [14:56] recognition because when you are testing [14:58] and you come around [15:02] your dog must maintain the position [15:04] wrong [15:05] see like right there [15:06] we would have lost some points [15:12] good [15:15] your dog has to maintain the position [15:17] until you are told by the judge that the [15:19] exercise is finished [15:21] wrong [15:27] wrong [15:31] good [15:35] yes [15:40] and again [15:41] do a nice wide wrong [15:47] good girl [15:53] good [15:55] wrong [15:58] good girl [16:01] she's doing more movement than i would [16:03] like but again this is something you [16:04] have to wrong [16:07] continually work on [16:10] good wrong [16:24] so there's a little bit of movement [16:25] there [16:27] and don't stress this exercise out too [16:30] much if your dog makes a mistake you [16:32] should be ready for it because your dog [16:33] is going to make mistakes especially in [16:35] the beginning [16:36] i haven't worked this exercise with ari [16:38] in a long time so it's good for you to [16:41] be able to see the mistakes and how [16:43] we're able to adjust it yes so she's [16:45] holding it nicely so i'm going to reward [16:47] that [16:48] and i'm going to go back to walking [16:49] around [16:58] so i noticed that she's having the issue [17:00] so i'm going to work on making the [17:02] circle a little bit wider [17:11] and this is an exercise i would [17:13] recommend doing you want to be able to [17:14] get to the point where you can have your [17:15] dog in a stand stay you can walk around [17:17] you can go into heel position and you [17:19] can leave your dog again when you leave [17:21] your dog you can work on practicing [17:23] those three paces in order to get six [17:26] feet approximately away from your dog [17:27] which you'd have to do in the [17:28] competition so we're going to try again [17:40] good girl [17:43] wrong [17:45] come here sweetie [17:47] good girl [17:50] good girl [17:53] wrong [17:56] good [18:06] wrong [18:21] free very nice [18:24] and you're also going to want to work on [18:26] practicing having your dog in heel [18:28] position all right heel [18:30] and from here telling her [18:35] telling and you're going to be doing [18:37] this exercise when you compete without a [18:38] leash so you can use a leash during your [18:41] training but you're going to have to get [18:42] to a point where your dog can do it [18:43] without the leash so we can give our dog [18:45] the stand command stand [18:48] and you're allowed to adjust your dog [18:51] after they stand [18:53] once your dog is in the position that [18:55] you want [18:57] then you're gonna leave your dog when [18:58] the judge tells you to [18:59] one two three [19:02] turn and face [19:03] the judge is going to come up and [19:05] they're going to [19:06] pet the top of your dog [19:08] the back and rear end once they do that [19:12] then they're going to ask you to return [19:13] so it's going to be very helpful to have [19:15] other people help you with this exercise [19:18] you want a bunch of different people [19:19] coming up and petting your dog in this [19:21] manner so your dog is going to be [19:23] generalized to the training and you'll [19:24] be successful when you go to compete so [19:26] when they do come to practice it they [19:28] have to touch the top of the dog's head [19:30] wrong [19:31] come on baby [19:35] top of the dog's head they're back and [19:37] their back end [19:39] and you don't want them moving their [19:41] feet so she's not doing as good of a job [19:42] as i would like but [19:45] and that's pretty much how they're gonna [19:46] do it [19:48] wrong [19:52] good [19:55] so they will come up [19:58] pet [19:59] walk away wrong [20:02] come here sweetie good girl [20:05] very good [20:08] and i'm kind of progressing through this [20:10] pretty quickly for the demonstration [20:11] purposes if you're noticing you're [20:13] having a hard time with certain steps [20:15] make sure you take enough time to get [20:17] your dog proficient at it before trying [20:18] to move on to the more difficult [20:20] portions of the exercise so i really [20:22] wouldn't want to be doing the petting [20:23] just yet because she is having some [20:24] issues right now but that is going to be [20:27] the type of petting that you would want [20:29] to work on when you're training for this [20:30] exercise all right so we're going to [20:32] give our dog stand [20:35] i helped her out a little bit with the [20:36] leash make sure the positioning looks [20:38] good [20:39] and again you can adjust just make sure [20:41] you always double check the rule book [20:42] that you're doing everything according [20:44] to the rules they tell you to leave [20:46] one two three turn and face your dog [20:51] they're gonna come up [20:54] pet [20:56] after they pet [20:57] they're going to tell you to return [21:05] exercise finished [21:08] this is a difficult exercise we want to [21:10] continue to work on that stand stay with [21:12] all kinds of different distractions make [21:14] your stance stay as strong [21:16] as possible get your dog used to the [21:18] adjustments that you need to make with [21:20] the leash pressure get them good at [21:22] being lured into the stand position as [21:24] well as going around into the heel [21:26] position and leaving it again you don't [21:28] want your dog to think just because [21:29] you're coming into the heel position [21:31] that the exercise is going to be [21:32] finished also like i said you have to [21:34] have multiple multiple people acting as [21:37] the judge so your dog can get used to [21:39] different people coming up and petting [21:41] them while they're maintaining that [21:42] stance stay and then of course when you [21:44] get back into position you can call your [21:46] dog in the heel or tell them sit [21:48] whatever it is that you want to work on [21:50] but remember your dog has to maintain [21:52] that standing position until the judge [21:54] tells you exercise finished [22:13] you ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 319/841,com on the [02:16] homepage you'll see a logo with the [02:18] words dog training in bold with [02:20] obedience and behavioral modification [02:23] training plan click here below it when [02:25] you click on that link it'll take you to [02:27] the flowchart now if you notice you'll [02:29] see questions that are in bold font [02:32] these refer to the possible issues that [02:34] you may be having you'll also see option [02:37] 1 and option 2 underlined option 1 will [02:40] be for those of you that prefer not to [02:42] give your dog any kind of correction for [02:45] option 2 we'll be implementing a [02:46] correction to stop the undesired [02:49] behavior when it comes to working with [02:50] our dogs we have two main issues to work [02:53] through obedience issues and behavioral [02:56] issues we'll start with behavioral [02:58] issues the first one is your dog [03:01] practicing a dangerous or destructive [03:03] behavior [03:04] if yes then we have two options option [03:07] one prevent the dog from practicing the [03:09] behavior meaning you have to either put [03:11] up some sort of boundary or barrier or [03:14] you have to stop the dog every time they [03:16] do the behavior until they eventually [03:18] stop trying for example if your dog [03:20] chews on furniture you either have to [03:22] stop the dog every time they chew on the [03:24] furniture or you can prevent the dog [03:26] from even getting to the furniture in [03:28] addition you could use something like [03:31] dog's bitter apple no chew spray but i [03:34] prefer to go with option two which is [03:37] you can use a correction immediately to [03:39] stop dangerous or destructive behaviors [03:42] for example if your dog digs then you [03:45] can correct that behavior out of your [03:47] dog's repertoire but you have to be sure [03:49] to correct your dog when they are [03:51] digging not hours after the hole has [03:54] already been dug [03:56] next is the behavior based on fear if [03:59] yes then you'll want to implement [04:01] counter conditioning and desensitization [04:04] click on that blue link to learn how is [04:06] the behavior based on aggression [04:09] aggression is a very complicated issue [04:12] so i made a video dedicated to that [04:14] subject just click on the video link to [04:16] see that episode [04:18] is it a behavior you just don't want the [04:20] dog to perform such as jumping up on [04:23] furniture or going into an unauthorized [04:25] room such as a baby's room or an office [04:28] if yes then have you already trained [04:30] your dog and conditioned them to the [04:32] continuation and terminal marker if not [04:35] watch the two videos below and teach [04:37] your dog the markers and don't just skip [04:39] to the last step if you want to be [04:41] successful with your dog then it's [04:43] essential to make sure that you do the [04:44] required training for each step of the [04:47] training process here's an analogy to [04:50] put it into perspective if you stepped [04:52] on glass and cut your foot open you [04:54] wouldn't just put a band-aid on it and [04:55] call it a day no you would remove the [04:58] glass clean and stitch the wound and [05:00] then you would put on the bandage it's [05:02] the same when we're working with our [05:04] dogs we have to be sure to complete each [05:06] step before moving on to the next one [05:09] now [05:10] if your dog is already conditioned to [05:12] the markers or after you've taught your [05:14] dog the markers then we can move on to [05:16] the next step does the dog know and [05:19] understand how to follow a lure if yes [05:22] move on to the next question if no then [05:24] watch the three videos below and teach [05:27] your dog how to effectively follow [05:29] allure once that's completed does your [05:31] dog know and understand leash pressure [05:33] if yes move on to the next question if [05:36] not then watch these two videos and [05:38] teach your dog leash pressure before [05:40] moving on you want to make sure that [05:42] your dog is so conditioned to the leash [05:45] pressure that your dog will respond [05:48] before there is any pressure on the [05:50] leash this is why i often say that it [05:52] should be called a leash cue instead [05:55] check out this video i made for a client [05:57] a few months back to see what i mean [06:00] all right so basically what i was [06:01] telling you guys about what we're having [06:03] our session is [06:04] the telegraphing or letting your dog [06:06] know what you're about to do so watch [06:07] for example how i do the cumberland call [06:09] using the leash pressure i start to walk [06:12] out the leash [06:13] see that cues him to come and fall same [06:15] thing when i start to lift up you see [06:17] how he's doing it before [06:20] okay now he's a little slow on that one [06:23] but watch how i walk up the leash [06:25] this is letting him know i'm about to do [06:27] the leash pressure just like lifting my [06:29] foot up is letting him know i'm about to [06:31] do the leash pressure same thing when i [06:33] walk back [06:35] slowly walking up the leash good [06:38] to cue him [06:40] on what i want him to do so by [06:42] telegraphing the beach pressure [06:44] it makes it much easier [06:47] for your dog to learn and respond [06:49] correctly to that pressure this is how i [06:51] like a dog to respond to the leash [06:53] pressure before i start correcting them [06:55] for refusing to respond to the leash [06:57] pressure one more time if it's further [07:00] down i'm lifting my leg up the dog sees [07:02] that and responds [07:04] i start walking up the leash and walking [07:06] towards the dog to get him to sit [07:08] walking back and walking up the leash to [07:10] come to me so super simple [07:13] has a dog been taught that the behavior [07:15] is not okay with leash pressure if not [07:17] then watch the three videos below to [07:19] learn how if yes then you can implement [07:21] either option one or two option one [07:25] continue using leash pressure to prevent [07:27] the dog from practicing the behavior or [07:28] prevent the possibility of the dog [07:30] practicing the behavior [07:32] option two you can use corrections to [07:34] stop these behaviors for example if your [07:37] dog jumps on the sofa the moment they [07:39] jump on the sofa you would say no and [07:42] then you would correct your dog with the [07:43] training collar after the correction you [07:45] will give the command you want your dog [07:47] to perform such as off if your dog still [07:51] doesn't perform the behavior you will [07:53] then use leash pressure to remove the [07:55] dog from the couch [07:56] now for obedience issues the first and [07:59] most common is your dog refusing to [08:01] perform a commanded behavior if yes then [08:05] does the dog know his continuation in [08:07] terminal marker if not then watch these [08:10] videos if yes does the dog know and [08:12] understand how to follow allure if not [08:14] then watch these videos if yes then does [08:17] your dog know and understand leash [08:20] pressure if not watch these videos if [08:23] yes then have you taught your dog the [08:25] verbal command by saying the command [08:27] first and then presenting the physical [08:29] cue meaning your dog will perform the [08:32] behavior on the verbal command alone and [08:34] you no longer have to assist with the [08:37] physical cue if not then watch these [08:40] videos if yes then move on to option one [08:43] or option two option one when the dog [08:46] chooses not to perform the command [08:48] within the first second say wrong then [08:50] use the leash pressure to make the dog [08:52] comply [08:53] option two if you give your dog a [08:55] command and they choose not to perform [08:57] that command the moment they decide they [08:59] aren't going to execute the command you [09:01] will say no [09:03] and then you will correct your dog with [09:05] the training collar [09:06] after the correction you will give the [09:09] command to your dog again if your dog [09:11] still doesn't perform the behavior you [09:13] will then use the leash pressure or [09:16] luring to place your dog into that [09:18] position [09:19] and last but not least does your dog [09:22] refuse to stay in a commanded stay if [09:24] yes then does the dog know his [09:27] continuation and terminal marker if not [09:29] watch these videos if yes does the dog [09:32] know and understand how to follow allure [09:34] if not watch these videos if yes then [09:37] does the dog know and understand leash [09:39] pressure if not watch these videos if [09:42] yes then have you taught the verbal [09:44] command for the position the dog is in [09:46] such as a sit stay the dog must know the [09:49] sit command on the verbal sit by saying [09:52] the command first and then presenting [09:54] the physical cue meaning your dog will [09:57] perform the behavior on the verbal [09:58] command alone and you no longer have to [10:01] assist the dog with the physical cue if [10:04] not then watch these videos if yes then [10:07] has the dog been taught that breaking [10:09] the stay is not allowed with leash [10:11] pressure [10:12] if not then watch these videos if yes [10:14] then if your dog breaks a stay and you [10:17] say wrong does your dog freeze in place [10:19] or go back to the previous position if [10:22] not then continue the last step until [10:24] your dog does if yes then you move on to [10:27] option one or option two option one when [10:30] your dog breaks the position you will [10:32] calmly say wrong [10:33] casually walk to your dog grab the leash [10:36] and use the leash pressure to place your [10:38] dog back into the position that was just [10:40] broken once your dog is back into the [10:42] desired position you will praise and pet [10:45] your dog petting is optional but don't [10:47] give your dog a treat or toy reward the [10:50] reason for this is that some dogs will [10:52] break the position on purpose so they [10:54] can get the reward when placed back into [10:56] the state position [10:58] option two when your dog breaks the [11:00] position you will say no but instead of [11:02] using leash pressure you'll give your [11:03] dog a correction with the training [11:04] collar even if the dog goes back into [11:06] the position on their own after you give [11:08] the physical correction you will then [11:10] command your dog back into the position [11:12] that was just broken if your dog fails [11:14] to do it on their own after the [11:15] correction you will assist them with the [11:18] leash pressure or luring you don't want [11:21] to continue to correct a dog for the [11:22] same mistake over and over again [11:25] once your dog is back into the desired [11:27] position you will praise and pet your [11:29] dog again petting is optional [11:31] but just like last time don't give your [11:33] dog a toy or a treat reward the reason [11:36] for this is that some dogs will break [11:37] the position on purpose so they can get [11:40] the reward when placed back into the [11:42] stay command [11:43] i hope everyone enjoys today's video and [11:46] it proves to be helpful let me know what [11:47] you think about it in the comments below [11:49] if you have any

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 322/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in the last akc novice video we covered [00:02] the stand for examination the next one [00:04] on the list would be the heal free [00:06] portion however this exercise is [00:08] performed in the same manner as the [00:10] helon leash and figure eight that we [00:11] covered about a month ago just without [00:13] the leash or the figure eight in fact [00:15] the scoring and orders will be the same [00:18] as well so instead of working on that [00:21] we're going to be moving forward and [00:22] working on the recall portion of the akc [00:25] novice as defined by the akc the [00:28] principal features of this exercise are [00:30] that the dogs stay were left until [00:32] called by the handler and that the dog [00:34] responds promptly to the handler's [00:36] command or signal to come at the start [00:39] of this exercise you will be standing [00:41] with your dog sitting in proper heel [00:43] position at the place designated by the [00:46] judge the judge will ask are you ready [00:49] once you confirm that you're ready you [00:51] will then be ordered by the judge [00:53] leave your dog [00:55] as the handler you may give a command a [00:58] command and a signal [01:00] or just a signal to the dog to stay in [01:02] the sit position [01:03] alternatively you can do what i like to [01:05] do and simply leave your dog without [01:07] saying anything at all [01:09] be aware that your dog will receive a [01:12] non-qualifying score in nq if you give [01:15] an additional command and or signal to [01:18] stay you'll also receive an enqueue if [01:20] your dog breaks the state command before [01:22] being called or signaled to come [01:25] you will then walk forward to the other [01:27] end of the ring turn and face your dog [01:29] you should be standing with your arms [01:31] and hands hanging naturally [01:34] once the judge signals you or tells you [01:36] to call your dog you will then give a [01:38] physical or verbal command to come your [01:41] dog must come directly to you at a brisk [01:43] trot or gallop and sit straight and [01:46] center [01:47] you will receive an enqueue if your dog [01:48] is not close enough that you can touch [01:50] your dog's head without excessive [01:52] bending stretching or moving either foot [01:55] and you can lose substantial points if [01:58] you have to give your dog an additional [01:59] command to sit once your dog gets to you [02:02] if your dog fails to remain sitting by [02:05] either standing or laying down [02:07] fails to come at a brisk trot or gallop [02:10] or fails to sit in front [02:13] once your dog is in the sit front [02:14] position you will then be told by the [02:16] judge to finish at this point you will [02:19] give your dog a command or signal to [02:21] flip into the heel position which is the [02:23] finish you can have your dog flip into [02:26] heel position or you can have your dog [02:27] go around you in the heel position [02:29] either is okay as long as it's done [02:31] without delay and the dog sits straight [02:33] in heel you can lose substantial points [02:36] if you have to give your dog an extra [02:37] command to finish if your dog fails to [02:39] remain sitting by standing or laying [02:42] down or fails to finish or sit in heel [02:45] and lastly minor or substantial [02:48] deductions will be made for slow or poor [02:51] sits for finishes that are not prompt or [02:53] smart if the dog touches you while [02:56] coming in to the sit front position or [02:59] if your dog touches you while going into [03:01] the heel position and for sitting [03:03] between your feet in order to [03:05] successfully complete this portion of [03:06] the akc novice your dog should know four [03:09] different exercise one your dog must [03:11] understand the heel position your dog [03:13] needs to know stay command your dog [03:15] should be able to be called into the sit [03:17] front position [03:18] and your dog should know a finish [03:20] whether it be a flip finish or a buy [03:22] finish [03:23] now i've already made detailed videos on [03:26] each of these topics and if you want to [03:28] see those as well which i would highly [03:29] recommend check out the episode links in [03:31] the description of this video [03:34] now that we know what's required let's [03:36] start training [03:37] come [03:40] i'm going to be doing today's video [03:42] slightly different than normal i want to [03:44] give everyone the opportunity to see how [03:45] a training session looks without me [03:47] explaining each step as i train i [03:50] thought this would give you a more [03:52] realistic example of what one of my [03:54] training sessions may look like [03:56] also keep in mind that this is [03:58] considered advanced training [04:00] if you want to see all the steps to get [04:02] to this point watch the videos in the [04:04] description of this episode now if you [04:07] noticed i started with my dog in the sit [04:09] front position the reason for this is [04:11] that i like to break it down to a format [04:13] that makes it easy for the dog to learn [04:15] what i'm trying to teach since this [04:17] exercise requires a nice sit front i [04:20] like to start with the recall exercise [04:22] from up close and gradually add more [04:24] distance to make the pitcher as clear as [04:26] possible for the dog i'm training [04:29] yes [04:34] sit [04:37] you may have noticed before stepping [04:38] back i repeated the sit command i do [04:41] that instead of saying stay and the [04:43] reason for this is when i teach a dog [04:45] stay i don't say stay if i put a dog [04:48] into a commanded position the stay is [04:50] implied so if i tell a dog down and they [04:53] go into the down position they are now [04:54] in a down stay same thing with the sit [04:57] if i say sit that's letting the dog know [04:59] they are in a sit stay just giving my [05:01] dog a little bit of feedback before [05:03] continuing on with the exercise [05:06] come [05:08] yes very nice sorry [05:12] sit [05:17] come [05:19] if i notice that the dog is starting to [05:20] come in slightly crooked i'll step back [05:22] as part of the physical cue to get my [05:24] dog to come in as straight as possible [05:26] if you remember from my how to teach [05:28] your dog to come when called episode the [05:30] physical cue for the recall command is [05:32] to back up and lure the dog into the [05:34] perfect sit front position [05:36] this is a version of what's known as [05:38] fading this means that we are presenting [05:40] the physical cube but with less movement [05:43] each time until the q is no longer [05:45] needed [05:46] yes [05:50] back [05:54] break [05:57] i was hoping that the back command would [05:59] get her to walk straight back to the [06:01] start point but she was going off a [06:02] little bit to the side so i released her [06:04] with my release word which is break and [06:06] it's a release word because it doesn't [06:08] predict a reward it simply releases the [06:10] dog from whatever exercise i have them [06:12] in or position i have them in and now [06:13] i'm just going to bring her back into [06:15] the starting position and do a couple [06:16] more reps [06:18] sit [06:25] come [06:27] yes very nice [06:31] sit [06:38] come [06:43] on the last recall when she sat in the [06:44] sit front position she was crooked so i [06:47] simply took a step back to help her [06:48] straighten out yes [06:50] excellent [06:53] break [07:00] sit [07:07] come [07:10] yes [07:11] excellent [07:16] sit [07:24] come [07:26] yes [07:33] bye [07:36] yes [07:38] since she came in nice and straight on [07:39] that last recall i didn't have to make [07:41] any adjustments then when i called her [07:43] into heel i used the buy finish instead [07:45] of the flip finish i went with the buy [07:47] finish because she has a tendency to [07:49] bump into me more when i ask her to [07:51] perform the flip finish i also helped [07:53] her with a slight cue with my right hand [07:55] and i used a little bit of luring with [07:57] my left hand to help make sure she was [08:00] nice and straight [08:02] sit [08:03] wrong [08:05] sit [08:08] right there she went into the down [08:10] position instead of staying in the sit [08:12] when she made the mistake i said wrong [08:14] which means stop what you're doing or go [08:16] back into the previous position we do [08:18] this by using leash pressure after we [08:21] say wrong to show the dog what we would [08:23] like them to do instead in this [08:25] situation i'm basically treating the [08:28] word wrong or that marker as a [08:29] non-reinforcement marker which lets the [08:32] dog know that they made a mistake but [08:34] they could try again [08:38] come [08:40] yes [08:44] sit [08:52] come yes [09:00] bye [09:02] yes [09:06] sit [09:09] when i step out of the heel position and [09:11] i want the dog to stay i will either say [09:13] sit or i'll say nothing at all also [09:16] notice that i stepped with my right foot [09:18] i do that to give the dog one more [09:20] additional cue that i want them to stay [09:21] in that position if i wanted the dog to [09:23] step with me i would say heal before i [09:26] step and i would step off with my left [09:29] foot instead [09:30] come [09:34] bye [09:39] free very nice sorry [09:42] excellent work come on baby [09:44] very good [09:48] yes [09:55] sit yes [10:07] yes [10:09] very good [10:13] when working with your dog make sure [10:15] you're not pattern training too much i [10:17] started to notice that i was calling her [10:19] to me every time so this time instead of [10:22] the recall i marked her staying with yes [10:25] and then i gave her a reward this will [10:28] help prevent her from anticipating the [10:30] recall and coming to me before i call [10:32] her [10:35] come [10:39] bye [10:43] free [10:44] very nice sorry that's my good girl [10:48] and that's it a nice short and fun [10:50] session always remember to end your [10:53] training on a good note and when your [10:54] dog is still having fun don't make the [10:56] mistake of training for too long which [10:58] could make the session boring and would [11:01] cause your dog to lose interest stick [11:03] around if you want to watch this session [11:05] without the commentary [11:09] come [11:12] yes [11:17] sit [11:21] come [11:23] yes very nice sorry [11:27] sit [11:32] come [11:35] yes [11:39] back [11:43] break [11:47] sit [11:54] come [11:56] yes very nice [12:00] sit [12:07] come [12:12] yes [12:12] excellent [12:15] break [12:23] sit [12:29] come [12:33] yes [12:34] excellent [12:38] sit [12:46] come [12:49] yes [12:56] bye [12:59] yes [13:00] sit [13:01] wrong [13:04] sit [13:09] come [13:12] yes [13:15] sit [13:22] come [13:25] yes [13:32] bye [13:34] yes [13:37] sit [13:47] come [13:51] bye [13:56] free very nice sorry [13:59] excellent work come on baby very good [14:05] yes [14:12] sit yes [14:16] sit [14:24] yes [14:26] very good [14:41] come [14:46] bye [14:50] free [14:51] very nice sorry that's my good girl [14:56] thanks again for watching and i hope [14:57] everyone enjoyed today's

[00:31] confirmed that you're ready the judge [00:33] will tell you to sit your dog even [00:35] though your dog should already be [00:37] sitting [00:38] you may command and or signal the dog to [00:40] sit without touching either the dog or [00:43] the dog's collar the next order from the [00:46] judge will be leave your dog to get your [00:48] leash at this point you can give a [00:51] command and or signal to stay i like to [00:54] either repeat the sick command to the [00:55] dog or say nothing at all for some dogs [00:58] adding a signal with the command can [01:01] often help [01:02] then you will walk forward directly to [01:04] the place designated by the judge for [01:06] the leash grab the leash and then turn [01:09] and face your dog you'll then receive [01:10] the order back to your dog from the [01:13] judge at this point you'll walk directly [01:15] to your dog walking around and in back [01:18] of the dog into the heel position [01:20] once you're in the heel position and [01:21] your dog hasn't moved the judge will say [01:24] exercise exercised finished followed by [01:27] clip your leash to the collar and [01:29] maintain control of your dog at this [01:31] point you are required to exit the ring [01:33] with your dog under control this means [01:36] without jumping [01:37] pulling or tugging on the leash [01:40] judging procedures prior to the start of [01:42] judging the judge will instruct the [01:44] steward where to place the leash after [01:46] the heal on leash and figure 8 exercise [01:48] the leash will be placed inside the ring [01:50] near the gate entrance on a chair or [01:52] similar leash holder the handler and dog [01:54] will be positioned at least 30 feet from [01:57] and facing the direction of the gate [01:59] entrance the judge must be in position [02:01] to watch the dog and handler throughout [02:03] the exercise including exiting the ring [02:07] now let's discuss the scoring all of the [02:10] following will result in a [02:11] non-qualifying score an nq one if your [02:15] dog moves a substantial distance away [02:18] from the place where it was left [02:20] two if your dog does not remain in the [02:22] sit position until you return to heal [02:24] three if your dog repeatedly barks or [02:28] whines [02:29] the following will result in a loss of [02:31] some or a considerable amount of points [02:34] the scoring starts with the first order [02:36] sit your dog one if you are rough with [02:39] your dog [02:40] extreme cases the dog may be released [02:43] two if you receive resistance from your [02:46] dog in an attempt to make them sit again [02:49] extreme cases the dog may be released [02:52] three if your dog moves a short distance [02:55] from where they were left [02:57] four if your dog barks or whines only [02:59] once or twice [03:01] five if your dog changes from the sit [03:03] position after you have returned to the [03:06] heel position and before the judge says [03:08] exercise finished and last but not least [03:12] six [03:13] under miscellaneous penalties if your [03:15] dog does not remain under control as you [03:18] leave the ring [03:19] now let's cover the group exercise sit [03:21] and down stay as defined by the akc the [03:24] principal feature of this exercise is [03:26] that the dog remains in the sitting or [03:28] down position whichever is required at [03:31] the time in order to participate in this [03:34] group exercise your dog must [03:35] successfully qualify during the [03:37] individual exercises in addition when [03:39] the judge asks you if you'll be [03:41] returning for the group exercise you [03:43] must confirm that you will be if you [03:45] tell the judge that you will not be [03:47] returning you will not be able to change [03:49] your mind on that [03:50] this exercise will be performed on a [03:53] six-foot leash that will remain clipped [03:55] to the dog's collar and in your hand [03:57] throughout the entire exercise [03:59] at the start of the exercise the judge [04:01] will ask [04:02] are you ready once everyone is ready the [04:04] judge will order sit your dogs and at [04:07] that point you will command and or [04:09] signal your dog to sit without touching [04:11] your dog or the collar next the judge [04:13] will order leave your dogs again you can [04:16] give a command and or signal to stay [04:19] then you will walk to the end of your [04:20] leash turn and face your dog and make [04:24] sure you don't accidentally jerk or [04:25] tighten the leash during this it's [04:27] important that you maintain a loose [04:29] leash throughout the entire exercise [04:31] after a minute the judge will order back [04:33] to your dogs at this point you will [04:35] return directly to your dog by walking [04:37] around them into the heel position your [04:40] dog needs to maintain the sit stay until [04:42] the judge says exercise finished [04:46] again before starting the downstate [04:48] portion of this exercise the judge will [04:50] ask are you ready once everyone is ready [04:52] the judge will order down your dogs at [04:55] this point you will command and or [04:58] signal your dog to down without touching [05:00] your dog or your dog's collar next the [05:03] judge will order leave your dogs again [05:05] you can give a command and or signal to [05:07] stay then you will walk to the end of [05:09] your leash turn and face your dog once [05:12] again making sure you don't accidentally [05:14] jerk or tighten the leash after a minute [05:16] the judge will order back to your dogs [05:19] at this point you will return directly [05:20] to your dog by walking around them into [05:23] the heel position your dog needs to [05:25] maintain the down stay until the judge [05:27] says exercise finished then the judge [05:30] will say maintain control your dogs [05:32] which at this point you are required to [05:34] exit the ring with your dog under [05:36] control this means without jumping [05:39] pulling or tugging on the leash judging [05:42] procedures if a judge observes any signs [05:45] of aggression or potential problems when [05:47] the dogs are being assembled outside of [05:49] the ring for the group exercise or once [05:51] the dogs are brought into the ring the [05:53] judge must excuse the dog and mark the [05:55] judge's book excused and state the [05:58] reason any handlers who physically [06:00] correct their dogs before or after the [06:02] group exercise or while exiting the ring [06:04] must be penalized under miscellaneous [06:07] penalties judges must stand with their [06:09] full attention on the dogs and handlers [06:12] during the group exercise and remain [06:14] alert to any potential problems to have [06:17] both dog and handler under constant [06:19] observation in this exercise a judge [06:22] should take a position slightly to the [06:24] rear of the dogs at one end of the row [06:26] of dogs [06:28] now for scoring all the following will [06:31] result in a non-qualifying score one if [06:34] your dog moves a substantial distance [06:36] away from the place where it was left [06:39] two if your dog does not remain in the [06:41] required position until you return to [06:43] heal [06:44] three if your dog repeatedly barks or [06:48] whines [06:49] the following will result in a loss of [06:51] some or a considerable amount of points [06:55] one if you have to reposition your dog [06:57] if it's out of position enough to [06:58] interfere with an adjacent dog in [07:00] extreme cases the dog may be released [07:03] two if your dog moves a short distance [07:05] from where it was left [07:06] three if your dog barks or whines only [07:09] once or twice [07:11] four [07:12] if your dog changes positions after you [07:14] have returned into the heel position and [07:16] before the judge says exercised finished [07:20] five if you jerk on or tighten the leash [07:23] before the judge says exercise finished [07:25] in extreme cases the dog may receive a [07:28] non-qualifying score [07:30] six touching the dog or its collar while [07:33] getting the dog into the sit or down [07:34] position [07:36] seven if you are rough with your dog [07:38] extreme cases the dog may be released [07:40] eight if you receive resistance from [07:43] your dog in an attempt to make it sit or [07:45] lie down and last but not least nine [07:49] under miscellaneous penalties if your [07:52] dog does not remain under control as you [07:54] leave the ring [07:56] okay now that we know the rules and the [07:58] regulations for this exercise let's [08:01] quickly discuss the training we will [08:03] need in order to be successful [08:05] first we want to make sure that our dog [08:07] has a strong sit and down stay with [08:10] distractions [08:11] second we also want to work on walking [08:13] around our dogs into the heel position [08:16] this is a very important part of the [08:18] exercise because dogs often want to [08:20] break the position as we walk around [08:21] them third we want to make sure that our [08:23] dogs can go into the sit and down [08:25] position while they're in the heel [08:27] position without the help of a physical [08:29] cue this is also very important because [08:31] dogs often want to swing to the sit [08:33] front position where they originally [08:34] learn the sit and down commands [08:37] fourth we want to teach our dogs to go [08:39] directly into heel or loose leash [08:41] exercise loose leash walking after the [08:44] stay this will help us maintain control [08:46] of our dogs as we exit the ring [08:49] alright let's get started [08:54] i'm going to start working on the sit [08:55] and down stay with distractions if the [08:58] dog breaks the position i will say one [09:00] wrong the moment the dog breaks then i [09:02] will calmly walk to the dog grab the [09:04] leash and place him back into the [09:05] position that was just broken we [09:07] continue to do this up until the point [09:09] where we can add all kinds of different [09:10] distractions and the dog maintains [09:13] either the sit stay or the down stay [09:20] yes [09:21] good job buddy [09:32] wrong [09:40] even though spock went back into the [09:42] down position when i said wrong which is [09:45] good because it shows us that spock [09:47] understands that wrong means to go back [09:49] into the previous position or stop what [09:51] they're doing i still went back to [09:53] adjust him since he moved from his [09:55] original position unfortunately after [09:57] watching the footage it's clear that i [09:59] didn't get him back to the exact [10:01] position he broke but it's okay we [10:03] continue to move forward with the [10:05] training [10:15] yes very good since he held the position [10:18] after i threw the bottle which by the [10:20] way is something that spock really [10:23] enjoys he likes trying to bite plastic [10:25] bottles this was a very difficult [10:28] distraction for him and since he [10:29] maintained it i marked with the yes and [10:31] then i'm going to go back and reward him [10:41] wrong [10:43] this is very common and it's something i [10:45] like to do when i'm working with the [10:46] down stay is to squat down the reason [10:49] why this is difficult for dogs is [10:50] because often when people call their [10:52] dogs to them they squat down so the dog [10:54] sees that as a physical cue for come [10:57] when called since we're trying to work [10:59] on him maintaining the position [11:01] regardless of the distractions it's good [11:03] to practice this so the moment i squat [11:05] it down he got up i said wrong which you [11:08] can see he's self-adjusted but now i'm [11:10] going to go back and i'm going to try to [11:11] place him back into the original [11:12] position that he had broken then we're [11:15] gonna try it again to see if he has [11:17] learned and understands that he needs to [11:19] maintain the position when i squat down [11:21] good boy [11:31] good [11:41] very good [11:47] yes [11:56] yes [11:57] now as you can see that time he did much [11:59] better he wanted to get up but he [12:02] learned from the previous training that [12:04] he needs to maintain the position and he [12:06] went back down before he actually ended [12:08] up making the mistake excellent [12:18] good boy very good [12:26] sit [12:27] good [12:28] yes [12:34] sit [12:35] wrong [12:39] this is a common issue as well often [12:41] dogs are so used to going into different [12:43] positions from one static position to [12:46] the next such as sit to a down down from [12:48] a sit stand from a down and once we give [12:51] them a command they think they have to [12:52] just go into a different position so he [12:54] made the mistake i said wrong use a [12:57] leash cue them back into the correct [12:58] position and right back into training [13:02] sit [13:04] and now we're simply going to work on [13:05] the exact same types of distractions [13:07] that we did while spock was in the down [13:09] but now instead we have them in the sit [13:11] stay [13:14] yes very good [13:24] wrong [13:28] good [13:36] another trick that i like to do when i'm [13:38] working on going around a dog as i step [13:40] around them i will feed them with my [13:42] left hand this keeps them distracted but [13:44] it also gets them used to a person [13:47] stepping around them without having to [13:49] look at them the entire time this is [13:52] very helpful considering when we do a [13:53] lot of engagement training we're [13:55] teaching our dogs to maintain constant [13:57] focus so for this they have to be okay [14:00] losing sight of you for a quick second [14:03] as you come around to get back into the [14:04] heel position so i'll do this over and [14:07] over again just to get my dog [14:08] comfortable with that movement [14:28] yes sit [14:31] wrong [14:40] wrong [14:46] sit [14:48] also if you notice your dog is having an [14:50] issue with a specific exercise or [14:52] command that you're trying to implement [14:54] don't avoid it instead work on it so [14:56] you're able to make the adjustments and [14:58] teach your dog what the correct action [14:59] is on his or her part here we noticed [15:02] that he was having an issue with me [15:04] saying sit as i stepped away to get him [15:07] to maintain the sit position he was [15:09] assuming that he needs to go into it [15:10] down so again i went over it multiple [15:13] times to get him to understand that when [15:15] i say sit and step away he simply has to [15:18] maintain the sit position yes [15:20] good boy [15:31] sit [15:32] very good [15:43] yes [15:52] yes [16:00] sit [16:07] now we're going to work on the actual [16:08] routine for the akc novice sit stay get [16:12] your leash remember before starting the [16:14] judge will ask are you ready once you [16:16] confirm that you're ready the judge will [16:18] tell you sit your dog then the judge [16:20] will tell you leave your dog to get your [16:22] leash at that point you will step away [16:25] you can command or signal to stay walk [16:27] toward the leashes grab it turn and face [16:30] your dog then you're going to wait until [16:32] the judge says back to your dog at that [16:34] point walk directly to your dog around [16:36] them into the heel position and the dog [16:39] must maintain that sit until the judge [16:41] says exercise finished followed by clip [16:44] your leash to the collar and maintain [16:46] control of your dog [16:58] then at this point you're gonna step off [17:00] with your dog maintaining the heel stay [17:02] very good good job buddy [17:05] excellent [17:07] down [17:09] yes [17:10] it's often good to give our dogs a [17:12] little bit of reminder training as well [17:15] so what i'm going to do right now with [17:16] spock is i'm simply going to have him in [17:18] heel position and i'm going to work the [17:20] sit and down while he maintains the heel [17:23] position at first i'm going to use a [17:25] lure notice that i give the command and [17:28] then i lure the dog into the position [17:30] once he's in the position i mark and [17:32] reward i'm going to do this a few times [17:34] then i'm going to do it with the leash [17:36] pressure cue after a couple reps of that [17:39] i'm going to ask him to do it without [17:41] any help at all let's see how he does [17:42] excellent good [17:45] sit [17:46] yes very good buddy [17:50] down [17:51] yes good [17:54] sit [17:56] yes [17:57] very good [18:01] down [18:03] yes [18:04] good [18:06] sit [18:07] yes [18:09] good boy [18:12] down [18:14] yes [18:15] excellent [18:18] sit [18:20] yes very good [18:25] down [18:27] yes [18:31] sit [18:33] yes [18:34] excellent good job buddy [18:41] now we're going to work on the actual [18:42] sit and down stay as though it's being [18:45] conducted in the akc novice now [18:48] unfortunately we don't have a bunch of [18:49] other dogs to help with that added [18:51] distraction but it is good to give your [18:53] dog this picture and to do this training [18:55] in multiple environments to help them [18:57] become generalized remember the judge [18:59] will ask are you ready once everyone is [19:01] ready the judge will tell you sit your [19:03] dogs once every dog is sitting then the [19:06] judge will say leave your dogs you will [19:08] step out in front of your dog at the end [19:11] of the six foot leash turn and face your [19:13] dog after a minute you will be ordered [19:15] back to your dog remember you have to go [19:18] around your dog back into the heel [19:20] position the dog must maintain the sit [19:22] until the judge says exercise finished [19:25] it's going to be the exact same process [19:27] for the downstay the judge is going to [19:29] ask everyone are you ready once [19:31] everyone's ready he will tell you to [19:33] down your dog once your dog is in the [19:35] down then the judge will tell everyone [19:37] leave your dogs walk straight forward in [19:39] front of your dog at the end of the six [19:41] foot leash turn and face your dog you [19:43] will wait a minute until the judge says [19:45] back to your dogs which at that point [19:47] you will walk around them into the heel [19:49] position and the dog must maintain the [19:51] down stay until the judge says exercise [19:54] finished then the judge will say [19:56] maintain control of your dog which at [19:58] that point you are required to exit the [20:00] ring with your dog under control so as i [20:02] said it's good to practice going right [20:04] into loose leash walking or a heel [20:07] command after practicing this exercise [20:09] thanks again for watching i hope [20:11] everyone enjoyed today's episode don't [20:13] forget to hit

must understand that everything [00:21] our dogs do is based on motivation [00:23] they're either motivated to access [00:25] something pleasant they're motivated to [00:27] prevent something unpleasant or the [00:29] behavior itself is fun this is what's [00:31] known as a self-reinforcing behavior [00:33] next is understanding timing when our [00:36] dogs do a behavior we have one second to [00:38] let them know if we would like them to [00:40] repeat that behavior or one second to [00:42] let them know if we would not like them [00:44] to repeat that behavior let's say we ask [00:46] our dog to sit the moment the dog's butt [00:48] hits the ground the timer starts within [00:51] that first second we have to either give [00:53] the dog the primary reinforcer which is [00:55] food toy or affection or we can give the [00:58] dog the condition reinforcer also known [01:01] as a marker which is a sound such as a [01:03] click or the word yes that predicts a [01:06] reward [01:07] if we use a condition reinforcer we must [01:10] pay our dogs with the primary this is [01:12] the same as money for humans money is [01:14] only valuable because it always predicts [01:17] a primary our markers to our dogs will [01:20] only be valuable if they always predict [01:22] the primary each word only has value to [01:25] our dogs based on what that word [01:26] predicts this comes from the studies [01:28] that were conducted by pavlov he found [01:30] that if the same sound always preceded a [01:33] reward the dogs would eventually begin [01:35] to salivate when they heard that sound [01:38] before the food was present this is what [01:40] he called classical conditioning also [01:42] known as the dinner bell theory however [01:45] if the sound came while the food was [01:47] being delivered [01:49] yes [01:53] three [01:54] or if the sound came while the dogs were [01:56] eating [01:58] yes [02:03] free [02:04] they would never become classically [02:06] conditioned we have to keep this in mind [02:08] when we are conditioning our dogs to our [02:10] markers again also known as condition [02:13] reinforcers we make the sound then we [02:15] deliver the reward after enough [02:17] repetitions your dogs will become [02:19] conditioned to the sound and you will [02:21] then be able to use this in your [02:22] training [02:23] so let's go back to the sit if you give [02:26] your dog the primary within the first [02:28] second then you have effectively shown [02:30] your dog that it's a behavior that you [02:31] would like [02:32] but what if you use the condition [02:34] reinforcer how long would you have to [02:36] deliver the primary before you lost the [02:38] connection well you have as long as a [02:41] dog is paying attention such as in this [02:43] video you can see i give my dog ari the [02:45] sick command the moment her butt hits [02:47] the ground i say the yes marker then i [02:50] start to walk towards my dog grabbing a [02:52] treat and handing it to her and you can [02:55] see she's focused on me the entire time [02:57] and now even though that reward came way [02:59] after the behavior i was trying to [03:01] capture my dog knows whatever she was [03:04] doing when she heard the sound is what [03:06] she's being rewarded for once we [03:08] understand this then we are ready to put [03:10] it all together let's picture the four [03:13] steps on a timeline the first step is [03:15] the command this can be physical or a [03:18] verbal command [03:19] the second is the motivation this is the [03:21] physical cue that gets the dog to do the [03:24] behavior the third step is to either [03:26] mark or reward if you use the primary in [03:29] this step then the process is complete [03:31] if you use the marker then you must move [03:33] on to the last step which is giving your [03:36] dog the primary reward now when teaching [03:38] this process to a dog we must start at [03:40] the end and work our way forward first [03:43] we must find a treat that our dog enjoys [03:46] then we have to condition our dogs to [03:48] the markers as explained earlier this is [03:50] known as loading the markers and it's [03:52] also known as engagement training [03:55] next we have to show our dogs what we [03:57] would like them to perform with a [03:58] physical cue it doesn't matter if you're [04:01] teaching a sit or something more [04:02] complicated like ringing a bell you must [04:04] first find a way to get the dog to do [04:07] the behavior every time with the [04:09] physical cue [04:10] once you've completed that step then you [04:12] can move on to the last step which is [04:14] giving the behavior a command remember [04:16] the command can be verbal or it could be [04:18] physical [04:19] as you can see on the timeline you can [04:21] now give the command follow it with the [04:23] physical cue then the reward or marker [04:26] and finally the reward if you use the [04:28] marker [04:29] now you will repeat this process as many [04:31] times as it takes for your dog to do the [04:34] behavior on the command alone so you [04:36] deliver the command and before you're [04:38] even able to give the dog the physical [04:40] cue they are already doing the behavior [04:42] now it doesn't matter if you're training [04:44] for competition obedience basic [04:46] obedience or anything in between the [04:49] process is always the same and if you [04:51] can understand the science you can [04:53] master the art [04:57] today we are talking about markers this [04:59] is probably one of the most important [05:01] things when it comes to training and [05:02] working with our dogs now a marker is a [05:05] condition reinforcer it has been [05:07] conditioned to be reinforcing now we [05:09] call it a marker because it signifies [05:11] that we are marking a moment in time [05:13] when our dogs are right or wrong and we [05:15] use markers because it's been [05:16] scientifically proven that we have [05:18] approximately one second give or take [05:20] depending on the dog to let them know [05:22] when they're doing a behavior we're [05:24] trying to capture whether or not it's [05:25] something we would like them to repeat [05:27] or it's something we would not like them [05:29] to repeat and in order for a marker to [05:31] be a marker it must predict one of the [05:34] four quadrants of opera conditioning now [05:36] what are the four quadrants of opera [05:37] conditioning well it's positive [05:39] reinforcement negative reinforcement [05:41] positive punishment and negative [05:43] punishment now this is what helps us [05:45] create what's known as an opera dog and [05:47] that is a dog that understands that [05:49] their behavior has an effect on their [05:51] environment so the dog starts to [05:52] understand that they can make good [05:54] things happen as well as bad things [05:56] happen and when we train a dog this way [05:58] we create an incredibly confident [06:00] motivated dog that knows how to navigate [06:02] within our world in ways that other dogs [06:04] don't so first we have to condition our [06:07] dog to the markers but before we do that [06:09] i want to explain what each one of the [06:11] four quadrants are very quickly this [06:13] often confuses people because they think [06:15] positive means good and negative means [06:17] bad well that's not what we're talking [06:19] about when we are using positive or [06:21] negative reinforcement positive or [06:22] negative punishment but instead positive [06:25] means adding to the equation whereas [06:27] negative means taking away reinforcement [06:29] means encouraging a behavior to be [06:31] repeated and punishment means preventing [06:33] a behavior from being repeated so [06:35] positive reinforcement anything we add [06:37] to the equation to reinforce a behavior [06:39] to get the repeat of a behavior if we [06:41] tell our dog good boy or good girl we [06:43] give them a treat a toy we pet them [06:46] anything we add that they see as [06:48] valuable in order to get them to repeat [06:50] a behavior so then what's negative [06:52] reinforcement negative reinforcement is [06:54] not what you think it's not a punishment [06:56] it's not a correction remember [06:57] reinforcement means encouraging a [06:59] behavior to be repeated so negative [07:02] reinforcement we take something away to [07:04] reinforce a behavior this means when we [07:06] turn on pressure this is used when we [07:08] use leash pressure training with our [07:10] dogs but we turn pressure on and when [07:12] the dog complies we turn the pressure [07:14] off that's the negative if you've ever [07:16] taken your hand and pushed it on your [07:18] dog's rear end to get your dog to sit [07:20] and your dog sits and you remove your [07:22] hand you just implemented negative [07:24] reinforcement if you've taken your hands [07:26] and pushed down on your dog's shoulder [07:27] blades to give them a little bit of [07:28] guidance to go into the down and your [07:30] dog goes into a down and you remove your [07:32] hand you just use negative reinforcement [07:35] if you've done leash pressure training [07:37] negative reinforcement if you taught [07:38] your dog the healing stick negative [07:40] reinforcement again we turn on pressure [07:43] when they comply whatever that pressure [07:45] is is removed now we have positive [07:47] punishment another one that confuses [07:49] people because they think how can a [07:50] punishment be positive again adding to [07:52] the equation so anytime we add to the [07:54] equation to eliminate a behavior we're [07:56] implementing positive punishment if you [07:59] yell at your dog not recommended but [08:00] that's a version a leash pop on a [08:02] training collar a remote training collar [08:05] uh if you squirted your dog with a water [08:07] bottle and your dog doesn't like being [08:09] squirted with a water bottle anything we [08:10] add these are all examples of positive [08:13] punishment now if i'm going to use [08:15] positive punishment on my dogs while [08:17] training i use a leash and a training [08:19] collar i always use training collars and [08:21] never my hands the reason for this is [08:23] anytime our hands start to go towards [08:25] our dogs it should mean something good [08:28] we're adding some sort of value not [08:30] causing any sort of pain or discomfort [08:33] so hands as corrections not a good idea [08:36] no knife handing or heel kicking dogs we [08:38] use a leash and a training collar [08:40] because again anytime your hand goes [08:42] towards your dog your dog should be [08:43] happy because it means they're either [08:45] going to receive a treat they're going [08:46] to be pet or a toy something of value so [08:50] positive punishment adding something to [08:52] eliminate a behavior negative punishment [08:54] all you probably use this on your dogs [08:56] this is when we take something of value [08:58] away if you're petting your dog and your [09:00] dog jumps up and you stop petting you [09:02] just implemented negative punishment if [09:04] you ask your dog to sit and your dog [09:05] downs instead and you don't give your [09:07] dog the treat you just [09:08] implemented negative punishment so now [09:11] with all that being said i like to have [09:13] a word or sound that predicts each one [09:15] of those so then we can use those to [09:17] clearly and effectively communicate with [09:18] our dogs now we have two that predict [09:20] positive reinforcement and this often [09:22] confuses people as well [09:24] so we have one it's known as a [09:26] continuation marker and one that's known [09:27] as a terminal marker now the [09:29] continuation marker easiest way to [09:31] remember this is our words or our sounds [09:34] mean to our dogs what they predict [09:36] so a continuation marker i use the word [09:38] yes if you've watched my videos when i [09:40] tell a dog yes that just means they're [09:42] going to get a reward it just means here [09:44] comes the reward you did the behavior [09:46] correctly but it doesn't change the [09:48] dog's circumstances so if i have a dog [09:50] in a stay they must maintain the stay if [09:53] i have a dog free from a stay they [09:55] remain free from the stay my [09:56] continuation marker or my word yes just [09:59] means a reward then we have the terminal [10:02] marker the terminal marker guarantees [10:04] release and reward so if i'm working [10:06] with my dog and i have my dog in a state [10:08] position and i use the terminal marker [10:10] my dog is released from that stay and [10:12] they can come and get access to the [10:14] reward so the only time it really [10:16] matters which marker we're using if we [10:17] want to reinforce a behavior by giving [10:19] the dog a reward for something they did [10:21] it doesn't matter unless we are working [10:23] a stay so if you're not working any sort [10:25] of stay you can use either marker and [10:28] it's completely fine it only matters [10:29] when we start to work to stay and we [10:31] want either the dog to maintain the [10:32] position so we can give them a reward or [10:34] we would like to release them and give [10:36] them a reward now we also have a marker [10:39] that predicts negative reinforcement [10:41] this is going to be our leash pressure i [10:43] use the word wrong [10:45] i do this because it gives me an [10:46] opportunity to show my dog what i want [10:49] them to do in any given situation [10:50] without having to implement any sort of [10:52] positive punishment i use this when i'm [10:54] teaching the state i use it to reinforce [10:56] behaviors i use this when i'm teaching [10:58] boundaries or certain things i don't [11:00] want the dog to do for example the dog [11:02] breaks the stay i say one wrong that [11:04] pinpoints the moment in time the dog [11:06] made the mistake i go back i use the [11:08] leash and i place the dog back into the [11:09] stay position and i do that with all my [11:11] stays [11:12] or if i have a dog that's entering maybe [11:14] the room that we don't want them to be [11:15] in if you have a new infant or your [11:17] office or the kitchen the dog walks into [11:19] the kitchen we say wrong pinpointing the [11:21] moment in time the dog was incorrect and [11:23] we guide the dog out of the kitchen [11:25] using leash pressure negative [11:26] reinforcement not a punishment this [11:28] shows our dog if you hear us say the [11:31] word wrong or whatever word we choose [11:33] then you need to stop what you're doing [11:34] or go back into the previous position [11:36] and then we continue to do this up until [11:38] our dog knows what's expected of them [11:40] and they know how to turn off pressure [11:42] by complying and we become the pressure [11:44] when we're reinforcing specific [11:45] behaviors once we get to that point then [11:48] we can use positive punishment the word [11:50] that i like to use for that is the word [11:52] no so i say no before i give my dog a [11:55] correction so if i'm using a leash on a [11:57] martingale and i'm doing a leash pop my [11:59] dog does something i don't like let's [12:02] say my dog is chewing on the furniture [12:04] no correction my dog stops chewing on [12:06] the furniture good boy or good girl [12:09] whatever the case is [12:10] so no means you're going to receive a [12:12] correction so we can pinpoint a moment [12:13] in time if our dog's doing something [12:15] that is not allowed and we can follow it [12:17] up with the correction and then we have [12:19] a marker that predicts negative [12:21] punishment this is known as a [12:22] non-reinforcement marker this just means [12:25] our dog made a mistake they're not going [12:27] to receive the reward but they could try [12:28] again for example you tell your dog to [12:30] sit your dog lays down instead you go [12:32] uh-uh pinpointing the moment in time [12:34] your dog made the mistake you repeat the [12:36] command sit your dog sits yes reward and [12:39] your dog goes that's what gets me to the [12:40] reward and we do this when our dogs are [12:43] making mistakes now when we're [12:45] conditioning our dog to the markers it's [12:47] very important that the marker precedes [12:50] whatever the quadrant that we're using [12:53] it's supposed to predict so if i say yes [12:56] then that's supposed to predict a treat [12:57] if i say free that predicts a treat and [12:59] release that's my terminal marker if i [13:01] say wrong that predicts leash pressure [13:03] no that predicts a correction when we [13:05] are first getting our dog's condition to [13:06] the sounds and this comes from the [13:08] studies conducted by ivan pavlov he had [13:10] a tone that would go off prior to the [13:11] food being delivered to the dogs after a [13:13] certain amount of repetitions when the [13:14] dogs heard the tone they would begin to [13:16] salivate before the food is present [13:18] that's what he called classical [13:19] conditioning but if you think about it [13:21] he just renamed a word and that word is [13:23] predictability because if the sound went [13:25] up while the food was being delivered or [13:27] if the sound went off while the dogs [13:28] were eating they never became [13:30] classically conditioned to the sound the [13:31] sound has to precede the delivery of the [13:34] reward or whatever one we're using out [13:36] of those four quadrants by about a half [13:38] second or so now this is another thing [13:40] that gets people [13:41] uh struggling with teaching their dog [13:43] the markers and the reason why is they [13:45] say the marker and they want to get the [13:46] reward to the dog within a second [13:48] when we are conditioning our dogs to the [13:50] markers all we have to do is start to [13:52] move as long as the dog's watching us [13:54] start to move within a second of saying [13:56] the marker so let's say you're the dog [13:58] and i'm trying to get you conditioned to [13:59] the word yes i say yes once i finish [14:02] saying yes on the timeline that's when [14:04] the second starts and i have that entire [14:07] second before i have to start moving not [14:09] before i have to get you the reward so i [14:11] can go yes [14:13] and then start to move i like to give [14:15] myself a pause about a half second pause [14:17] now remember a second is way longer than [14:20] what most of us think one mississippi [14:22] two mississippi three mississippi four [14:24] mississippi one second is a good amount [14:26] of time so we say the marker and then we [14:28] have to start moving within a second we [14:30] don't have to get the reward to the dog [14:32] within a second we just have to start [14:33] moving so if i say yes [14:35] boom i made it i made it within the one [14:38] second the dog knows the treats coming [14:39] boom we made the connection same thing [14:41] with the terminal marker we save free or [14:43] whatever word you're choosing half [14:45] second pause then we move back [14:47] encouraging the dog to come get the [14:48] reward same thing with our wrong wrong [14:51] then leash pressure no [14:52] then the correction and we continue to [14:54] do this up until our dog's conditioned [14:56] once they're conditioned now we can use [14:59] it at any point in time and the most [15:01] effective way to use it is to say the [15:03] marker whether it's one that predicts [15:05] something that we would like the dog to [15:06] repeat a behavior such as yes or free or [15:09] if we're using a marker such as no to [15:11] stop a behavior we don't want all we [15:13] have to be able to do is say the marker [15:16] within a second of the dog doing the [15:18] behavior we're trying to capture so your [15:21] dog let's say [15:22] bites the carpet decides that it's a [15:24] good idea to bite the carpet you look [15:26] over you see your dog bite the carpet if [15:28] your dog stops biting the carpet and [15:30] more than a second goes by you've missed [15:32] your opportunity because now your dog's [15:34] on to something new but you do have a [15:36] whole second so you see your dog bite [15:38] the carpet you go no the dog goes oops i [15:40] messed up i'm not supposed to do that [15:42] and then we walk over and we can follow [15:44] up with the correction same thing with [15:46] our rewards if i have a dog 30 feet away [15:48] from me and i tell that dog to sit and [15:50] the moment that dog's butt hits the [15:51] ground i say yes pinpointing the moment [15:53] in time when the dog was correct now i [15:56] start to walk to the dog and the dog's [15:57] going oh i did it right here comes that [15:59] treat oh i'm getting paid and we give [16:02] him the reward we made the connection so [16:04] keep this in mind once your dog is [16:06] conditioned to the markers you have as [16:08] long as your dog is paying attention in [16:11] order to get them the primary reinforcer [16:14] so this is a good amount of time when we [16:16] get our dog's condition to the marker [16:18] doesn't mean it just gives us one extra [16:20] second that wouldn't be very valuable it [16:22] gives us as long as a dog is paying [16:24] attention so it could be 30 seconds it [16:26] could be two minutes three minutes as [16:28] long as the dog is maintaining focus and [16:30] they know the reward is coming to the [16:31] corrections coming you're going to be [16:33] able to make the connection and this is [16:34] going to make your training [16:36] significantly easier and there's all [16:38] kinds of different scenarios where [16:39] markers are so valuable if you're [16:41] teaching your dog a new behavior if [16:43] you're trying to teach your dog [16:44] boundaries if you're trying to show your [16:46] dog how to behave properly out in public [16:48] these are going to be the tools the [16:50] foundation that's going to help you [16:52] achieve your dog training goals and give [16:55] your dog a new level of freedom because [16:57] your dog is so obedient and does what [16:59] you need them to do and you're able to [17:01] communicate very clearly with them [17:10] now when we're conditioning our dog to [17:12] the marker we're going to be focusing on [17:13] a couple things number one you want to [17:15] do your best to try to make sure that [17:17] your marker sound whatever word you [17:18] decide to use always sounds the same [17:21] it's easy to think about how clickers [17:23] were so successful number one the click [17:25] always sounds the same so with your [17:27] voice try to make sure your yes or your [17:29] good or whatever sound you're using [17:31] sounds the same so yes yes yes not [17:35] yes [17:36] yes [17:38] yes you don't want to change it you want [17:40] to make sure it always sounds the same i [17:43] like to use two words for my markers [17:45] that predict rewards i have my yes and i [17:47] have my free my yes is my continuation [17:50] marker my free is my terminal marker [17:52] well what does that mean because this [17:53] often confuses people as well easiest [17:55] way to think about what a word means to [17:57] a dog is what it predicts the [17:59] continuation marker equals reward that's [18:02] it primary reward food toy affection so [18:04] if i say yes my dog is going to get [18:06] either food a toy or affection i like to [18:09] reserve my markers though for food and [18:11] toys that tends to be more valuable to [18:13] most dogs because we pet them all the [18:14] time so really food or toys and most of [18:17] time in the beginning i'm using food so [18:20] yes means food or reward free on the [18:23] other hand the terminal marker and again [18:24] you can use whatever word whatever sound [18:26] you want to use for these markers [18:29] that means release and reward so if i [18:32] say free to a dog i'm telling the dog [18:34] that's the correct behavior you are [18:35] released from that behavior and you can [18:37] receive a reward there's going to be [18:39] times when you want to use both markers [18:41] now we also have a release word a [18:43] release word is a sound that releases [18:46] the dog from the position but it doesn't [18:47] predict a reward and because of this [18:49] it's just a release sound it's not a [18:52] release marker so keep that in mind a [18:55] marker is only a marker when it predicts [18:57] a reward or predicts a correction so [18:59] marker could predict [19:01] you did a great job here's your reward [19:03] or don't do that again no you're going [19:04] to receive a correction so it can go for [19:06] good or bad the release word on the [19:08] other hand just means your release so [19:10] again it's not a marker i use all done [19:13] and i use break for my release words now [19:15] when i'm working with the puppy i want [19:17] the puppy to look up at my face in order [19:19] to get the rewards this is why it's [19:20] called engagement training the more [19:22] engagement the more focus you can get [19:24] from your dog while training the faster [19:25] they're going to learn so the puppy is [19:27] going to look up at me i'm going to say [19:29] yes and then i'm going to reward the [19:30] puppy once the puppy eats the food he [19:33] looks at me again i'm going to save free [19:35] then i'm going to move back encouraging [19:36] the puppy to jump up and get the reward [19:38] during the training process when i say [19:40] yes i bring the reward to the dog and [19:42] when i say free i move back encouraging [19:44] the dog to come and get the reward that [19:46] teaches them that free is release and [19:48] reward now once they're conditioned to [19:50] these sounds we no longer have to move [19:52] back this is another common question [19:53] that i've had in some of my videos if [19:55] your dog is conditioned to the word free [19:56] and let's say you tell your dog to down [19:58] once you lure your dog into the down [20:00] position you say free you can hand the [20:03] food directly to your dog while they're [20:04] still in the down you don't have to make [20:06] them jump up to get the reward as long [20:07] as they're conditioned at that point and [20:09] they understand that it means releasing [20:11] rewards so you can hand them the food [20:12] and they can jump up [20:13] so now what applications or what value [20:16] is there to having these two markers [20:18] well the continuation marker is often [20:20] called the continuation marker because [20:21] if you're working on a stay sit stay [20:23] down stay climb stay whatever it is you [20:26] use the continuation marker because [20:27] you're telling your dog that's correct [20:29] i'm going to give you a reward but i'm [20:31] not releasing you it just means you're [20:32] getting a reward so you're able to [20:34] reward the dog multiple times for doing [20:36] a long stay when you're first teaching [20:38] them that stay command the terminal [20:40] marker is very valuable for a few [20:42] reasons as well number one if you're not [20:44] ready to reinforce the stay then you use [20:47] the terminal marker so if i'm starting [20:48] to teach a dog the verbal command and i [20:51] say down and that dog lays down and i [20:52] don't want to reinforce a down stay then [20:54] i'm going to use my terminal marker free [20:56] i'm letting the dog know that's correct [20:58] you don't have to stay there you can [20:59] jump up and get the reward so it helps [21:01] when we're not wanting or not ready to [21:03] reinforce the stay another reason that [21:05] makes the terminal marker so valuable [21:07] and why i use it so much in the [21:09] beginning is because it also teaches the [21:11] dog the faster they get into the [21:12] position that i'm asking them to perform [21:14] the faster they get to jump up and get [21:16] the reward and they tend to do it more [21:18] quickly speed for our dogs is based on [21:21] motivation and this really helps [21:23] increase our dog's speed [21:25] now when teaching these markers we have [21:27] to make sure that there is a pause in [21:28] between the sound and the delivery of [21:30] the reward so the very first thing i'm [21:32] going to do is i'm going to take the [21:33] food i'm going to show the puppy that i [21:35] have the food and i'm going to hold it [21:36] by my face once the puppy looks up in my [21:38] face i'm going to say yes [21:41] then i'm going to deliver a reward in [21:43] the beginning we hold our hands by our [21:45] face we know that the dog is looking at [21:47] our hands because the dog knows that the [21:49] food comes from our hands so we get them [21:52] used to looking up at our face by [21:53] holding our hands by our face after we [21:56] say the sound you have one second before [21:59] you have to start moving to deliver the [22:01] reward meaning i say yes once i'm done [22:04] saying yes i have one second before i [22:06] have to start to move to deliver the [22:08] reward to the dog or the puppy so i go [22:10] yes [22:11] and then i can start moving as long as [22:13] that movement starts before the one [22:15] second this is only during the process [22:17] when we're conditioning them to the [22:19] markers same with the three i say three [22:21] and then i have to start moving back [22:23] within a second after i say free to get [22:26] the dog conditioned if you wait too long [22:28] then the dog's not going to become [22:30] conditioned or if you say it and you [22:32] move at the exact same time they're not [22:34] going to become conditioned so if you go [22:35] yes they won't become conditioned or if [22:37] you go yes [22:39] and you wait too long [22:41] and you reward they're not going to [22:42] become conditioned so it's that window [22:44] yes and then reward what helps a lot of [22:47] people is to actually say the marker [22:49] twice and then deliver the reward but [22:50] say it in your head so go yes yes reward [22:53] but don't say it out loud go yes [22:56] reward so in my head i'm going yes yes [22:58] reward that's usually the perfect amount [23:01] of timing in order to get the dog [23:03] conditioned to the reward or the marker [23:05] once they're conditioned to the marker [23:07] this is another question that i ask a [23:08] lot of people how long do you have to [23:10] deliver the primary reinforcement to [23:12] your dog after you said the marker so [23:14] when you say yes how long do you have to [23:16] get that reward to your dog before you [23:18] lose the connection most people say one [23:20] second that's not the case if the dog is [23:22] conditioned to the marker you have as [23:24] long as they are paying attention so if [23:26] you have your dog 30 feet away from you [23:28] and you tell your dog sit and your dog [23:29] sits and you say yes and your dog's [23:31] conditioned to yes and he knows he's [23:32] going to receive a reward once you say [23:34] yes your dog goes i did it correctly you [23:36] start walking towards your dog the dog's [23:38] going oh here comes the treat here comes [23:40] the reward he sees you reach your hand [23:42] into the treat bag or whatever it is [23:44] that you have he sees you pull out the [23:46] treat he goes there's my treat i'm [23:47] getting paid and you hand him the reward [23:49] you made the connection even though that [23:51] reward came way after the behavior you [23:53] were capturing your dog knows whatever [23:56] he or she was doing when they heard that [23:58] sound is what they're being rewarded for [24:00] you're gonna see how these markers are [24:01] gonna come into play throughout the [24:02] entire training process another common [24:05] question that's often asked is do i [24:07] always have to give my dog a ton of [24:09] rewards when training do i always need [24:12] treats is this something if i start [24:13] training my dog with treats am i always [24:15] going to have to need treats when [24:16] training no we start with treats in the [24:18] beginning we start with continual [24:20] reinforcement meaning we reward every [24:22] single behavior but once the dog starts [24:24] to do the command on the verbal alone so [24:26] i say down the dog lays down without [24:28] that help of the physical cue then i [24:30] start to space out the rewards i have a [24:32] video explaining exactly how to do that [24:34] but remember dogs always need to know [24:37] the with them what's in it for me [24:39] contrary to popular belief dogs don't do [24:41] things just to make us happy they do [24:43] things either to access something [24:45] pleasant prevent something unpleasant or [24:47] the behavior it's fun now if you teach [24:48] your dog that training with you is a lot [24:50] of fun and they love that then they will [24:52] start to train with you just because the [24:54] act of training with you is fun but in [24:56] the beginning most are going to need a [24:57] little bit of encouragement whether [24:58] that's with food or it's going to be [25:00] with toys i like to start with food [25:02] because we can use luring we can use [25:04] shaping in order to teach a bunch of [25:06] different behaviors to our dog so let's [25:08] not waste any more time let's jump right [25:09] into this training session i'm going to [25:11] show you exactly how you're going to get [25:12] your puppy or your dog conditioned to [25:14] these markers all right so we're going [25:16] to be doing engagement training with [25:17] spock here spock is a young collie puppy [25:20] now remember what i talked about the [25:22] sound has to come before the delivery of [25:24] the reward so i get his attention i [25:26] bring my hands to my face yes [25:29] then i reward notice there was a slight [25:31] pause [25:33] between [25:34] saying the marker yes and delivering the [25:36] reward it has to be yes [25:38] reward [25:40] not the common mistake that most people [25:42] do [25:43] yes you see how i moved at the exact [25:45] same time as i deliver the reward if [25:48] he's gonna take it it seems like he's [25:49] chewing the other piece still [25:52] so again we have to make sure that we [25:53] say the sound before we deliver the [25:55] reward that's the only way the dog is [25:56] going to become conditioned so now i'm [25:58] going to show you a quick engagement [26:00] training session that i like to do with [26:01] the dog so you can see what it looks [26:03] like without me constantly having to [26:04] communicate back to the camera alright [26:06] so here we go [26:08] yes good job buddy very nice [26:13] free [26:14] come on good boy very good oops we [26:17] dropped a piece that's okay he doesn't [26:19] know [26:22] yes [26:23] reward good boy very nice [26:26] free [26:27] movement [26:29] pay attention to the pause pay attention [26:31] to how i'm saying the marker it always [26:33] sounds the same [26:35] yes [26:36] and i'm not worried about him doing any [26:38] sort of commanded behavior i just want [26:40] him looking up at me [26:41] free [26:42] and then we move back [26:44] this is the first step now most dogs [26:46] don't need much beyond this when it [26:47] comes to engagement training yes [26:50] but if you want to go above and beyond [26:52] or if you plan on doing a focus heel or [26:54] competition style obedience then you [26:56] want to get the dog or the puppy to [26:58] understand it's looking at your face [27:00] yes [27:01] and not just looking at your hands [27:03] that's getting the reward so the way [27:04] that i do that is i start exact same way [27:07] i would i bring the food up by my face [27:09] and then i move one hand out he follows [27:11] the hand when he looks back at me [27:14] yes [27:15] then i mark and reward and then i do the [27:17] same thing with the other hand i bring [27:19] that hand out i wait till he looks at me [27:21] yes when he looks at me i mark and [27:23] reward then i do both hands [27:25] [Music] [27:27] yes and then reward so that's showing [27:30] him it's looking at my face that's [27:32] getting the reward and not just my hand [27:34] all right so we're gonna do a couple [27:36] more [27:37] free [27:38] and then we move also notice how i [27:40] change hands [27:43] yes [27:44] reward good very nice buddy [27:47] free [27:48] reward [27:50] excellent [27:52] good [27:55] yes [27:57] notice the pause again [27:59] free [28:00] very good now i like to continue this [28:03] until the dog becomes conditioned to the [28:04] marker how do we know in a dog's [28:06] condition to the marker well the same [28:08] way ivan pavlov knew his dogs were [28:10] conditioned to the markers that whole [28:12] classical conditioning [28:14] when the sound went off before the food [28:15] was delivered to the dogs they would [28:17] begin to salivate [28:18] before the food was present and again [28:20] that's what he called classical [28:21] conditioning the four most common change [28:23] of behaviors i see in a dog that's [28:24] conditioned to the marker is opening [28:26] their mouth salivating licking their [28:29] lips or moving their paws so if i think [28:31] a dog is conditioned i'll get them in [28:33] front of me [28:34] let them scratch do what they got to do [28:36] and then once they look at me i say the [28:38] marker yes [28:40] but i wouldn't deliver the reward right [28:42] away i would watch to see if there's a [28:44] change of behavior yes [28:46] if i see a change of behavior i know the [28:48] dog's condition to the markers now [28:50] usually i'll do this for a day maybe two [28:53] most dogs will become conditioned pretty [28:55] fast to these sounds [28:56] but before every training session i like [28:59] to spend 15 to 30 seconds on engagement [29:01] training because it gets our dogs [29:03] engaged and the more engaged your dog is [29:06] the faster your dog is going to learn [29:07] what's expected of them [29:12] good girl yes [29:14] very nice [29:16] free [29:17] good girl that's very good [29:21] this way [29:23] that's a 20."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 329/841,[29:25] yes [29:26] good girl [29:30] free [29:31] very nice so right there she wasn't [29:33] looking i messed up but it's okay she [29:35] didn't mess up i did [29:36] yes [29:37] good [29:38] girl [29:40] free [29:41] very nice good job [29:45] yes [29:46] excellent [29:49] free also notice i'm switching hands [29:51] good girl [29:53] yes [29:56] free [29:58] very nice [30:00] good girl [30:01] free [30:03] good come on baby [30:04] very nice [30:06] excellent come on sweetie [30:09] drop the piece [30:12] yes [30:13] reward [30:14] make sure you're switching hands [30:16] free [30:17] movement [30:18] so i'm going to use the right hand come [30:19] on baby [30:21] and then go back to left yes [30:23] reward remember to make sure there's [30:25] always that pause don't pair your [30:26] physical with your verbal so don't do [30:28] this [30:29] yes [30:30] even though it looks very similar [30:36] free [30:37] right there i paired it so that's the [30:38] incorrect way you want to make sure the [30:40] word completely leaves your mouth yes [30:43] before you deliver the reward and before [30:45] you move [30:46] free [30:47] and then movement good girl excellent [30:52] yes [30:53] reward [30:55] good girl [30:57] free [30:58] moving yay very nice [31:01] good come on sweet [31:04] yes [31:05] reward [31:07] good girl [31:08] free [31:09] movement [31:11] yes good boy [31:13] free [31:15] very nice [31:17] yes [31:19] i'll get it buddy [31:22] free [31:23] good [31:26] yes [31:29] free [31:34] yes [31:37] free [31:41] yes [31:43] so he does the pause he moves the pause [31:45] and that shows me that he understands [31:47] that yes means he's going to get a [31:48] reward and he's getting excited because [31:50] he's anticipating the tree same thing [31:53] with his terminal marker free [31:56] so you can see a change of behavior when [31:58] i give him that marker sound and that [32:00] shows me that he's conditioned yes good [32:03] boy excellent oops dropped it [32:07] everybody [32:08] free [32:09] good [32:10] very nice [32:12] so he's conditioned to it and i'm going [32:13] to bring out ari next [32:15] again yes reward [32:18] free movement good [32:22] yes reward [32:24] free [32:27] good girl come on [32:30] yes reward [32:33] free movement [32:35] so now [32:36] i want you to get a close-up of charlie [32:37] or not charlie arie rather and you can [32:40] see her change of behavior she's also [32:42] conditioned to the markers but hers is a [32:44] little bit more subtle than charlie's [32:46] yes [32:48] so you see she does a little bit of a [32:49] movement [32:52] free [32:53] and with free she jumps up because she's [32:55] ready to get the reward and i often [32:56] reward her free where i'll have her jump [32:59] up [33:00] so it's however you condition your dog [33:02] but we want to make sure before we move [33:04] on to the next step yes [33:06] that our dog is conditioned to the sound [33:07] you can see on that one she kind of [33:09] closed her mouth a little bit [33:11] yes [33:12] she's so cute [33:14] free and then movement [33:16] excellent [33:20] yes reward good [33:22] boy free [33:25] come on good and i messed up there [33:27] because he wasn't looking at me when i [33:28] said it yes [33:30] good [33:31] free movement [33:36] yes free [33:40] excellent job buddy [33:42] gotta be guy hero [33:46] yes [33:49] free [33:51] and that's him offering up behaviors [33:53] yes [33:55] free [33:58] very good buddy [34:02] yes [34:05] free [34:07] good [34:09] yes [34:12] free [34:16] fix shaping and free shaping [34:19] this is where we're going to get dogs to [34:21] do behaviors without having to lure them [34:23] or guide them into the position we want [34:25] them to perform [34:26] the difference is fix shaping is you [34:28] have something in mind you want your dog [34:30] to perform and free shaping is you don't [34:33] necessarily have something you want your [34:35] dog to perform but you're going to [34:36] reward them when they do behaviors that [34:38] you like [34:39] you have to make sure before you do [34:40] either one of these that your dog is [34:42] conditioned to your markers [34:44] so at fix shaping this is how a lot of [34:46] trainers will get a dog to ride a [34:48] skateboard they don't have to make the [34:50] dog do the skateboard they can have [34:51] their training room where they work with [34:53] their dog every single day one day the [34:55] dog goes into the training room and [34:56] there's a skateboard in the center of [34:57] the floor the dog walks over to [35:00] naturally investigate the skateboard and [35:02] once they touch it the trainer uses a [35:04] terminal marker and the dog runs over [35:05] and gets a reward [35:06] and then the dog goes back to the [35:08] skateboard and says what did i do [35:11] that made you reward me like that and [35:13] they touch the skateboard again and the [35:14] trainer uses the terminal marker again [35:15] the dog comes back they get another [35:17] reward [35:18] and then the dog goes back to the [35:20] skateboard now they have both paws on [35:21] the skateboard the trainer marks they [35:23] come get the reward they go back they [35:25] have both paws and they slide the [35:27] skateboard a little bit the trainer [35:29] marks the behavior the dog comes back [35:30] and gets the reward and before you know [35:32] it now you have a dog riding a [35:34] skateboard this is the technique that i [35:36] use when i'm teaching a dog scent [35:38] detection i'll have a climb command or a [35:40] climb rather that i'll reward the dog [35:42] for jumping up on that climb and they'll [35:44] do that every single day and then one [35:46] day they'll jump up on there and i'll [35:47] have an empty paint bucket or maybe an [35:50] empty cinder block or something that i'm [35:52] using for scent detection [35:53] the dog goes over and they naturally [35:55] investigate the bucket by placing their [35:57] nose into it once they do that i use the [35:59] terminal marker they come back and get [36:00] the reward then they go back and they [36:02] put their nose in it again and they get [36:03] the reward now they know that sticking [36:05] their nose into the can is something i [36:07] want them to do without actually having [36:09] to force them into the can i just used [36:11] something that they were naturally going [36:13] to investigate as a way to teach a [36:15] behavior and then that would continue on [36:17] to more advanced scent detection work [36:19] that's using fixed shaping to get my dog [36:21] to do certain behaviors now free shaping [36:23] you don't have anything in mind you want [36:25] your dog to perform but you're going to [36:27] reward them for behaviors that you like [36:28] and this is something i highly recommend [36:30] to every single pet person out there [36:32] this will pay dividends later on [36:35] what you're going to do is you're going [36:36] to have food in your pocket [36:38] you're not going to let your dog know [36:39] that you have rewards on you and when [36:41] your dog does a behavior that you like [36:42] you're going to reward them so in the [36:44] morning you have your dog your dog looks [36:46] up at you [36:48] yes you give them a piece of food your [36:50] dog sits yes you give them a piece of [36:52] food your dog goes over to their bed yes [36:55] you give them a piece of food you're [36:57] being very clear what you like that your [36:59] dog does what behaviors does your dog [37:02] perform that you like and they're going [37:03] to start to learn this and they're going [37:05] to start to actively seek out these [37:06] behaviors in order to get a reward and [37:09] this is really what separates the [37:11] proactive dog from a reactive dog but we [37:14] want our dog to understand that their [37:15] behavior can drive the production of the [37:17] reward and by doing free shaping you're [37:20] really going to place your dog in a [37:21] position to understand this and this is [37:23] going to be one of those ways in order [37:25] to get your dog to do a behavior when [37:26] you don't have food on you so you tell [37:28] you tell your dog to sit your dog goes [37:30] you might have a reward and they sit and [37:32] boom out pops a treat [37:34] so i recommend doing free shaping fix [37:37] shaping is something you can do if you [37:38] like [37:39] but free shaping is something you [37:41] definitely should do to help create that [37:44] proactive dog [37:48] there's different skills that you want [37:50] to develop before getting into the real [37:52] training with your dog what i mean is [37:54] really teaching them their sit their [37:56] down they're coming a lot of those basic [37:57] obedience commands that you want your [37:59] dog to know there's certain skill sets [38:01] we want to develop one is going to be [38:03] luring luring is where the dog will [38:06] follow food that you have in your hand [38:08] and you can use that to guide them into [38:11] different positions [38:12] wherever the nose goes the butt does the [38:14] opposite so if you lift up and the dog's [38:16] nose goes up butt goes down [38:19] you got the dog to do a sit you bring [38:21] your food to the ground the dog lays [38:23] down you bring the food to the dog's [38:25] chest the nose goes to the chest the [38:26] butt pops up you guide the dog in a [38:29] circle you can manipulate the dog into [38:31] almost any position using this technique [38:34] using luring and when we first start off [38:37] doing this all i want the dog to do is [38:39] to push into my hand so if i'm holding [38:41] food the dog is pushing into my hand in [38:43] order to get the reward once i feel them [38:45] push [38:46] i say yes and i release the food they [38:48] push into my hand yes release making [38:51] sure that the food or my hand doesn't [38:53] release the food or the food isn't [38:54] rewarded to the dog until after i say [38:56] yes so it's yes [38:57] then i release yes then i release so dog [39:00] is pushing into my hand yes release dog [39:02] is pushing into my hand yes release okay [39:05] that's going to be the first step and [39:06] then i can use luring again to teach [39:08] behaviors i want them to perform and [39:10] chasing chasing is using food so we're [39:13] going to use our food drive and we're [39:16] going to use our prey drive to make the [39:18] training more fun and more engaging [39:21] if my dog does a behavior that i like [39:23] and they're coming for the food if i cut [39:24] back very quickly a lot of praise and [39:27] encouragement the dog runs back to get [39:28] the food it's going to make it more fun [39:30] more entertaining so i really make them [39:32] chase that food and i'll throw that in [39:34] there to kind of get them more amped up [39:36] and more excited about the training and [39:38] i'm going to show you exactly how to [39:39] teach both of these laureen all we're [39:41] going to do for that [39:43] is we're going to take the food we're [39:44] going to place it in our hand and when i [39:46] place food in my hand [39:48] i like to use my thumb to hold it in [39:50] position instead of holding it at my [39:52] fingertips and the reason for this is it [39:55] creates a little valley [39:57] for my puppy if he's interested in my [39:59] food instead of [40:02] the sticks on the ground [40:04] so it creates a little valley for him to [40:06] stick his muzzle in [40:07] to grab the food without biting my hands [40:10] good boy [40:12] okay so that's how we're going to want [40:13] to hold the food and all luring is when [40:15] we're teaching our dog how to lure we [40:17] let him push into our hand yes [40:19] and when he pushes into our hand nicely [40:23] yes [40:24] good [40:27] yes i'm gonna mark the behavior and i'm [40:29] gonna reward [40:30] yes good job buddy [40:33] all i want him to do during the step [40:36] yes is push into my hand [40:39] yes good [40:40] now he's actually it's hard to tell on [40:42] the video but he's actually pushing my [40:45] hand and when my hand moves [40:48] i'm marking and rewarding [40:50] yes good boy [40:52] nice job my little man nice job buddy [40:55] all right we'll do a couple more yes [40:58] very good [41:00] yes excellent [41:03] yes [41:04] very nice okay so that's going to be [41:06] luring and this is going to be a tool [41:08] that we're going to use [41:09] to help us teach many of the other [41:11] behaviors we're going to be showing our [41:12] dog [41:13] the next thing i like to do is teach the [41:15] dog the concept of chasing all we're [41:17] doing is we're getting our dog our puppy [41:20] to chase the toy so we're going to be [41:21] using a couple different drives we're [41:23] going to be using prey drive by creating [41:25] that movement and we're also going to be [41:28] using food drive since the dog is going [41:30] for food [41:31] derby come here buddy [41:33] come on buddy buddy buddy good boy so [41:36] for this i'm going to use my terminal [41:37] marker and i'm going to play a little [41:39] chasing game free [41:42] whoa [41:43] nice job you see how he picks up a [41:44] little bit of the energy good [41:46] boy and then again if he comes for it i [41:50] cut back really quick good boy [41:52] nice job [41:54] any way that i can [41:57] move it away very quick [41:59] to get him bouncy get him a little bit [42:00] more playful and get him more engaged so [42:03] he's not as focused on all these sticks [42:04] on the ground good boy come on [42:07] nicely done [42:09] so chasing again i'm just cutting it [42:11] boom really quick [42:13] getting the dog to run towards me in [42:16] order to get that toy and this is what [42:18] we're going to use to make the training [42:20] more fun to make it more playful the [42:22] more your dog enjoys training the faster [42:24] they're going to learn so we want to [42:26] make it as fun as possible especially [42:28] when you're working with a young puppy [42:29] like derby here i want to start [42:31] developing our power steering so what [42:34] i'm going to do and my puppy's starting [42:36] to get a little tired but that's okay we [42:37] can still work with it first go back [42:39] into just the luring get him to follow [42:41] the food and getting his head to turn [42:44] back and forth to his left side as well [42:47] as to his right side [42:49] all right once we have that what we're [42:51] going to do is we're going to grab the [42:52] food and we're going to cup it in both [42:54] our hands and all i'm going to do is [42:56] place it up against my leg and i'm gonna [42:58] pivot around yes and when he steps in [43:00] the direction that i want him to go [43:03] yes i'm gonna mark and reward and i'm [43:05] gonna go back the other way [43:10] yes [43:11] good so you see by turning [43:14] it makes it easier for him to pivot [43:16] around his back end in order to get [43:19] access to the food and this is all i'm [43:21] really doing i'm just holding the food [43:23] and i'm spinning [43:25] yes [43:26] in a circle to get him to follow the [43:28] food and this is going to help [43:31] when i start using this to go around the [43:33] cones to guide them into different [43:35] positions it's just that power steering [43:38] same thing if i have him over in the [43:40] heel position i'm going to cut my hand [43:43] and then i'm going to pivot around with [43:45] him right there [43:47] and this is going to help yes [43:49] with our left about turns our right [43:52] about turns [43:53] and i'm giving him food pretty much the [43:55] whole time [43:57] but it's just getting him used to really [43:59] pushing into that hand [44:01] getting that luring technique down but [44:03] developing it so well that you can [44:06] literally guide your dog into any [44:08] position [44:09] using [44:14] that power steering technique [44:18] power steering a little charlie here [44:19] remember we want to guide first get [44:21] their head kind of moving back and forth [44:29] good [44:32] very nice [44:34] and when i say yes is when i'm giving [44:35] him the reward so you guys know when [44:40] yes [44:42] yes [44:43] good [44:45] and then we're gonna get him to pivot in [44:46] place [44:48] yes [44:51] yes good [44:53] yes very nice [45:00] yes [45:01] excellent [45:04] yes good [45:05] now that he's doing that nicely i want [45:07] to start getting him to pivot in [45:09] position just using the one hand [45:11] yes [45:12] good boy [45:13] and i can also use that pivoting in [45:15] place come on buddy [45:20] very nice good boy [45:23] pivoting to the right as well [45:29] remember doing this power steering is [45:31] going to help us later with our right [45:34] about turn our left about turns [45:38] and our flip finish and buy finish okay [45:40] so he did great that was a nice nice [45:42] little session [45:46] so we're going to do the sit first [45:47] wherever nose goes butt does the [45:49] opposite so we take our hand we lift up [45:51] yes [45:52] once our [45:53] pups rear end hits the ground that's [45:56] when we mark [45:57] so he's chewing his food come and be gay [46:00] lift [46:01] yes and reward [46:03] during this step since we're not saying [46:05] the command notice i'm not telling him [46:06] to sit we could also use our terminal [46:09] marker so we can lift free and reward [46:12] lift [46:13] free [46:15] and reward so again remember for him [46:18] free means he's going to get a reward [46:20] and he's released yes means he's going [46:22] to get a reward again during this step [46:24] we can use either marker it's completely [46:26] up to you [46:30] so i'm gonna take the food and i'm gonna [46:32] lift up [46:33] yes [46:34] the moment her butt hits the ground i'm [46:36] gonna give her the food [46:39] yes [46:40] good girl and i'm not worried about her [46:42] staying in the position yes [46:44] very nice so you see when i say yes [46:48] i bring it to her let's see how it looks [46:50] when i use the terminal marker [46:52] free [46:53] good girl very good [46:56] free [46:57] excellent very nice [47:02] free good girl so watch her butt when [47:05] her butt hits the ground that's when i'm [47:07] staying my [47:09] marker [47:10] free [47:11] excellent good girl [47:13] again making sure you switch hands you [47:15] don't always want to use three [47:17] the same hand because then your dog will [47:19] focus just on that one hand [47:22] hey here we go teaching the scent [47:23] command we take the food in our hand we [47:25] lift up [47:27] free butt hits the ground we use that [47:29] terminal marker and we reward the puppy [47:32] free [47:33] okay we can use the terminal marker if [47:35] we like and now remember during this [47:37] step when we're shaping the behavior we [47:39] don't have to [47:40] always use the terminal [47:42] free if we don't want to because we're [47:45] not giving the dog a verbal command [47:47] there's no verbal command so that means [47:48] we're not reinforcing the state so if i [47:51] want i can lift up [47:53] yes [47:54] and bring it to the puppy if i choose [47:57] rewarding him in position [48:01] yes and he's allowed to get up from that [48:03] position because i have not said sit [48:06] all right so remember what we want to do [48:08] is we lift up when the butt hits the [48:09] ground we're going to use our terminal [48:10] marker [48:11] free [48:14] free [48:17] free [48:20] free [48:22] free [48:26] free [48:30] free [48:33] free [48:34] very good my man [48:36] free [48:39] free [48:40] good [48:44] now for the down a common mistake people [48:46] make with the down is they'll bring [48:48] their hand down and as the dog tries to [48:50] go for it they'll move their hand away [48:53] what you want to do is you want to go [48:54] straight down and you also want to [48:56] create a cave with your hand what i mean [48:58] by that when i'm going down i'm doing [49:00] this you can kind of see it creates a [49:02] cave that our dog has to place their [49:04] muzzle into and when they go down and [49:07] they place their muzzle into that cave [49:08] it naturally brings the rear end down so [49:11] again we cup the food and we go straight [49:13] down yes [49:15] once the elbows hit the ground we mark [49:17] and reward we can use this as an [49:19] opportunity as well to bring him back up [49:21] into the sit so again we go down yes [49:24] then we reward we bring him back up [49:28] once he finishes chewing yes into the [49:30] sit so i can do some puppy push-ups [49:32] right here yes [49:34] make him do it down and then bring him [49:36] back up to the sit yes [49:38] very simple [49:42] so i bring it down you see how i'm [49:44] creating a cave [49:45] by turning my hand the dog's nose has to [49:48] go underneath the palm of my hand in [49:51] order to get to the food which makes him [49:54] lay down just like she's doing so again [49:56] we go straight down yes once she gets [49:58] into position we mark and we reward and [50:01] right now since she's coming back up [50:02] into the set i can reward that as well [50:04] yes good girl so let's see how it looks [50:06] when i get her moving around and i like [50:08] to to bring my hand straight down [50:11] yes good girl very nice [50:17] yes [50:18] excellent good [50:20] when i'm working with a puppy yes [50:22] i like to use meal time yes [50:25] as an opportunity to train [50:27] the key things you want to keep in mind [50:29] is once she gets into position yes [50:32] that's what we mark the behavior i'm [50:34] watching her elbows touch the ground if [50:36] for some reason the dog's back end goes [50:39] up i'm gonna wait that butt goes down [50:41] yes [50:42] mark and reward now as i was saying [50:44] before in the previous video some dogs [50:47] will go down like this [50:48] yes but their butt won't go down right [50:50] away so what i'll do is i will reward [50:53] them for attempting until that butt goes [50:55] down then i'll give them [50:57] whatever's left in my hand so i'm [50:59] showing them i'm gonna reward you you're [51:00] putting in the effort but what we really [51:02] want is we want you to lay all the way [51:04] down if you have a dog with a lower [51:06] level of perseverance you don't want [51:07] them to quit because they're not getting [51:09] access to that reward [51:13] yes and she's figuring this out very [51:15] very quickly she's a smart little dog [51:18] yes [51:19] you're gonna see though the way that you [51:20] handle the food is going to make a [51:22] really big difference [51:24] on how easy or how difficult it is for [51:27] your dog to figure out what it is you [51:29] want them to perform but this is going [51:31] to be [51:32] using our luring cube to get our dog to [51:35] go into the down command so we're taking [51:38] the food we're cuffing it some dogs are [51:40] gonna be more challenging than others [51:42] he's very easy but some dogs are gonna [51:44] have to free [51:46] hold it there a little bit longer and be [51:48] patient with it free [51:53] free good [51:56] free [51:58] free [52:02] free very nice [52:05] free good [52:10] free good boy [52:13] free [52:17] the next one's going to be the stand [52:19] with the stand i like to take my hand [52:21] and i like to turn the cup or the bowl [52:23] like if i create a bowl i turn the bowl [52:26] away so then the puppy or the dog has to [52:28] come around to get their muzzle inside [52:30] which will naturally bring their back [52:32] end up it doesn't always work right away [52:34] and he struggles a little bit with it so [52:36] i'm going to help him out just by taking [52:38] my hand underneath his belly scooping up [52:40] his back end so i take the food [52:42] bring it underneath and then i help him [52:44] out yes once he pops up that back end i [52:47] mark and reward so again we lift [52:50] yes [52:52] so i could do a sit there and then i [52:54] bring this to his chest then [52:56] i help yes [52:57] and reward again if you're gonna help [52:59] out like i am right here make sure [53:01] whatever you're using for the lure [53:04] comes first so if i have him in front of [53:06] me i'm doing the lure first [53:08] which he doesn't fully know yet then i'm [53:10] helping yes [53:11] so again it becomes a predictable [53:12] pattern he likes to pop his rear end up [53:14] and shift a little bit to the side if [53:16] that continues [53:18] then i could use something like a [53:20] shaping box or i could use a wall to [53:22] prevent him from practicing that but for [53:24] the demonstration purposes it's okay [53:27] again tuck to his chest help him out yes [53:30] reward so that's going to be the start [53:32] of our stand command [53:37] again tucking it towards her chest [53:39] hoping to get her back in the pop-up [53:42] yes [53:43] just like that very good [53:45] very good yes [53:47] and i'll reward her for the si as well [53:51] it's still early in her training yes so [53:53] i'm rewarding every single behavior [53:56] yeah oh [53:57] yes [53:59] we'll throw it down in there as well and [54:01] we'll see if we can get her to pop back [54:02] up using the food [54:04] the luring [54:06] oh there was a noise no big deal [54:09] yes good girl it's not going to be [54:12] perfect in the beginning but we're not [54:14] worried about perfection just yet [54:16] yes good girl [54:20] come on baby [54:22] you can do it yes [54:23] good very nice so i'm not having to help [54:25] her which is really good but if i was to [54:27] help her [54:28] if she was having a hard time and the [54:30] back end wasn't popping up i would just [54:32] use my hand and just provide that little [54:35] extra bit of assistance to give her more [54:37] of a clear path [54:39] of what i want her to do [54:41] and she's very food motivated which [54:43] helps a lot [54:46] yes [54:47] good girl [54:49] okay so he's flopping down what you're [54:51] going to see with some dogs we want to [54:52] bring them back up [54:55] and i could even help a little bit with [54:57] the leash come on buddy yes and then [54:59] reward [55:00] good [55:02] so we're going to bring them back up [55:04] into the sit good [55:07] rotate the hand towards the chest help [55:10] him out with the leash if i need to come [55:12] on buddy come on come on come on [55:14] get that back end up [55:18] yes then reward [55:21] good job buddy [55:27] yes reward [55:29] okay so [55:31] rotate the hand towards the chest i can [55:33] help by bringing my hand under there as [55:34] well [55:35] so i'm not using the leash pressure then [55:37] at that point bring him back up [55:40] help him with the leash he's trying to [55:42] find freebies [55:44] rotate the hand towards the chest help [55:46] out yes reward so you can see i'm [55:48] bringing my hand underneath [55:50] guiding pushing his legs back to get him [55:52] to stand up [55:54] yes reward so sometimes it'll even help [55:58] to place your dog sideways in front of [56:00] you so then you can do a sit [56:03] you can bring the dog back into it down [56:05] [Music] [56:06] and then you can guide them right back [56:08] up into the stand [56:10] and all i'm doing is teaching them what [56:12] each thing means and just giving them a [56:13] little extra help using my left hand [56:17] yes good job bring him back into the [56:19] down yes [56:21] and then back up into the stand and each [56:23] time i say yes he's getting a piece of [56:25] food because i had a handful of food [56:27] there [56:29] them back into the down and this one [56:30] takes a little bit of repetition [56:31] especially if you're working with a [56:33] young puppy a stand is a more difficult [56:35] behavior to teach so you see he did that [56:37] one [56:38] really nice and easily just after a [56:40] couple of them he's already starting to [56:41] get it but again he's a smart little guy [56:44] so we're gonna take another handful [56:45] guide it towards the chest help him out [56:47] a little bit see if he stands yes reward [56:49] good job buddy let's bring him into that [56:51] sit help him out [56:54] yes reward and guide him back into the [56:56] stand [56:57] yes reward beautiful and when i'm doing [57:00] the stand what i want to do is i want to [57:02] bring [57:04] the food i cup it again i rotate my hand [57:07] and i bring the food to the chest see [57:09] how his butt popped up [57:11] so cup [57:13] to the chest good [57:14] and once i get the dog to understand [57:17] each position this is why i do stand [57:19] last because i can go from a stand or i [57:21] can go from a sit rather [57:23] into a stand [57:25] and i can go from a down [57:27] into a stand by doing the same cue [57:31] so [57:32] tuck it in yes reward [57:36] under yes reward [57:40] yes reward your hand to the dog's chest [57:43] yes reward [57:46] yes [57:49] yes [57:50] i'm waiting for that butt to pop up [57:53] yes [57:56] yes [57:57] good [57:58] yes [58:01] yes good [58:06] next one's going to be heel if you're [58:08] working on precision style obedience and [58:10] you're going to do a competition heal [58:11] you're going to do a lot more than what [58:13] i'm showing right now all we want for [58:15] this is to show him how to find the heel [58:17] position the heel position is just going [58:19] to be on the left side of my body so [58:21] what i want to do for that is i'm going [58:23] to step back with my left leg i'm going [58:25] to use my left hand to guide him into [58:27] heel position once he's in the position [58:29] mark and reward so i step back there he [58:32] goes swing him back and then mark and [58:35] reward [58:38] this is an excellent exercise to do if [58:40] you want to do loose leash walking i [58:42] like to get the dog or puppy i'm working [58:44] with come on buddy used to going around [58:47] in the heel position getting the reward [58:50] and then i jump back [58:51] and i get him to go back in the heel [58:53] position excellent very nice i'll go [58:56] back again notice how his head goes out [58:58] this way [58:59] and around and in [59:01] that's the way i like to get them to [59:03] find the heel position the reason for [59:05] that [59:06] if you take your dog come on buddy [59:08] and you have him go like this [59:11] into heel position [59:13] then you're not going to get that pretty [59:14] flip finish [59:16] that you want if you're doing any sort [59:18] of advanced obedience but even with a [59:20] pet dog having a flip finish is very [59:22] nice [59:24] so that's when they're in the sit front [59:25] position directly in front of you [59:27] and you guide them around come on [59:29] come on you can do it there we go and [59:32] he's got it and they come back into that [59:35] heel position but when they fully [59:36] understand it then they'll just swing [59:38] their butt around [59:40] to each spot so i'm kind of helping him [59:42] out but you get the idea [59:44] that's going to be the heel [59:48] what i want to do is i want to step back [59:50] with my left leg guide her around [59:53] circle her head inward [59:55] and then reward her now [59:58] having your dog circle their head inward [60:00] is very important for this exercise [60:02] because if you circle their head [60:04] outwards [60:06] then that's going to become the default [60:08] movement that they do and you're not [60:09] going to have that really pretty [60:12] rotation of the back end coming into [60:14] heel position like that because we want [60:17] when they fully understand the heel [60:18] position we want them to flip their body [60:21] it's called a flip finish [60:22] into the heel position so again their [60:25] head comes inward i step back giving her [60:27] some room [60:29] and i can even reinforce the position a [60:31] little bit more by walking forward and [60:33] rewarding her okay guys this next step [60:36] is another fun simple step all we're [60:37] going to be doing is we're going to [60:39] guide our dog into the heel position we [60:41] want to give them a basic idea and [60:42] understanding of how to find that heel [60:44] position when we're taking them out on a [60:46] walk if you want your dog on the right [60:47] side you're going to do exactly what i'm [60:49] doing you're just going to put them on [60:50] the right instead of the left so when [60:52] i'm doing uh with the food i'm just [60:54] going to use the luring hey focus where [60:56] we're training buddy and i'm going to [60:57] guide them around stepping back with my [60:59] left foot bringing them into heel [61:00] position and rewarding good boy [61:03] same thing i'm going to use the leash to [61:04] do it i'm going to guide them around get [61:06] them in the heel position mark and [61:08] reward i have a video all on teaching a [61:10] dog to get into this position but this [61:12] is something that's going to help when [61:14] we take our dogs out for that loose [61:15] leash walking so again when we're using [61:17] the food we step back with the left leg [61:19] we guide our dog around once they're in [61:21] position we mark in reward when we're [61:24] using the leash very very similar we [61:26] step back we guide with the leash whoa [61:29] buddy and then when they get back in the [61:31] heel position we mark and reward so i'm [61:34] gonna do a couple just playing around [61:36] having some fun showing you guys what it [61:38] would look like when you're working [61:39] training with your dog it doesn't have [61:40] to be super serious and structured we [61:42] want to have a good time so if i'm just [61:44] doing food i'm guiding him into position [61:46] boom i'm rewarding him then i'm taking [61:48] off whoa [61:49] bringing him back in the heel position [61:51] mark and reward again i'm not worried [61:53] about [61:54] precision i just want him to have a good [61:56] time finding that heel position [61:59] so again when we're out on the walk he's [62:01] going to look for that on his own [62:03] and it's nice to do with the leash as [62:05] well so when he feels that pressure boom [62:07] he knows how to get into the correct [62:09] position oop that was sloppy got him [62:11] around [62:13] and again we want to do this a bunch of [62:15] times so [62:16] take the time to teach your dog how to [62:18] find that heel position and make it fun [62:21] make it very engaging let your dog have [62:23] a good time this is going to transition [62:25] over and make that loose leash walk that [62:27] much easier stepping back with the left [62:29] leg guiding our dog around [62:33] into that heel position so she's a [62:35] little [62:36] forging but that's okay it happens [62:46] yes [62:50] yes [62:55] the next one is the come when called so [62:57] with all i do is a little bow i drop [63:00] my body and i do a little bow [63:02] that little bow [63:04] brings the dog or the puppy directly in [63:05] front of me once they get close i lift [63:08] up which gets them to sit this is also [63:10] known as a backwards follow exercise [63:12] what's good about this is i could walk [63:14] backwards and just hand them treats the [63:16] whole time [63:18] so i'm gonna swing back around this way [63:20] and then anytime i want to stop all i [63:22] have to do is lift my hand up [63:25] and this is one of the first steps [63:27] to teaching [63:29] a come when called again we want to mark [63:31] when our puppy is doing it correctly as [63:34] i'm walking backwards i could mark [63:37] when he's coming towards me there's [63:38] different times when we can mark so i [63:40] could do this and go yes and give him a [63:42] treat [63:43] i could stop and lift [63:45] yes [63:46] give him a reward [63:48] i could even walk backwards [63:50] he's eating the food come on [63:56] and just reward him because he's getting [63:57] the primary the exact moment he's doing [64:00] it right [64:01] this also comes in mind with uh [64:04] reward placement notice how i'm giving [64:06] him the rewards very close to my body [64:09] because i want him to be close to me if [64:10] you're getting a habit of your dog [64:12] sitting in front of you and you're [64:13] reaching out to give them the reward [64:15] then that's going to be the position [64:16] that your dog or your puppy is looking [64:18] for in order to get those rewards so we [64:20] always want to reward them come here you [64:24] come on i know those other dogs can be [64:26] distracting [64:27] we want to reward them [64:29] when they're in the position [64:31] that's not a good position we'll try [64:33] again [64:34] he's a little distracted from the [64:36] neighbors dogs barking [64:37] so that's going to be our come when [64:39] called [64:42] when i walk backwards i'm just going to [64:44] reward him up against my body so i'm [64:48] just going to walk backwards he's going [64:49] to follow me [64:51] and as he takes his steps i'm gonna [64:54] reward him along the way [64:55] good boy come on buddy [64:58] nice job we can pivot around and go back [65:00] and forth and then as we stop we lift up [65:05] yes so they sit and then we go back into [65:08] the backwards follow exercise make sure [65:10] you don't trip over your climb bed [65:14] good [65:16] so we continue to walk backwards [65:18] continue to walk backwards rewarding our [65:20] dog and then again when we stop we try [65:22] to keep them nice straight and centered [65:24] slowly lift up and then reward this is [65:27] going to be the start of our come when [65:30] call [65:31] yes [65:32] yes [65:34] yes yes [65:37] and then stop [65:38] lift yes reward [65:42] and then once we know that we have the [65:44] dog doing that behavior and again i like [65:45] to get it to where i can walk backwards [65:48] and my dog is just walking directly in [65:49] front of me [65:51] yes [65:52] it's my body as i guide it downwards so [65:55] it's staying up against my body [65:57] and that's going to keep my dog nice and [65:59] close to me and i keep it center so i [66:02] can switch hands too [66:05] and i start with walking backwards again [66:07] this is the backwards follow exercise [66:09] but this is going to lead [66:12] into [66:13] the come when called [66:14] backwards follow [66:19] yes [66:23] so we've done sit down stand come heel [66:28] now we're going to do the climb command [66:29] again climb is anything elevated when [66:31] we're teaching the climb command it's a [66:33] great opportunity to also teach the off [66:35] command so what we're going to do is [66:37] take the food [66:38] guide them up on top yes then reward [66:41] take the food guide them off [66:44] showing them that we got it come on [66:45] buddy [66:46] oh oh there you go yes [66:50] and we're gonna guide him back up nice [66:52] job buddy [66:53] good boy this is a good confidence [66:55] exercise for him and back off one more [66:58] time come on coming oh [67:00] you can do it you can do it yay [67:03] and that's going to be the climb and the [67:05] off command [67:09] so i'm going to guide him onto the bed [67:11] yes reward [67:13] guide him off the bed [67:16] watch the pause yes reward guide him on [67:19] come on buddy [67:20] yes reward guide him off [67:23] lure him on [67:24] yes reward and the same time i teach the [67:27] climb i like to teach the off command so [67:30] guiding him off and reward guiding him [67:32] on and reward [67:35] just good girl [67:37] yes [67:39] yes [67:42] yes [67:44] yes [67:47] yes good [67:49] yes very nice [67:52] good boy buddy [67:54] yes good [67:56] yes good [68:00] yes [68:03] yes good [68:08] next one is the spin all we're going to [68:10] do is we're going to take the food and [68:11] get our dog to spin in a circle you can [68:13] go either way i like to only teach dogs [68:16] to go counter-clockwise and the reason [68:19] for that is when i have them in heel [68:21] position [68:23] oh you can do it [68:25] i gotta remember not to give them so [68:27] many pieces because it takes them a [68:28] second to chew all right so when he's in [68:30] heel position i like to have him spin [68:33] as a way to kind of break up heal a [68:35] little bit and make it more fun for my [68:37] dog so again i always get them to spin [68:39] counter clockwise now you may find with [68:42] a dog that doesn't have as much [68:43] perseverance they may give up [68:46] halfway through if that's the case [68:49] just start small reward right there and [68:51] then as he gets better reward a little [68:53] farther and as he gets better you reward [68:55] him the entire way so depending on your [68:57] dog's perseverance and motivation is [68:59] gonna really dictate how difficult or [69:02] how easy the spin is [69:03] so now we did the spin again another [69:05] very simple command [69:10] we're going to throw on the spin we [69:11] bring the their head around making a [69:13] full rotation now some of you guys if [69:16] you have a dog that doesn't have as much [69:17] perseverance meaning they give up [69:19] quickly [69:21] you may have to reward them when they're [69:23] partially [69:24] uh through the exercise so you might [69:26] have to go yes and reward there you [69:28] might have to go a little farther yes [69:30] and reward there because you build on [69:32] success and then she goes all the way [69:34] around yes and then we reward her again [69:36] we want to build on success if you're [69:38] trying if you do this and the dog gives [69:39] up [69:40] then you need to give them those wins so [69:43] they know that if they continue to [69:45] persevere they'll be able to get access [69:47] to the reward [69:49] so we show the dog our physical cue [69:54] yes [69:58] yes [70:00] again that's what i can do in the heel [70:01] position [70:03] yes good boy [70:08] next one is going to be walking [70:10] backwards so i've never had him walk [70:12] backwards yet so this is going to be a [70:13] first when i have my hands open that [70:16] means come to me when i close my hands [70:19] that means walk away or not walk away [70:20] i'm sorry walk backwards so i'll show [70:22] you how i do this i bring the food to me [70:24] or the puppy and then i close and i walk [70:26] towards him yes [70:27] once he takes one step backwards i mark [70:29] and reward i don't have to get him to [70:31] take 20 steps back just one in the [70:33] beginning so we close our fist we walk [70:35] towards him oh he fell if i need to help [70:37] him again [70:39] yes good so that took a little extra [70:42] help i had to use my left hand as well [70:44] yes good so he's walking backwards now [70:48] yes very nice [70:51] very good buddy go ahead get that piece [70:54] yes good so you see i'm just marking one [70:57] maybe two steps at a time when he gets [70:59] better at it [71:00] we can get him to walk back [71:02] way farther with less rewards so let's [71:05] try again close the fist walk towards [71:07] him yes [71:08] very good buddy [71:10] yes excellent nicely done i could also [71:14] say free googly [71:17] free very nice [71:20] all right another very simple one when [71:22] done correctly [71:26] so now all i'm going to do is i'm going [71:27] to close my hand i will walk towards her [71:29] yes and when i see her take those steps [71:31] backwards yes i mark and i reward [71:35] yes good girl so i can get her to come [71:38] back to me and then let's go ahead and [71:39] get her to walk backwards again yes very [71:42] nice good job harley [71:45] yes [71:46] good [71:48] yes a common issue that people run into [71:51] when they're trying to do this exercise [71:53] is the dog may try to sit down [71:55] yes what she is not doing it's making it [71:58] much easier but if your dog does sit [72:00] down just be patient with it and try to [72:03] move your hand manipulate your hand to [72:05] get the dog to do the behavior remember [72:07] this is our power steering oh boy [72:11] this closed walk into him yes good boy [72:14] his clothes walk into him yes [72:17] good [72:18] yes [72:19] excellent [72:20] yes very nice derby [72:27] come on come on you can do it [72:29] oh you're laying down [72:31] yes good boy [72:34] yes good [72:37] yes good again we can use the terminal [72:40] marker [72:41] free [72:42] good boy [72:44] nice [72:48] free good [72:51] free good [72:55] free [72:56] excellent good job derby [73:00] free [73:01] very nice [73:05] free good [73:08] excellent and that's a really good [73:10] session with derby here and when my dog [73:12] takes that jump back yes i'm gonna mark [73:15] and reward [73:16] yes [73:17] good i can use my terminal marker too [73:20] free good girl again fist closed walk [73:23] into our dog free [73:25] and as they get better you're gonna be [73:27] able to start getting them to walk back [73:29] farther and [73:30] farther hands closed and yes good hands [73:35] closed walk into the dog [73:37] free you can see she knows that when my [73:40] hands are closed that's when she walks [73:42] backwards [73:45] free good girl [73:50] free [73:53] free good [73:55] free very nice [74:02] free good boy [74:08] free excellent [74:10] all right so he's doing it really nice [74:12] it's picking this up quickly [74:16] free good boy [74:25] free very nice charlie [74:28] very nice [74:30] got a little spin [74:33] free good boy [74:39] free [74:40] excellent [74:42] fist close walk into him free reward [74:44] good job buddy [74:47] i got more it's okay [74:49] free [74:52] free [74:56] free [74:57] nice job bud [75:04] free excellent [75:06] good job hero [75:11] swinging out a little bit trying to get [75:13] him free to go straight [75:15] and again you can always use a barrier [75:17] so i'm noticing he's swinging his butt [75:19] to my right his left [75:22] so i'm just gonna use the banner here [75:25] free good [75:29] free [75:36] free [75:37] very nice [75:42] now we're gonna do the center command [75:45] center command is very fun dogs usually [75:47] love it keep that in mind if you're [75:49] going to teach your dog the center [75:50] command they do usually like it and they [75:52] will offer it up [75:54] sometimes when you may not be expecting [75:56] it so if you have a larger dog breed [75:58] keep that in mind you might be hanging [75:59] out talking to your friends and then [76:01] your dog comes and says hello right [76:02] between your legs so the way that i do [76:04] that is i keep food in both hands [76:07] the food that's in my right hand i do [76:08] not give to the dog right away i give [76:10] them the food that's in the left hand [76:12] when they get into the position so i'm [76:14] just using this hand to guide them [76:15] you'll see what i mean so i guide him [76:17] around he's not getting that food then i [76:19] switch them to my other hand now he gets [76:21] the food and now i can walk and give him [76:23] food from both hands [76:26] i can also have him sit by lifting up [76:28] so now you can see all these different [76:31] skills that we've been able to to [76:32] develop with spock here by using luring [76:35] can create a very fun very engaging [76:38] training session [76:42] but i'm going to use that to guide him [76:44] around transfer him over to my left yes [76:47] reward [76:48] yes reward good boy [76:54] the very last one we're gonna do is the [76:56] place bowl so i'm gonna grab that real [76:58] quick you can keep filming a little [76:59] spock running around [77:02] all right so now we have the place bowl [77:05] the goal with this he hasn't done this [77:06] yet either all i want him to do is place [77:08] his paws on the bowl once he places his [77:11] paws on the bowl i'll mark and reward so [77:13] yes [77:14] he's so easy all right let's get another [77:16] one yes very nice [77:19] very good now i can make it fun where i [77:21] can go free and release him let him come [77:24] and get it excellent and then let's go [77:25] back [77:27] free oh good boy at first we don't need [77:29] both paws one is fine [77:32] get him to do the other one [77:35] three oh good boy [77:38] nice job buddy we'll do one more he's so [77:40] easy now there's more that i like to do [77:43] with this [77:44] this helps teach our dog a little bit of [77:46] that rear end awareness a lot of [77:48] trainers also use this to help teach the [77:50] flip finish i also like to use this when [77:53] i'm teaching my healing sticks but this [77:55] is a good starting platform just to get [77:57] your puppy [77:58] to place his paws on the front of the [78:00] bowl [78:01] we can have him jump off come on big guy [78:03] go back [78:05] and put his paws on the bowl you could [78:07] do it there you go nice job and then i [78:09] like to just get them to pivot their [78:11] back end just like he's doing now and [78:13] again this is the very first time spock [78:15] has done the ball here [78:16] so again let's get him to go the other [78:18] way and i'm looking for that leg to turn [78:20] yes [78:20] or to step to the side rather [78:22] get him to go the other way [78:25] just by holding the food yes and you see [78:27] he has to change his position if he [78:30] wants to get to the food [78:32] in an easier way than trying to really [78:35] work for it so you see how i cup it in [78:37] my hand by turning [78:39] he has to turn his head which will [78:41] naturally get that back end [78:43] to pivot hey i'm up here [78:46] let's do one more get it a bit yes there [78:49] we go [78:53] so i'm gonna bring it over [78:55] and let's see [78:56] we can get her to put her paws on the [78:59] front of the bowl yes good girl [79:03] very nice yes so she's an easy one [79:05] that's good [79:07] and i'm going to keep rewarding her for [79:09] keeping her paws on there [79:11] very good that's good good girl [79:16] very good you're such a smart girl [79:18] aren't you now i'm going to have her [79:19] come off because i want her to get those [79:21] paws back on so we can repeat the [79:23] exercise yes [79:24] very nice so she's a very easy [79:27] dog to teach this to i've had some other [79:29] dogs where they do everything in their [79:31] power to avoid the bull and that could [79:33] be a little bit of a struggle but she [79:36] just places her paws right on it which [79:38] is very cool let's go back this way [79:40] sweetie and back this way let's get [79:42] those paws on there yes [79:43] good girl yes [79:45] see if i can get her to maintain it yes [79:48] by spacing out the markers yes [79:50] very good yes excellent and if the [79:54] bowl's too small that's going to make it [79:55] more difficult so i like to use a bowl [79:58] like this one this is a basic metal bowl [80:01] made by kong so it has the rubber on the [80:04] top and that makes it easier for the [80:06] dogs to have a little bit of traction [80:08] with their paws [80:09] the full metal bowls are a little bit [80:11] more difficult for them [80:12] i know trainers that will also use horse [80:14] bowls big horse balls to start out again [80:17] a bigger target's going to be a little [80:18] bit easier and the horse bowls are made [80:21] out of rubber as well so it's easier for [80:23] the dogs to maintain that position with [80:25] their paws so let's bring her around and [80:27] get her to put her paws back on it [80:29] since she's doing so well i'm going to [80:30] see if i can get her to pivot that back [80:33] end so i'm gonna get her paws on there [80:36] good girl very nice [80:38] cupping the food in my hand and i'm [80:39] gonna turn yes good girl so she's [80:40] turning her back in already [80:42] very nice [80:44] yes good you see that that is awesome [80:47] that's exactly what i want good girl [80:49] let's see if we can get that back in the [80:50] pivot yes good girl and we're gonna take [80:53] her back the other way all right here we [80:55] go you ready harley let's see if we can [80:57] go the other way don't get too bored [80:59] come on here we go here we go [81:01] come on [81:02] you can do it yes good girl [81:05] very good [81:08] come on can we get another step yes [81:10] excellent [81:11] again i'm just gonna guide them on i'm [81:13] waiting for those paws to go onto the [81:14] bowl [81:16] and it helps to teach the climb command [81:17] first [81:18] so you can see as i said some dogs will [81:20] avoid it [81:23] come on buddy come on [81:26] yes good job [81:28] you only got one paw on there that's all [81:30] i really need for right now i'm gonna [81:31] guide them back around and get them to [81:33] get both paws on there [81:37] come on buddy [81:41] yes [81:42] good so we got another paw [81:44] come on bud [81:45] come on come on come on you can do it [81:47] give him a little bit of encouragement [81:49] come on [81:51] you can do it buddy [81:53] yes very nice very nice good job [81:58] excellent lots of rewards there let's [82:01] guide them back on i'm actually going to [82:03] remove the leash [82:05] so it's not in the way [82:07] i come bud [82:10] good boy come on [82:28] come on babe good boy come on [82:31] come on come on [82:32] good boy [82:41] yes [82:42] good [82:44] good job very nice buddy so you can see [82:47] he's starting to get it come on buddy [82:49] buddy good boy let's get them to do it [82:52] again [82:54] come on [82:59] you can do it little man [83:10] and each dog is going to be a little [83:11] different [83:13] come on [83:14] come on buddy [83:20] i'm giving him a piece here and there [83:23] just because i don't want him to get [83:24] discouraged yes [83:26] good boy he's doing really nice yes [83:28] reward [83:30] and i'm also going to use the pivoting [83:32] that i did before to get him to pivot [83:34] his rear end on the bolt yes [83:36] good so that power steering is already [83:39] coming into play [83:40] and it's good to get our dog to be able [83:42] to pivot their back in again both [83:44] directions [83:46] come on buddy [83:49] the only difference from the power [83:51] steering is we're having him keep his [83:52] paws on the bowl come on [83:56] yes [83:57] good [84:03] i can help him a little bit yes [84:06] yes [84:08] good [84:09] good job buddy [84:12] now i'm gonna get him to place his paw [84:14] on the bowl and i'm going to use a [84:16] terminal marker [84:24] free [84:25] good boy nice job little buddy let's get [84:28] him to come back good boy come on come [84:30] on come on [84:33] free very nice very nice so he's already [84:36] getting it good boy come on oh you [84:39] dropped it little man [84:40] come on buddy [84:42] come [84:42] on [84:44] you can do it [84:51] come on [85:07] patience is key with this [85:11] come on bud [85:19] i'm gonna get one more good one because [85:20] he's getting tired come on [85:25] free very nice good job [85:29] girl boy you did it [85:31] it's been quite a while since i've done [85:33] this exercise with her but you'll see [85:35] once they have it they'll retain it for [85:37] a long time yes and she's already [85:39] offering it up and that's part of that [85:41] proactive dog training that we talked [85:43] about before place [85:45] so she knows to walk right on it and [85:47] again if i pivot she's gonna pivot with [85:50] me and stay in that sit front position i [85:53] can try to go back the other way [85:56] her other direction is not as good [85:59] come on baby there we go yes [86:02] and the reason why is because with her i [86:04] mostly did the left pivot because i [86:06] would use this bowl [86:08] heel [86:10] to work on that [86:11] flip finish sit [86:14] so i can place my dog nose sit [86:16] place her into a position [86:18] and then call her heel [86:20] and the heel and you can see [86:24] she uses the bowl as a platform to pivot [86:26] on this is also a great target location [86:30] heel [86:30] if i call her into heel position [86:33] i can send her place [86:38] to go onto the place command and again [86:40] even after not doing this exercise for a [86:43] long time free she's still really really [86:45] good at it if you imprint your dog [86:48] correctly that first 16 weeks [86:50] place [86:53] so she went for the center place [86:56] help rod a little bit then it really [86:58] sticks with them for life [87:00] again we teach them by placing their [87:02] paws on it we reward it so free i'm [87:05] gonna show you like when a dog starts to [87:07] learn it what it will look like so she [87:09] places free and then i reward [87:11] place i cure free then reward [87:15] place [87:16] free [87:17] very nice place [87:19] and then once we have that place stay [87:21] again we start to pivot around [87:23] getting our dog to pivot that back end [87:27] nicely [87:28] and i'm going to show you her doing this [87:30] behavior [87:31] right now when she was a young puppy as [87:33] well so you can see how it looks and how [87:35] they can advance [87:38] yes [87:42] yes [87:45] hurry [87:50] yes [87:52] good girl [87:56] yes [88:02] good girl [88:06] yes [88:09] so you can see very simple [88:12] very fun training and during this step [88:14] remember you're not worried about saying [88:16] the command [88:18] present the physical cue that can get [88:20] your dog or your puppy to do the [88:22] behavior every single time without fail [88:25] once you have it at that point then you [88:27] can move on to the next step which is [88:29] placing the behavior on a command and a [88:31] command can be physical [88:33] or verbal as long as it precedes the [88:36] physical cue because then it becomes a [88:38] predictable pattern and our dog's able [88:40] to learn so if you're training a new [88:42] puppy or if you're following along you [88:43] have an older dog start with this get [88:45] your dog get your puppy to do all the [88:47] behaviors that you like by using that [88:50] technique of luring you're going to [88:52] start with continual reinforcement [88:54] you're rewarding every single behavior [88:56] but once your dog starts to do the [88:57] behaviors on the command alone that'll [88:59] give you an opportunity to start spacing [89:01] out your rewards so you don't have to [89:03] give a treat for every little behavior [89:06] but we like to start that way [89:10] but i want you guys to see what a [89:12] training exercise might look like with a [89:14] brand new young pup so he's over here [89:17] trying to get into the bag of food come [89:18] here big guy come in yay good boy and so [89:23] with him he's following my hand already [89:26] really nicely so i can start luring him [89:29] into different positions when i'm luring [89:31] a dog into positions i'm not saying [89:35] the position that i want the dog to [89:36] perform i'm simply showing the dog a [89:39] physical cue and in this case we're [89:40] using the food to get them to do the [89:42] behavior [89:44] the moment they do the behavior [89:46] i can mark and reward here's another [89:48] thing to keep in mind when we're doing [89:50] luring we have to let oh is this a [89:52] little high for you [89:54] is it a little high come on you could do [89:56] it oh oh he climbed up and didn't [89:58] realize how high he was let's help him [90:00] out here we go oh there you go you did [90:02] it little super dog [90:04] nice work [90:05] when we're using luring so if i lift up [90:08] watch his butt hits the ground i can [90:10] give him that food within a second of [90:12] him completing the behavior same thing [90:14] with the down any command that i'm [90:16] trying to get him to perform come on [90:18] buddy [90:18] by using luring [90:20] we can just give him the reward once [90:22] he's in the position and we make the [90:24] connection however it is good to [90:26] practice always using those markers so [90:29] it would look like this [90:30] yes reward [90:32] and since he's not in a commanded [90:34] position yes [90:35] during this step i could use yes or i [90:38] could use free [90:40] free good job if i want him to come to [90:42] me come on buddy buddy buddy buddy very [90:44] nice [90:45] yes oh [90:48] there you go [90:51] yes [90:52] very nice [90:54] get him to come into heel position but [90:56] this is how i would do [90:57] an early session with this guy because [90:59] right now he's not ready for commands [91:01] but he's good with the markers and he's [91:03] good at following food [91:05] so i can start showing him [91:08] all these cool little things i can get [91:10] him to do with luring now what i [91:11] recommend before putting any sort of [91:13] command [91:14] on a command like before you say down [91:17] make sure you can get your dog to do the [91:18] command with that physical cue [91:21] the way that you like [91:23] every single time and once you have that [91:25] perfect picture then you can move to [91:27] naming a commander putting the behavior [91:30] on a command so for this next week all [91:32] i'm mostly going to be doing with this [91:33] little guy is engagement training and [91:37] teaching him how to get from one [91:38] position to the next using that concept [91:40] of luring i'm also going to show him a [91:42] few other things but it's all basically [91:44] going to be luring so if you're starting [91:46] and you're working with your puppy right [91:47] now or a brand new dog start doing this [91:49] take your time don't rush it get it to [91:51] where it feels like a dance where you [91:53] start to do something boom your dog [91:55] already knows what you want him to do [91:57] because you guys are so in sync with [91:58] each other with the training and it [92:00] makes everything go so much more [92:01] smoothly [92:05] clear communication is one of the most [92:06] important aspects when it comes to [92:08] training a dog last week we introduced [92:10] spock to luring which is implementing [92:13] positive reinforcement and this week we [92:15] will be teaching him leash pressure this [92:17] is incredibly important and we can use [92:19] it for so many different things such as [92:20] teaching behaviors preventing bad [92:22] behaviors and reinforcing good behaviors [92:25] such as our stay command this is so [92:27] important to dog training it's like [92:29] catching to football it's pretty [92:31] important so i'm going to show you guys [92:33] every little step so you can teach your [92:35] dog leash pressure and do in a way [92:36] that's not only effective but also fun [92:42] [Music] [92:45] leash pressure is implementing negative [92:47] reinforcement now when we're using [92:49] negative reinforcement the two most [92:51] important things you have to keep in [92:52] mind number one once the pressure is [92:55] turned on it cannot be turned off until [92:57] your dog complies and number two the [93:00] moment your dog complies you have to [93:02] instantly turn that pressure off your [93:04] dog has to know and understand that it's [93:06] the act of going into the position is [93:08] what turns the pressure off and if you [93:10] keep the pressure on after your dog has [93:12] done what you wanted then they're not [93:14] going to know what they need to do to [93:15] get that pressure to turn off it's very [93:17] important [93:18] last week we taught spock luring the [93:21] concept of following food to get into a [93:23] desired position you want to make sure [93:25] your dog understands luring before doing [93:28] this step it makes it much easier and [93:30] the way we're going to do this is i'm [93:32] going to start at his level because i [93:34] don't want to put a lot of extra [93:35] pressure on him and sometimes as the [93:37] human being much taller and much larger [93:40] we can add a lot of pressure when we're [93:41] standing over our dogs like this so at [93:44] first i like to get down to the dog's [93:45] level [93:46] i also like to teach the dog to move [93:48] forward that's the easiest one for most [93:50] dogs to do and a lot of dogs won't even [93:52] need the help with the food if you do [93:54] have to help with the food make sure the [93:56] pressure comes first then after the [93:59] pressure is applied help your dog figure [94:01] out what you want with the food when [94:03] your dog understands the concept they'll [94:05] move and follow the leash without that [94:07] extra help that you're providing in the [94:08] very beginning when you're teaching your [94:10] dog this process so i'm going to start [94:12] by pulling forward boom there's the [94:14] pressure now i help with the food good [94:16] boy once he starts to move towards it [94:18] come on buddy you don't want to jump off [94:20] the platform you can do it there come on [94:22] come on come on i know it's so high yes [94:25] and then i mark and reward i got him [94:27] back this way there's a yes good back [94:30] this way yes so now you see he's just [94:32] following the leash yes and that's what [94:35] we want [94:36] it's following the leash yes good so now [94:39] that he's doing this really nicely i'm [94:41] going to guide him back onto the [94:42] platform come on buddy [94:44] yes good job notice how each time when [94:47] he gets into the position i turn off the [94:49] pressure now we're going to do some [94:50] puppy push-ups we're going to go down up [94:52] down up down up a few times till he [94:55] understands this concept remember the [94:57] pressure comes first i like to keep my [94:59] hand behind my back [95:01] that has the treats because i don't want [95:03] to accidentally move at the same time if [95:06] you make this mistake of moving the [95:08] leash the same time you're luring with [95:10] the food then your dog's not going to [95:12] learn the leash pressure and of course [95:14] we're trying to teach the least pressure [95:16] so we're going to start to slowly lift [95:17] up there's the pressure just enough for [95:19] a little spock to feel it then we're [95:21] going to help with the food once he gets [95:22] into the position you can mark and [95:24] reward we're going to start the pressure [95:26] again there it is help with the food [95:28] yes reward pressure is turned off the [95:31] moment he complies we start to lift up [95:34] there's the pressure help with the food [95:36] yes and i will continue to do this until [95:38] i do the pressure and he goes into the [95:40] position without the extra help of the [95:43] food so we start the pressure first then [95:46] we [95:46] assist with the food yes reward if you [95:50] have a dog that already knows sitting [95:51] down and knows these commands but you [95:53] want to teach your dog leash pressure [95:55] you can replace the food with the actual [95:58] command meaning you could go like this [96:00] you could add the pressure and then you [96:02] could say sit [96:04] so your dog would sit and then you could [96:05] turn off the pressure the concept is the [96:07] same we're teaching him one thing by [96:10] using something he already knows to make [96:12] the training or the learning process [96:14] significantly easier so we're gonna try [96:16] it again looking beautiful he did that [96:17] one on his own i'm gonna show you what [96:19] it looks like if i was just training him [96:20] on my own [96:24] yes good job buddy very nice [96:30] yes excellent good job [96:33] very good [96:38] yes good boy very nice [96:46] yes good [96:47] so again you can see that i apply the [96:49] pressure then i help then i release the [96:51] pressure then i mark then i reward and i [96:53] add some praise so it should be a fun [96:55] exercise when your dog gets more [96:57] comfortable with you doing this exercise [96:59] at his level or her level then you can [97:01] go ahead and stand up [97:03] now that he understands what we're doing [97:05] i can start showing him a slightly [97:07] different picture [97:08] i also like to use my foot if you guys [97:10] have been following my videos you may [97:11] have seen this in some of my past videos [97:14] but i'll bring my foot up apply the [97:16] pressure make sure you have good balance [97:17] for this and then i help with the food i [97:20] like to use my foot so i don't have to [97:21] bend over a bunch of times when i'm [97:24] first teaching a dog this concept of [97:25] leash pressure so we're going to go [97:27] ahead and lift up sometimes we can talk [97:29] to them to help motivate them so i can [97:30] go come on spock [97:32] come [97:34] mark and then reward we'll do another [97:36] one where we use our foot bring your [97:37] foot up nice and slow let your dog see [97:40] it and then yes good boy [97:43] so that one he did without the help of [97:45] the lure and that's what we want so [97:47] we're going to do another one we're [97:48] going to go ahead and lift up [97:50] oh oh you're thinking about it come on [97:52] big guy you can do it [97:55] yes well we don't want to give him that [97:57] that's not a treat here we go that's a [97:59] treat very nice [98:01] and we're gonna do the leash pressure [98:03] again [98:04] with the foot yes so he's figuring it [98:06] out very fast he's also a very smart [98:10] intelligent dog and he's learning faster [98:12] than some other dogs would so with your [98:14] dog be patient don't try to compare your [98:16] dog's speed at learning or understanding [98:18] of the concept with spock here your dog [98:21] may figure it out faster your dog may [98:23] take a little bit longer whatever the [98:24] case is base the training on your own [98:27] dog that's a common question that's [98:29] often asked how long should it take well [98:31] it depends on your dog it depends on [98:32] your timing it depends on the reward [98:35] there's a lot of variables so just be [98:36] patient with it and have a lot of fun [98:38] now what can we use this for [98:41] we can use it for teaching commands let [98:43] me give you an example so i can tell [98:45] spock sit [98:46] then i can help him with the leash [98:48] pressure yes [98:49] mark and reward i can use it to [98:50] reinforce a stay so now if he's in a [98:53] stay if he was go if he was to break [98:55] this position i could easily bring him [98:57] back into the position showing him whoa [99:00] let's get back up here that was tough [99:01] we'll we'll consider that a [99:03] uh a fluke or whatever i don't know okay [99:06] so he's sitting we bring him back up [99:08] good so we can he wants to go into the [99:10] down position come on buddy and we can [99:13] give him that command down and then use [99:16] the leash pressure [99:18] yes reward [99:20] sit [99:20] use the leash pressure free [99:22] good [99:25] down use the leash pressure and he's [99:28] still not that good with the leash [99:29] pressure yet so i would wait till the [99:32] way that i like to do it is i like a dog [99:35] to understand this concept so much that [99:37] i can't even make the leash tight [99:39] meaning i start to do this [99:41] and the dog's already sitting i start to [99:43] lift up my foot boom and the dog's [99:45] already laying down that's when i really [99:47] start to incorporate it but like i said [99:49] i can also use this to not only teach [99:51] behaviors not only teach to stay help us [99:53] with walking on a loose leash but also [99:55] gives us the opportunity to show our dog [99:57] what they're not allowed to do without [99:59] having to give them a correction right [100:00] away and what i mean by that let's say i [100:03] have a dog that jumps up on people all [100:04] the time so i have the leash on them [100:06] it's nice and loose i tell my friend [100:08] let's say you're my friend i say okay [100:10] you're gonna pet my puppy but if my [100:11] puppy jumps up all i want you to do is [100:13] stop petting the moment you stop petting [100:16] and he jumps up i'm going to say wrong [100:18] then i'm going to apply leash pressure [100:20] once all four paws are back on the [100:22] ground then you're gonna go back to [100:24] petting him and what we're doing with [100:26] this is we're using negative punishment [100:28] which is removal of the reward we're [100:30] using positive reinforcement by petting [100:32] him when he does it correctly and we're [100:34] using negative reinforcement to [100:36] reinforce what we want by applying that [100:38] leash pressure first we teach the dog [100:41] that the behavior is not allowed by [100:43] using our marker that predicts negative [100:45] reinforcement this would be the word [100:47] wrong for the dogs that i train then we [100:49] would use the leash cue to show the dog [100:52] what we would like them to do so wrong [100:54] to the dog become stop what you're doing [100:56] or go back to the previous position this [100:59] is why this marker and leash pressure [101:01] training is so valuable we can give our [101:04] dogs proper directions without having to [101:06] correct them let me give you a few [101:08] examples [101:10] the dog goes into a room that they're [101:11] not supposed to go into i would say [101:13] wrong and then i would use the leash [101:15] pressure to cue them out of the room i [101:17] would do the same thing for jumping on [101:19] furniture jumping on people rushing out [101:22] of the crate or the front door or the [101:24] car and then we would use the leash [101:26] pressure to either stop what they are [101:27] doing or make them go back to the [101:29] previous location [101:34] a little derby here [101:36] i have the leash and again you're going [101:38] to see that i'm going to pull in a [101:39] straight line and i have food in my hand [101:41] as well so i'm going to start to pull [101:43] free and then i'm going to reward i'm [101:45] gonna pull free [101:47] and see how he's starting to follow the [101:48] leash [101:49] free good boy excellent work my man [101:52] free and now i'm not even applying [101:54] pressure he's just following it free [101:56] good boy this is a smart dog though [101:58] golden retrievers free are usually [102:00] really smart so you see i'm applying [102:02] pressure free and he's just following it [102:05] so he's doing great [102:06] free that's what i want and you also [102:08] when you're implementing this technique [102:10] you want your dog if they're paying [102:13] attention to be able to avoid the [102:14] pressure entirely i don't want to just [102:16] pull really quick not giving him an [102:18] opportunity to avoid the pressure i want [102:20] to start slow free so if he follows it [102:24] he's able [102:25] free [102:26] to avoid that pressure and that's very [102:28] important so now i'm going to do this [102:29] sit so what i want to do is i want to [102:31] help him with the food but i'm going to [102:32] lift up a little bit so there's the [102:34] pressure and that pressure needs to stay [102:36] until he puts his butt down it shouldn't [102:39] be so hard that you're choking the dog [102:41] it should be just enough that he feels [102:43] it so you can see [102:44] he's still able to smell the ground and [102:46] kind of look around i just want him to [102:48] feel a little bit of pressure so now i'm [102:49] going to help him with the food by [102:50] lifting up [102:51] he puts his butt down i turn the [102:53] pressure off and i give him a piece of [102:55] food i'm gonna encourage him to come [102:56] forward free and i'm gonna reward take [102:58] the pressure lift up then help with the [103:00] food [103:02] he puts his butt down [103:03] [Music] [103:07] free and then i reward good boy nice job [103:10] remember pressure must come first [103:12] pressure first [103:14] then the food [103:15] free then the reward so you see [103:18] pressure's turned off [103:20] oops i mean pressure's turned on [103:22] and then once he complies the pressure's [103:25] turned off so here we go again i lift up [103:28] and he's starting to get it already [103:30] free good boy that's a good job my new [103:33] man that's a good job so again i'm gonna [103:36] lift up [103:38] i'm gonna help him with the food [103:41] free good boy [103:44] good boy and if i want i can even throw [103:46] in some of that chase scene that we [103:48] talked about before come everybody [103:51] so again pressure [103:53] free good boy [103:56] good job get a little bit of that bounce [103:58] some of that puppy energy there's the [104:00] pressure let's lift up [104:03] free good boy and i want to continue to [104:07] do this until it's almost impossible for [104:10] me to make that leash tight because my [104:12] dog is so engaged and so focused right [104:14] now he's distracted and that's going to [104:15] happen with puppies but you're going to [104:17] see as they become more involved with [104:19] the training they start to enjoy it a [104:20] little bit more they start to understand [104:21] it more you're going to get more and [104:23] more engagement so here's the pressure [104:26] here's the food [104:28] free reward good job buddy pressure [104:33] food [104:35] free reward [104:37] nice work little man nice work nice work [104:41] pressure [104:44] food [104:45] free reward excellent good boy [104:49] that's a good boy [104:50] again pressure [104:52] free so that one i didn't even need to [104:54] use the food [104:56] pressure [104:58] food free good [105:00] so he's starting to get it there's the [105:02] pressure [105:04] free very nice [105:07] give him a little kiss he's doing good [105:09] free good [105:11] boy [105:12] so you see he's really starting free [105:14] he's really starting to get it now [105:17] once i have him at that point then i [105:18] want to start doing the pressure into [105:20] the down but i want to make it [105:22] comfortable so what i'm going to do is [105:23] i'm going to place him on the climb bed [105:24] here [105:26] guiding him with the leash [105:28] and i'm going to get down at his level [105:29] when i first do this exercise with a dog [105:32] i like to be at their level because i [105:34] want to [105:35] i want to alleviate as much pressure as [105:37] possible [105:38] contrary to popular belief [105:40] it's not about being the alpha it's not [105:42] about dominating your dog [105:45] take all that stuff that you've heard [105:46] before throw it out the window we're [105:48] working with our dog together on the [105:51] same team we're on a team right now and [105:54] i'm helping him and i'm trying to [105:55] communicate with him as effectively as [105:56] possible i'm not trying to dominate him [105:58] so what i'm going to do [106:00] we got a helicopter in the background [106:03] so what i'm going to do [106:05] here he laid down i'm going to bring him [106:06] back up right so i'm going to use the [106:08] technique to bring him up good he came [106:10] up so i'm gonna reward him now i'm gonna [106:12] do the pressure downwards so there's the [106:14] pressure downwards same thing as the sit [106:17] it's slow steady pressure i can help him [106:19] with the food free and then reward okay [106:23] i'm gonna bring him back up [106:25] help him with the food free reward [106:27] pressure goes down [106:29] free so he's starting to do it he's [106:31] doing really well we can even get a [106:32] little bit of a close-up so you can guys [106:34] can see what's going on here [106:36] and all i'm doing is i'm slowly going to [106:37] bring up the leash he feels the pressure [106:40] then the food comes remember [106:42] predictability pressure is predicting [106:44] food so then pressure is not stressful [106:46] pressure becomes something the dog [106:48] enjoys pressure goes down [106:50] food goes down and then we reward again [106:53] pressure goes up [106:55] food goes up [106:57] he does the behavior he gets the treat [106:59] pressure goes down [107:01] oh chew your food big man [107:03] he lays down i'm gonna give him that [107:05] reward [107:06] and then the next one and that's gonna [107:07] happen when you train your puppy [107:08] sometimes puppies and dogs [107:11] rather get the food in their stomach [107:13] than chew it properly before swallowing [107:14] so that happens so we get a little [107:16] pressure going up [107:18] pay attention big man and then the food [107:20] goes up [107:23] free then reward [107:25] again pressure goes down nice and slow [107:27] free [107:28] and then reward good boy pressure goes [107:30] up free he's doing really well pressure [107:33] goes [107:34] down i'm gonna see if he can do this one [107:37] without the help of the food [107:39] free good boy [107:41] let's try the sit without the help of [107:43] the food [107:44] sometimes when i'm doing the sit he [107:45] coughed up another piece sometimes when [107:47] i'm doing the sit without the help of [107:49] the food i'm going to help with my body [107:50] language a little bit so i'm going to [107:51] stand up [107:53] i can even do a little bit of [107:54] encouragement like come on [107:58] you can do it come on [107:59] come on buddy buddy buddy buddy [108:02] come on come on free good job [108:04] very nice [108:06] very nice [108:08] he's a really good smart puppy again [108:10] pressure down nice and slowly [108:12] free good boy [108:14] and then we're going to take them back [108:16] up nice slow steady pressure come on [108:18] buddy [108:20] come on [108:21] i'm helping them with the food this time [108:23] free [108:24] good [108:25] now i'm going to do a little bit more [108:26] but kind of all over the place so i'm [108:28] going to guide them off [108:30] free reward them there i'm going to [108:32] guide them into the sit again free [108:34] reward them there [108:35] guide them back onto the bed [108:38] free reward them there and something i [108:41] like to get them comfortable with as [108:42] well is using my foot to apply pressure [108:46] on the leash and this is so i don't have [108:47] to bend over so much if i'm working [108:49] larger dogs or older dogs so i'm going [108:51] to take my foot and i'm going to do slow [108:53] pressure nice and easy same as if i was [108:56] using my hand and then i'm going to help [108:57] with the [108:58] food once they lay down free reward i'm [109:02] going to bring them back up she did it [109:03] on his own beautiful bring my foot up [109:05] again nice and slow [109:07] slow steady pressure [109:10] and doing slow movements in the [109:12] beginning with any sort of exercise that [109:14] involves prep free [109:17] with any sort of exercise that involves [109:19] pressure it's going to help the dog out [109:21] because again we want to minimize the [109:22] stress [109:23] come on buddy [109:25] and help him back up [109:26] come on [109:29] and be patient with this exercise don't [109:32] rush it we want to take our time we want [109:34] to make sure [109:36] he's getting tired let's bring him back [109:38] up good [109:39] and then again i'm going to do my foot [109:41] bring the foot up [109:42] slow steady pressure [109:45] and then reward very nice good boy [109:51] welcome back to another episode today we [109:53] are going to start introducing the [109:55] verbal command to our dogs now if you've [109:57] been following my channel you've seen [109:58] this in a few of the other ones and it's [110:00] something i talk about a lot and it's [110:02] known as pairing or also known as [110:04] overshadowing this is the most common [110:06] mistake that most people make when they [110:08] start to give their dog the verbal [110:09] command so what they do is they say the [110:12] verbal command at the exact same time [110:14] they're given the physical cue for [110:16] example they go sit or down you may have [110:19] done that yourself now it's been [110:21] scientifically proven that if you pair [110:23] your physical with your verbal the [110:25] physical will override the verbal again [110:27] it's known as overshadowing so if two [110:29] things are presented to a dog at one [110:32] time whichever of those two is more [110:35] relevant to the dog is going to be what [110:37] they focus on and they're going to [110:38] completely ignore the other one and our [110:40] dogs notice physical movements way more [110:44] or much easier than our verbals so if [110:46] you want your dog to know the verbal [110:47] command this is very important the [110:49] verbal command must come before the [110:52] physical cue so instead of saying sit as [110:55] we lift or down as we point or heal [110:58] doesn't matter we have to say that [111:00] verbal [111:01] before the physical it has to be a [111:03] predictable pattern this is the same [111:05] with our markers remember our markers we [111:07] say yes [111:08] then we reward we say free or whatever [111:10] word you choose then we give that cue so [111:12] with our commands we say sit [111:15] then we lift our hands down [111:17] then we present the cue if you are [111:19] pairing it together your dog's not going [111:22] to learn now i have come across people [111:24] where they taught their dog the verbal [111:25] command even though they were pairing [111:27] you might wonder well how are they able [111:28] to do that if science has proven that [111:31] you have to say the verbal before the [111:32] physical cue it's simple they think [111:34] their dog already knows it on the verbal [111:36] command so they look at their dog and [111:38] they go sit the dog doesn't sit and then [111:40] they go sit [111:42] then the dog sits so the dog was [111:44] learning the verbal command because it [111:47] actually preceded the physical cue even [111:49] though they didn't know they were doing [111:50] it that way so you want to be aware of [111:52] this it should be broken down into four [111:54] parts command motivate mark reward on a [111:57] timeline command comes first [111:59] then the physical cue comes next then [112:01] the marker or you can give your dog the [112:03] primary within a second i've talked [112:05] about this as well and then if you use [112:07] the marker then you follow it up with [112:08] the primary so we're going to be [112:10] demonstrating with little spock here he [112:12] just got back from the vet clinic and he [112:14] doesn't like car rides so he drooled a [112:16] little bit but he's feeling better now [112:19] so we're going to start doing the [112:20] commands and i'm going to have you focus [112:22] on one thing at a time and then i'm [112:23] going to let you know what to focus on [112:25] after we do each part so it's going to [112:27] be broken down in a way that should be [112:29] pretty easy to follow so what i want you [112:31] to pay attention is notice how i say the [112:34] command then i do the q i just want you [112:36] to pay attention to that and i'm going [112:38] to go through a few commands with spock [112:40] here now the physical cue that i'm going [112:42] to be using is either going to be luring [112:44] or i might be using the leash pressure [112:46] cue as well i like to go back and forth [112:48] between the two and we're going to do [112:50] multiple different commands to make it [112:51] as interesting as possible so we're [112:53] going to get started right now good boy [112:56] so we give them a treat get him started [112:57] now notice i'm walking backwards he's [112:59] trying to get the food i say sit then i [113:02] lift free then i move [113:05] sit then i lift and i drop the piece [113:09] free then i move good boy even from [113:12] right here i can give him the climb [113:13] command so i go climb [113:15] then the q [113:17] now what helps a lot of people is to say [113:20] what you're doing [113:22] when you do it so what i mean by that is [113:24] say the command and then say what you're [113:26] doing so we can use the word now for [113:28] example so i can go [113:31] down [113:32] now [113:33] free [113:34] reward [113:36] come [113:38] now free [113:40] reward [113:43] spin [113:45] now [113:46] free reward [113:49] climb [113:50] now [113:52] free [113:53] reward [113:54] off [113:56] now [113:58] free reward now pay attention to when [114:01] i'm saying the marker i say the marker [114:03] the moment he completes the behavior i'm [114:05] trying to pinpoint the completion of the [114:07] behavior [114:08] down [114:09] now free reward [114:12] off [114:13] now [114:14] free reward i can use the leash pressure [114:17] as well now remember when we're using [114:19] the leash [114:21] it's not really [114:22] pressure it's more like a leash cue [114:26] we're using the leash to help guide our [114:27] dog into the position so for example if [114:30] i'm using my foot i'm not stepping on [114:32] the leash and forcing him into the down [114:34] position i'm using it as a queue so sit [114:38] now [114:39] free reward [114:41] also right there i said free and that's [114:43] the terminal marker he's conditioned to [114:45] it so he knows knows that free means [114:48] release and reward when we're first [114:50] teaching the terminal marker free we [114:52] move back encouraging the dog to come [114:54] get it so they understand that concept [114:56] but once your dog's conditioned to it [114:58] you can do something like this down [115:00] cue free and just hand it to him because [115:03] he knows it means release and reward so [115:05] if he wants to get up after he gets the [115:06] treat he can do that climb then the [115:09] queue [115:10] and i did not mark that one that's okay [115:13] sit then the queue notice the leash [115:15] didn't get tight when i use the cube [115:17] because it's a q [115:18] oops let's get that back to you big guy [115:22] sit q free reward [115:25] down then the q [115:27] oh free i didn't have to step on it it's [115:29] not force [115:31] the more we can communicate with our dog [115:33] the more techniques we have to [115:34] communicate with our dog the faster [115:36] they're going to learn and the stronger [115:37] the relationship is going to be [115:39] you don't want to ignore a technique as [115:42] valuable as leash pressure simply [115:44] because you think it's force when it's [115:46] not if you notice [115:48] i'm not using force to get him to do [115:49] these things it's just a cue sometimes i [115:52] don't even have to place my foot on the [115:53] leash because the dog has learned the [115:56] process of going with that pressure so [115:58] we're going to do a couple more and this [116:00] is another big question i'm asked is sit [116:03] when i'm training my dog [116:06] free [116:07] when i'm training my dog [116:09] am i just doing sitting down over and [116:11] over again no because that would be kind [116:13] of boring we want to make it fun so we [116:16] want to do as many different things as [116:18] possible when i'm doing a session with a [116:19] dog i'm doing everything trying to make [116:22] it fun so we're going to incorporate [116:23] these cones as well it's in one of my [116:25] other videos and that's the around [116:26] command which helps with certain sports [116:28] but it's also fun just to work with the [116:30] dog to give them more awareness of their [116:32] own body [116:33] so now i'm not going to say now anymore [116:36] but when you're first starting say now [116:38] after you say the command will help you [116:40] with your timing because again your mind [116:42] and your body want to move at the exact [116:44] same time he's trying to offer up [116:45] behaviors i mean think about it however [116:47] old you are your entire life you've been [116:50] pairing your physical with your verbal [116:51] and now i'm telling you not to do [116:53] something you've been practicing your [116:54] entire life for example when you go to [116:57] talk to your friends let's say you're [116:58] asking to go to movies you go hey guys [117:00] you want to go to the movies nobody does [117:02] this [117:04] hey guys you want to go to movies [117:08] it's not it's not how we operate so you [117:10] have to go against what you've been [117:12] practicing your whole life so we're [117:13] going to do a couple more come then the [117:15] queue [117:18] free then the reward [117:21] around then the queue [117:24] free good [117:26] and sometimes i just like to have them [117:27] go around these [117:29] mark and reward good boy [117:32] very nice [117:33] good job [117:35] backwards follow exercise i might throw [117:37] that in giving them some rewards center [117:40] we're going to throw the center command [117:41] in boom and now let's walk and have them [117:44] enjoy that center position see if we [117:45] could get a little bit of that prancing [117:47] by holding the food slightly higher [117:49] sometimes you can get that prance now we [117:51] can throw in a down then the queue free [117:54] reward good [117:56] spin cue free reward [117:59] heal queue [118:02] whoa ho ho i messed up come on buddy [118:04] we're this way now i got them in heel [118:07] position i can give them lots of rewards [118:08] for maintaining that sit then the queue [118:12] down cue free reward [118:16] all done buddy and when we finish a [118:18] session sometimes it's nice to let them [118:19] know that you're done [118:21] and if you do it like this if you do it [118:23] correctly you're gonna find that your [118:25] dog is going to start beating you into [118:27] the positions before you give that [118:29] physical cue so you'll be standing there [118:32] and you got your dog motivated ready to [118:33] learn and you say down and your dog goes [118:36] down before you present the physical cue [118:39] boom now you know you have it on verbal [118:41] but if you don't do it this way if you [118:43] go sit [118:44] down if you do that your dog will never [118:47] learn the verbal command and you will [118:49] always have to use the physical cue [118:52] so [118:53] one of the things i like to do to test [118:54] how good the dog knows the verbal [118:56] command is i will place them on a climb [118:58] platform [119:00] climb [119:02] and then he's not at this point but i [119:04] would stand [119:05] looking away and i give the dog the [119:08] commands [119:09] and i want to see if the dog can perform [119:10] the commands without me actually [119:12] presenting a physical cue and i'm going [119:14] to give you a quick little demonstration [119:16] with my dog ari down [119:20] stand [119:23] sit [119:26] spin [119:28] center [119:30] free yay [119:32] [Music] [119:44] and remember it goes command motivate [119:47] mark reward and each one has to be [119:49] separated by a split second on the [119:51] timeline [119:52] they can't be together [119:54] so we say [119:56] down [119:57] then we cue our dog free and then we [119:59] reward [120:02] climb [120:03] then the queue [120:04] free then the reward [120:08] off [120:09] then the queue free reward [120:12] spin [120:13] then the queue free reward [120:17] center then the queue [120:18] [Music] [120:20] free reward [120:22] heal [120:22] then the queue [120:26] free [120:27] a little early on the free there then [120:28] reward [120:29] down [120:30] then the queue free reward [120:33] stand [120:34] and the queue free reward [120:36] sit then the queue [120:38] free reward [120:40] set [120:41] cue [120:42] free reward you see how it's separated [120:46] if you had a timeline you'd see the [120:48] command down [120:50] then you'd see the physical key would be [120:51] next then the marker free and then the [120:54] reward so each one is separated what [120:57] most people do the most common mistake [120:59] is people pair they're physical with [121:01] their verbal they pair the command and [121:03] motivate they go [121:04] down [121:05] right [121:06] and then they say free and they reward [121:08] at the exact same time we want to make [121:10] sure that we separate it because if we [121:12] do it incorrectly it still almost looks [121:14] like we're doing it correct so for [121:16] example this is incorrect [121:18] climb [121:20] free [121:23] off [121:24] free and that's what most people do [121:27] b [121:28] all right [121:29] so i'm gonna go back to doing it [121:30] correctly [121:32] down two three reward [121:35] sit [121:36] cue free reward [121:39] spin cue [121:41] free reward [121:43] sit cue [121:45] heel [121:48] cue free reward [121:51] climb [121:52] q and remember i'm not worried about [121:54] perfect precision since it's service dog [121:56] training not competition obedience off [121:59] cue [122:00] free reward [122:02] center cue [122:05] free reward [122:06] down [122:07] cue free reward [122:13] set [122:14] cue [122:15] free reward good girl [122:18] spin cue [122:20] free reward [122:22] climb [122:23] cue [122:25] free [122:26] now when we first want to start naming [122:28] it we put our dog in the sit position [122:30] and we say come and then we go right [122:32] back into the backwards follow exercise [122:35] and always stopping the backwards follow [122:37] exercise by bringing our dog back into a [122:40] sit so then we can take a little step [122:42] back hands down come [122:44] cue the dog good nice job [122:47] get them used to walking with the leash [122:49] attached too unless you're training [122:50] inside but a lot of times i like to have [122:52] the leash just in case i need it [122:54] again we stop we lift up [122:57] yes [122:58] reward [123:00] build a little bit more distance [123:02] come [123:03] then the queue good very nice [123:06] excellent my little man come on buddy [123:08] don't get distracted none of that add [123:11] kicking in and then again we stop lift [123:13] up yes [123:15] reward [123:16] build a little more distance [123:18] come [123:19] then the q good [123:21] so you see everything has the exact same [123:24] process [123:25] right we teach the physical then we name [123:28] it build a little more distance come [123:31] then the q [123:33] good boy and if you're doing competitive [123:36] obedience this is going to be the same [123:38] so if you're working with a young german [123:40] shepherd or dutch shepherd or malinois [123:43] or something like that we can place them [123:45] into the position [123:46] call them to us come [123:48] sometimes i might move a little faster [123:50] if i want to increase the dog's speed [123:53] free [123:54] good nice job buddy nice job [123:58] place them back into the sit build a [124:01] little bit of distance [124:03] and notice i'm not using [124:05] the actual sit command we're just using [124:07] physical cues at this part but then the [124:08] command for the come so if he breaks it [124:11] it's not a big deal come [124:13] then the queue good boy and you're going [124:15] to quickly see that you will say come [124:17] and your dog is going to start running [124:20] directly to you to get into that sit [124:22] front position in order to get that [124:24] reward and we just keep doing it we [124:26] start to make our physical cue less and [124:28] less as we call the dog when they start [124:30] to understand it then i start i may use [124:33] the physical cue if i think the dog [124:34] needs it so if i'm walking backwards or [124:37] rather if i'm standing there and i say [124:39] come and my dog starts to come to me and [124:41] i notice my dog looks like she or he is [124:43] going to go to the right side of the [124:44] left side i might adjust and help them [124:47] right or i might call them and just do a [124:49] little bit of a cue but we want to get [124:51] to the point where we can call our dog [124:53] just stand there and they'll come [124:55] directly into the sit front position if [124:57] you do this correctly you'll be able to [124:58] get to that point in your training [125:01] now let me show you how to do this with [125:03] the leash pressure so very similar we're [125:06] going to take our dog swing our dog [125:08] around place our dog into the sit get at [125:11] the end of our leash [125:12] come [125:13] and then we're going to guide our dog [125:14] with the leash good boy [125:16] got him where we want him yes [125:19] and then reward and you could determine [125:21] you get to determine the level of [125:24] precision with your obedience if you're [125:26] just doing basic pet training so again [125:29] come [125:29] i can guide him with the leash and i can [125:31] reward him come on buddy chew your food [125:34] little man [125:35] i can just reward him when he comes to [125:36] me whatever you want the end pitcher to [125:38] look like some people are okay with the [125:40] dog just running into their area so you [125:43] match whatever it is that you want from [125:45] your dog [125:46] okay so again we place them into this [125:48] set and i'm just using the leash very [125:50] similar to how we did it using the [125:52] reward based training keep my hands down [125:55] come [125:56] then i guide my dog good boy very nice [125:59] and then place the dog into a sit yes [126:02] and then reward [126:04] sit as i step away [126:07] come [126:08] and keep good [126:10] and then let's bring it back up [126:12] yes [126:14] and then reward [126:15] that's going to be how we're going to [126:17] teach that come when called climb [126:21] using reward-based training or [126:24] pressure-based training both of them [126:26] work use the one that works best for you [126:28] and your dog sit repeat the sick command [126:32] take a step away build a little bit of [126:33] distance [126:34] come [126:35] and then [126:36] use the cue yes reward [126:41] come and then right back so she's going [126:43] to my hand so i'm not going to reward [126:44] her there [126:45] bring my hands behind my back if i need [126:47] to [126:48] yes [126:50] sit [126:56] come [127:01] yes [127:03] good girl [127:05] sit [127:08] build a little more distance [127:11] come [127:15] come [127:17] yes reward and each time break we're [127:20] trying to place our dog in the best [127:21] position possible [127:23] and every time i'm doing this i'm [127:25] looking more towards [127:26] competitive obedience you're not [127:28] competing with your dog you don't need [127:29] them to be in perfect position that i'm [127:32] demonstrating here [127:34] if you want if you're happy with your [127:35] dog simply coming to you to get a reward [127:38] then just do that gum yeah nice job [127:41] and you can give them the reward [127:43] you can make it as formal or as informal [127:46] as you would like it to be [127:48] free good girl [127:50] come [127:51] then i give the key [127:53] and i walk backwards [127:58] come then the queue [128:04] come then the queue [128:08] and once my dog gets better at that [128:10] what i want to do [128:15] is i want to start building distance i [128:17] like to use the climb again it's one of [128:18] the easier commands to reinforce the [128:20] stay [128:22] so just to make it easier on the dog and [128:24] easier on the training process [128:26] the more successful your dog is the [128:28] faster they're going to learn so now i [128:29] just create a little bit of distance and [128:31] i do the exact same thing [128:33] hands down at my side to kind of give [128:35] them that normal picture come [128:37] then the q [128:42] yes reward [128:43] climb i'm going to guide them back on [128:45] the climb [128:48] and all i'm going to do is i'm going to [128:49] add a little bit more distance [128:51] same thing hands down at the side [128:54] come [128:55] then the queue [128:58] yes rework [129:00] climb can i guide him back onto the [129:02] climb [129:09] now this time i'm gonna see how he's [129:11] gonna do if i don't [129:13] bring in my hands to help him out i'm [129:14] gonna stand right here [129:16] come [129:18] he needs a little bit of help [129:20] yes reward so we can help them when we [129:23] think that they need help or you can see [129:25] that they need help but you can see all [129:26] we're doing fine [129:30] because we're building business by [129:32] showing the dog the picture they already [129:34] understand [129:37] come [129:40] yes and come [129:43] you got a little confused there it's [129:45] okay [129:51] come then the queue [129:54] yes from the reward [129:58] come and the queue [130:02] yes then the reward [130:05] come [130:06] and then just like the other dogs will [130:08] build a little bit of distance [130:14] come thank you [130:22] it's not always going to be perfect make [130:24] sure you adjust if your dog makes [130:25] mistakes it's no big deal [130:27] come good [130:33] free [130:56] all right in today's video we're going [130:59] to be introducing the stay command [131:01] remember i do not use the word stay once [131:04] i place a dog into a verbal commanded [131:06] position it is required that they [131:08] maintain that position [131:12] all right and it's going to be very [131:14] simple what we're going to do is we're [131:16] going to command her onto the position i [131:17] always start with the climb command when [131:19] i'm first teaching a state [131:21] each climb command or each state command [131:23] rather [131:24] has a different level of difficulty than [131:27] the other one so for example the climb [131:29] command for me in my experience is the [131:32] easiest day to teach then the next one [131:34] would be the down then after that maybe [131:36] the sit [131:37] and then the stand stay or the heel stay [131:40] or the center stay they become more [131:42] difficult depending on what exercise [131:44] we're doing so i always like to start [131:46] with the climb stay the higher the climb [131:48] is the easier it is for the dog to [131:50] understand that that's the position you [131:52] want them to maintain so this is how i'm [131:54] going to do it and i do the same way [131:56] with every single stay command that i'm [131:58] teaching the dog i place them in the [131:59] position i use my continuation marker if [132:02] we're rewarding the behavior because i [132:03] want them to continue the exercise so in [132:06] her case it's going to be the yes word [132:08] then i'm going to walk away as long as [132:10] the dog stays in the position i'm going [132:12] to reinforce it by saying yes and [132:14] rewarding the dog with a piece of food [132:16] so instead of saying stay a bunch of [132:18] times as i walk away i'm gonna walk away [132:20] casually or how i would if i was [132:22] normally walking and then i'm gonna go [132:24] back and reward the dog by using my [132:26] continuation marker you'll see exactly [132:28] what i mean [132:29] if my dog or if harley breaks the [132:32] position i say one no [132:34] i calmly walk back to her [132:37] she bumped the the [132:39] camera i say one no i calmly walk back [132:41] to her i grab the leash and i place her [132:44] back on the climb stay and i will do [132:46] this as many times as it takes [132:48] when we're doing this we want to make [132:50] sure that we're not yelling we're not [132:51] getting excited we're not running [132:53] towards a dog i want to make sure that [132:55] my dog is at a clear mental state i [132:58] don't want them to be startled by what [133:00] i'm doing so i want to make sure it's a [133:02] very calm relaxed training session and [133:05] that's going to help them learn more [133:07] quickly so you'll see exactly what i [133:09] mean right now when i started with [133:10] harley and i've never done a stay with [133:12] her yet so harley come here [133:14] baby on it [133:16] yay very nice [133:17] so what i'm going to do is i'm going to [133:18] tell her [133:21] klein then the q [133:23] yes so i use yes this time and not free [133:26] so she maintains it yes i'm gonna reward [133:29] her by using continuation marker [133:35] no so there's my one note i grab the [133:38] leash i bring her back on good girl now [133:41] when the dog breaks the position and i [133:43] put them back on i don't reward them [133:45] right away i want to wait a few seconds [133:48] before i reward them like i just now did [133:50] because if you reward them right away [133:53] some dogs will learn break the position [133:55] yes get back on get a treat break the [133:58] position get placed back on get a treat [134:00] so i don't know [134:02] so i don't want to reward him right away [134:04] meaning like right now i wouldn't want [134:05] to reward her because then she might [134:06] offer up [134:08] the [134:09] mistake of breaking the position in [134:11] order to get rewarded so you see what [134:13] i'm doing i'm saying no [134:14] as she breaks the position [134:16] calmly grabbing the leash bringing her [134:18] back on good girl letting her know she's [134:21] doing it correctly if i have her stain [134:24] yes then i can use my continuation [134:26] marker and reward no [134:28] one know when she makes a mistake bring [134:30] her back on good girl when i know [134:36] i also like to no [134:38] and you're going to have it where [134:39] they're going to break a few times [134:41] and i also like to do it when i drop the [134:42] leash [134:43] yes [134:44] then i reward [134:45] [Music] [134:47] yes no [134:48] a no can override a yes so if you say [134:52] no if you say yes [134:54] and your dog breaks the position don't [134:56] reward them then no [134:59] and the reason why i like to do it this [135:00] way is i like the dog to learn no [135:03] their best course of action when they [135:06] break a position yes [135:07] oh see i rewarded too early i got [135:09] distracted talking so don't don't make [135:11] that mistake but um i want the dog to [135:13] learn when i say no yes their best [135:16] course of action is to either stop what [135:18] they're doing or go back to the previous [135:20] position yes [135:22] good girl so she's already starting to [135:24] figure it out yes no [135:29] no [135:32] [Music] [135:35] no and you should sound like a broken [135:37] record when you say no it should sound [135:39] the same just like everything else we [135:41] want our words to be as consistent as [135:43] possible yes [135:45] good girl very nice [135:48] now [135:50] good [135:51] the most important thing no with dog [135:53] training is clear communication as well [135:56] as trust [135:58] yes [135:59] she shouldn't be afraid of me when i say [136:01] the word no all it is [136:03] no it's just letting her know i'm gonna [136:05] come back and i'm going to place her [136:08] back in the position she was just in [136:10] yes [136:11] very nice [136:14] yes [136:15] good girl [136:18] no [136:22] also notice i don't repeat the word no i [136:25] don't say no no no a bunch of times [136:28] because i want the dog to know that when [136:30] i say no i'm pinpointing a moment in [136:32] time when the dog has made a mistake if [136:35] i keep saying the word then what am i [136:37] pinpointing if the dog breaks the [136:39] position and i say no and the dog tries [136:41] to correct themselves and i say no again [136:43] i'm like well that's incorrect and they [136:44] try this no no no ah and they become [136:47] stressed out we want to make sure that [136:49] we say it yes [136:50] the moment they make one mistake and [136:52] then we help them fix that mistake yes [136:55] no [136:56] boom now she's starting to go back into [136:58] the position and that's exactly what we [137:00] want good girl very nice [137:03] good job yes [137:05] that's my good sweet girl [137:07] and again each time i walk away nope [137:10] and this is all about showing her a very [137:12] very clear picture [137:14] we got the leash on her [137:16] you get that fixed yes [137:18] good girl it looks like she has a little [137:19] bandana on [137:21] are not bandana yes one of those little [137:23] workout straps [137:25] good [137:26] girl no [137:32] good [137:36] yes [137:40] yes [137:43] same thing with the yes when i'm walking [137:44] away i like to say yes [137:46] then i turn and i come back and i reward [137:49] the dog i don't want to get into a habit [137:51] of walking towards the dog and saying [137:54] yes i don't want to do this i don't want [137:55] to go [137:56] yes [137:57] because me turning then becomes the cue [138:00] i want my marker to be the indicator yes [138:04] that the behavior is correct and then i [138:05] want back and reward [138:08] no all right so she's starting to figure [138:11] out that she needs to fix herself yes [138:14] after i say the word no [138:16] and you see this isn't creating any [138:18] stress there's no confusion there's no [138:21] anxiety yes she knows exactly now not [138:24] exactly but she's getting there what i [138:26] want her to do and it's as simple as her [138:28] yes [138:29] maintaining that position [138:31] and i'm just gonna keep rewarding her [138:33] for holding that position [138:34] no [138:39] good girl [138:41] yes [138:43] so once i have this down and she knows [138:45] that she needs to maintain this position [138:47] then i would take the stay to the next [138:50] exercise which would be the down once i [138:52] get the down really nice the next one i [138:54] would do is to sit so on and so forth we [138:56] want to go through each commanded [138:58] exercise and because yes she starts to [139:00] understand the concept on the first [139:02] exercise it makes the more difficult [139:04] stays easier to teach because you've [139:06] already laid the foundation yes [139:09] with the climb stay so again all done [139:12] hold on baby break come on come back get [139:15] me now you want to stay there [139:18] look how good it works come on baby good [139:20] girl very nice [139:23] so those are the things you want to keep [139:24] in mind with this exercise you want to [139:26] make sure your dog knows a continuation [139:28] marker [139:29] you want to make sure you can get them [139:30] back into the commanding position by [139:32] using the leash [139:33] and then you want to [139:35] just be very calm relaxed [139:37] use you can use whatever word you like [139:39] if you don't like to say the word no [139:40] some people say wrong some people say [139:43] incorrect some people say [139:45] um [139:47] uh-uh or whatever it is as long as [139:49] you're consistent with that sound [139:51] then it should be pretty easy for your [139:53] dog to learn what it is you want them to [139:55] do so that's going to be our stay [139:58] command [140:02] the next portion of the training is [140:03] really simple and it's a lot of fun [140:05] we're going to place a harness on our [140:07] dogs and we're going to allow them to [140:08] pull and explore their environment this [140:11] is a very important step in the training [140:13] process because if we take our dogs out [140:15] the very first time and we expect them [140:17] to walk nicely on a loose leash there's [140:20] going to be more of a battle because [140:21] you're going to be competing up against [140:23] all these other distractions within the [140:25] environment so we want to go out there [140:27] we want to let our dogs pull we want to [140:29] let them get that out of their system so [140:32] then the obedience portion of the [140:34] training is going to be that much easier [140:39] all right now that we've given him some [140:41] time to explore the neighborhood what [140:43] i'm going to be doing in this step is [140:45] simply getting him to respond to the [140:48] leash pressure now that we're in the [140:50] front and we're walking around the [140:51] neighborhood so i have the harness in [140:53] case he does try to pull but the goal is [140:55] i want him to respond to the pressure [140:57] that i place on the leash that's [141:00] attached to his collar so i'm going to [141:01] start to pull a little bit once he [141:03] responds and turns my way i'm going to [141:05] mark in reward [141:07] [Music] [141:08] good boy [141:10] very good and again all i want him to do [141:12] is to respond to the pressure on the [141:14] leash so i pull [141:16] free good and i'm using his terminal [141:18] marker [141:23] free good job buddy [141:27] very good [141:32] and so now you can already see he's very [141:34] focused on me he's had a time to explore [141:36] the neighborhood so now it's not this [141:38] crazy new exciting thing that's one of [141:41] the biggest issues that people run into [141:43] they start to work with their dog then [141:44] they take their dog out into an [141:46] environment with a ton of distractions [141:47] and then they wonder why their dog's not [141:49] listening we have to build the dog up so [141:51] by exposing them to the environment [141:54] giving them an opportunity to see it is [141:56] going to make it to where it's not so [141:58] exciting that they're going crazy when [141:59] you're trying to do the training and [142:01] it's going to make this part much easier [142:03] so again all we're doing on this part is [142:05] we're out in front and we're just [142:07] getting them to respond to the pressure [142:09] on the leash once he responds [142:11] we mark in reward good boy [142:15] free good [142:17] and he's kind of finding the heel [142:18] position now on his own which is [142:20] excellent [142:22] so during this step your main goal is to [142:24] get your dog to respond to the pressure [142:26] on the leash and to get the focus from [142:28] your dog once you do that we're going to [142:30] take this skill on an actual walk so [142:32] let's go ahead and do that right now all [142:34] right now we got cash here and we're [142:35] ready to take him on a walk i'm going to [142:37] say heal then i'm going to step if he [142:39] starts to pull i'm going to stop him [142:41] with the harness first then i'm going to [142:43] use the leash pressure to guide him back [142:45] into the correct position this is [142:47] especially helpful for those dogs that [142:48] really like to pull because it's going [142:50] to help prevent them from pulling too [142:52] hard on their neck so we're using the [142:54] harness again to stop them from moving [142:56] forward then we use the leash pressure [142:58] with the collar to guide them back into [142:59] the correct position then we mark and [143:01] reward make sure the pressure on the [143:03] harness starts first we're actually [143:05] teaching them that the pressure from the [143:07] harness is going to predict the pressure [143:09] from the collar so eventually the dog is [143:11] going to respond on just the harness [143:13] alone so if you wanted to continue to [143:14] walk your dog on a harness and not a [143:16] collar you'd be able to do that after [143:18] teaching him this technique so again [143:20] we're gonna bring him back into the heel [143:22] position good boy tell him to sit and [143:24] then we're gonna say heal and off we go [143:27] again if he goes ahead of me [143:29] which he's not doing yet he's doing well [143:33] stop him with the harness bring him back [143:35] good boy [143:38] and then he's back in position so now [143:40] i'm going to demonstrate just how it's [143:41] going to look if i was out here training [143:43] him by myself so keep in mind the [143:45] details that i was explaining earlier so [143:47] we're going to walk [143:52] free good boy buddy [143:54] nice job [143:55] very good [143:58] if he's not paying attention i'm also [144:00] going to sneak out of heel position [144:01] there's the pressure good [144:03] good boy [144:05] very nice so you can see this doesn't [144:07] create any sort of stress [144:09] it's a very easy very comfortable walk [144:12] for the dog there's the pressure up see [144:13] now he's already responding [144:15] to just the pressure on the harness and [144:18] that's really what i want to see while [144:19] i'm doing this step [144:23] if you don't want sit [144:26] so what this is doing it's actually [144:28] teaching him not to pull [144:30] while he has a harness on and again i [144:32] use this technique for dogs that really [144:34] pull a lot and pull very hard because i [144:36] don't want them to choke themselves [144:38] however if you want your dog to pull on [144:40] a harness let's say you're exercising [144:42] your dog or you're running your dog [144:44] whatever and you want him to pull then [144:46] you don't want to do this because it's [144:47] actually teaching him not to pull even [144:49] with the harness [144:51] so if you [144:52] want your dog to pull when they have a [144:54] harness then you're going to do this [144:55] exact same step but you're just going to [144:57] use the collar you're not going to use [144:59] the harness the way that i'm using it [145:01] all right so let's go right back into it [145:02] heel and then we step [145:05] good boy buddy good boy [145:12] yes good job my little man [145:14] and if he's doing well if he's [145:16] maintaining position [145:18] yes i can mark and reward him right here [145:21] good [145:26] very good buddy very good yes [145:31] good job [145:36] sit yes and the nice thing is [145:40] if you teach your dog leash pressure [145:42] when you take your dog on a walk you can [145:44] start implementing basic obedience as [145:45] well so i could even tell him to [145:48] down [145:49] then do the cue with the leash pressure [145:56] yes [146:03] no [146:04] so he broke the position so i said one [146:06] no use the leash pressure put him back [146:08] in the position [146:12] no [146:17] good boy [146:19] sit yes nice job and then we're gonna [146:22] step right back out on the walk [146:26] hey up here heel then we step [146:29] good boy very good [146:35] and if he's doing well again we can huh [146:38] oh [146:39] good job you got me buddy that's what i [146:42] want i want the dog to to catch me [146:44] trying to sneak out of the heel position [146:46] we always want to make training fun and [146:48] we want to make it a game yes [146:50] good boy [146:54] so again both are nice and loose [146:58] good boy [147:02] oh he sees a birdie [147:04] good moe buddy [147:06] once he realized he wasn't able to get [147:08] to the bird he knew he had to respond to [147:10] the leash pressure so he turned around [147:11] and went back into the correct position [147:14] if you go to apply pressure [147:16] and your dog doesn't turn around [147:19] then you can correct for that [147:22] meaning [147:23] if i pull on the leash and he's not [147:24] responding to it i could say no pop the [147:27] leash and then apply the leash pressure [147:29] again he doesn't really need that so i'm [147:31] not doing that we got a cat up ahead so [147:33] i'm curious if he's gonna respond to the [147:35] cat all right here we go heel and then [147:37] we step [147:38] again making sure we say heel before we [147:40] step [147:41] if he goes ahead the pressure on the [147:42] harness first good boy [147:46] bring him back in the heel and then we [147:48] go back into the walk excellent [147:50] nice job buddy very good so there we go [147:53] and bring them back all right [147:56] yes good boy [148:00] very good [148:03] sit [148:08] heel [148:16] good boy [148:18] excellent work buddy [148:23] good again he's responding with just the [148:25] harness now at this point sit [148:28] good job [148:29] down [148:34] yes [148:39] no [148:42] so he broke the position so one no and [148:44] then i place him back into the position [148:50] and so he's distracted right now it's [148:52] just a matter of waiting them out a lot [148:54] of times if the dog doesn't do what the [148:55] person wants right away then they get [148:57] excited or they start repeating the [148:58] command or they get frustrated you just [149:00] wait them out sit and then we bring them [149:02] back up [149:06] heel and then we step good boy so even [149:09] with those distractions he still did [149:10] pretty good here's the pressure on the [149:12] harness good and we bring him back all [149:14] right nice job [149:15] excellent [149:17] all right so we're gonna keep doing this [149:18] for maybe another [149:20] five to ten minutes [149:22] and then i'm gonna switch to the next [149:23] step [149:29] now that he's been doing a really nice [149:30] job walking on a loose leash with the [149:32] assistance of the harness now i'm ready [149:34] for the next step we could take the [149:36] harness off entirely i'm not too worried [149:38] about that right now [149:39] basically i'm going to be doing exactly [149:41] what i was doing before but now i'm just [149:43] going to be using the leash with the [149:46] martingale collar when he starts to go [149:48] ahead of me we have two options we can [149:50] say their condition correction so a no [149:54] like i was using earlier when he broke [149:55] the down stay or we can recommand the [149:58] position we would like the dog to be in [150:00] so he goes ahead of us we can say heal [150:02] and we can bring him back praise and [150:04] reward them or he goes ahead of us and [150:06] we can say no or [150:08] or phooey or wrong and bring them back [150:10] whatever you want to do it really [150:12] doesn't matter to the dog because it's [150:14] literally the exact same thing to the [150:16] dog we're saying a word then we're [150:18] reinforcing what we're expecting our dog [150:20] to do so pick and choose which one you [150:22] feel most comfortable with and go from [150:24] there what i'm going to be doing with [150:25] him is i'm going to be saying no i'm [150:27] going to keep it nice and simple all [150:28] right so we're going to start and we're [150:30] going to say heal and then we're gonna [150:32] step if he's doing well good boy nice [150:35] job yes mark and reward [150:38] and again this is right after walking [150:39] him with the harness [150:41] good [150:42] and yes when they look up at me i like [150:45] to mark and reward that [150:47] if they get distracted [150:49] oh i got you [150:51] i make it a game well i'm gonna get you [150:53] again very nice buddy yes [150:56] we always like i said i can't stress it [150:58] enough we always want to make it fun and [151:01] interesting for our dog so he's doing [151:03] very well if he looks up at me [151:05] yes i could help him out by making some [151:07] silly noises but that's just showing him [151:09] hey if you look at me i'm going to pay [151:11] you for it [151:12] and if they look at us [151:15] they're less likely to fall out of heel [151:17] position [151:19] oh i got you again [151:22] and he's a goofy lap puppy good boy [151:25] yes [151:26] and like i said the nice thing about [151:28] implementing leash pressure is while [151:29] we're on a walk with our dog [151:31] good [151:33] yes [151:34] we can start implementing commands every [151:36] time i take a dog on a walk i don't just [151:38] take the dog on the walk i like to [151:40] reinforce everything that i've been [151:41] teaching the dog while at home sit so we [151:44] can use the sit we can keep them in a [151:46] sit stay if we want we can call them to [151:48] us so i can go come bring them to me sit [151:52] that wasn't the best come but we'll take [151:54] it [151:56] heel [151:57] step back off on the walk good job so [152:00] it's not just me walking on my phone [152:01] talking to my friend not paying [152:03] attention to my dog we're actually [152:05] hanging out together we're communicating [152:06] with one another and we're working [152:08] together on the same team he's starting [152:09] to go ahead oh he got me before i even [152:12] applied the pressure [152:14] and that's what we want we wanted to [152:15] start noticing [152:17] if we sneak out of heel position good [152:20] yes [152:21] excellent nice job buddy [152:23] very good [152:26] and so like i said he's already doing no [152:29] good boy [152:30] so i'm gonna start adding that no i [152:32] haven't been doing that [152:34] no then we good [152:36] and he's responding to just the no [152:39] excellent [152:40] in order for your dog to respond to the [152:42] no you have to make sure that no [152:45] comes before [152:46] you apply pressure excellent work cash [152:49] very nice so you can see [152:51] how loose the leash is another common [152:53] mistake that people make is the dog will [152:55] start to go forward [152:57] slowly and the human keeps walking [152:59] forward [153:00] the moment i notice the dog is not [153:02] paying attention to me no i walk out of [153:04] their heel position [153:06] i say no then i reinforce what i'm [153:08] asking the dog to do [153:10] and again we have to make sure our no [153:12] comes before we apply the pressure no [153:16] so there we go i said the no [153:18] i bring them back and you see when i say [153:20] no he's not worried that i'm saying the [153:22] word no because he doesn't know what no [153:24] means [153:25] in the dictionary he doesn't have a [153:27] dictionary that he's looking at it just [153:29] means whatever it predicts so in this [153:32] situation [153:33] the no predicts [153:35] no me going yeah come on buddy right [153:38] back here so it doesn't mean anything [153:40] bad to him [153:41] sit [153:43] good boy very nice [153:46] heel and then we step [153:48] so you can see [153:50] just by working with him and [153:52] communicating to him clearly we're able [153:54] to show him what we want no [153:57] and what we expect from him without [153:59] creating any sort of conflict or [154:02] avoidance [154:03] it's a very easy simple way to teach our [154:05] dogs so again they go ahead no [154:08] then we apply the pressure we bring them [154:09] back come on buddy you gotta itch you [154:11] gotta itchy [154:13] and then we go right back into the walk [154:16] if you have a dog that sit [154:19] continues to go ahead and you've done [154:22] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of [154:23] these and he continues to go ahead and [154:25] pull [154:26] you can give your dog a leash pop or a [154:28] correction for going ahead so [154:31] i'm going to show you example of what it [154:33] would look like and the correction level [154:35] will change [154:36] according to the dog so some dogs may [154:39] need a slightly higher correction some [154:40] dogs a lower correction so i'm going to [154:43] demonstrate with him and he's a very [154:45] compliant dog so this isn't really going [154:47] to be a correction but i just want you [154:48] to see what i mean [154:50] heel and then we step [154:52] so if he goes ahead i go no pop and then [154:55] i bring him back good boy so you see [154:57] it's a little snap [154:58] gives the dog a quick correction then we [155:00] go right back into the walk and we're [155:02] having a good time sit [155:04] good job buddy [155:06] heel [155:07] the main thing is make sure you guys are [155:09] patient with this one it could take a [155:11] lot of reps and you may find yourself [155:13] walking with your dog on the harness for [155:15] a week or so before transitioning to [155:17] just the leash it's really going to [155:19] depend on your timing and of course the [155:21] level of compliancy and intelligence and [155:24] motivation that your dog has remember [155:26] the science is always the same what [155:29] varies between each dogs are going to be [155:31] things like their intelligence and their [155:33] motivation their temperament their [155:34] disposition and that's where the art of [155:36] dog training comes in [155:41] and since we're on the subject it's [155:42] important to mention that each dog in [155:44] training should be in one of three [155:46] stages for each command first stage is [155:49] when the dog still needs the physical [155:51] cue to complete the behavior basically [155:52] the dog is still not able to do the [155:54] behavior on the command alone if you're [155:57] on this stage then you're still on [155:59] continual reinforcement the next stage [156:01] is when your dog is able to do the [156:03] behavior on the command alone when you [156:05] first enter this stage you'll do one of [156:07] two things when your dog does the [156:09] commanded behavior either you'll still [156:11] mark in reward or you'll give your dog [156:13] verbal praise such as good boy nice job [156:16] after doing this for a few weeks you'll [156:18] move on to the final stage of rewards [156:20] for each correct behavior you'll do one [156:22] of three options either you'll mark in [156:24] reward you'll give verbal praise or you [156:26] won't say anything at all no reward this [156:29] is the goal for each command that your [156:32] dog can perform the requested commands [156:34] but doesn't always need to be rewarded [156:37] for each correct repetition [156:42] part of being a dog owner is knowing [156:43] what to do in any situation this [156:46] includes accidents or unforeseen [156:48] illnesses for us dog lovers dogs are not [156:51] just our pets their family and we want [156:53] to be able to provide the best care [156:55] possible for them so they can live a [156:57] long and happy life if you're like me [156:59] then having pet insurance for your dogs [157:01] is a

traditional sense but [157:53] it is a step-by-step process that will [157:55] help give you a very clear picture of [157:58] what you need to do regardless of the [157:59] obedience or behavioral issue that [158:01] you're running into before moving [158:03] forward let's quickly discuss the [158:05] meaning behind some of the words i'll be [158:07] using in this video if i say anything [158:09] about corrections i'm referring to a [158:11] correction implemented with a training [158:13] collar such as a leash pop on a [158:15] martingale or prong collar or a [158:17] stimulation from a remote training [158:19] collar [158:20] yes equals reward which is positive [158:23] reinforcement free equals release and [158:26] reward again positive reinforcement [158:29] wrong equals leash pressure negative [158:31] reinforcement [158:33] no equals a correction positive [158:36] punishment and break just equals a [158:38] release [158:40] now let's check out the flow chart so [158:42] you understand how it works and where to [158:45] get access to it first you can find the [158:48] link to the chart in the description of [158:49] this video just click on the link next [158:52] to obedience and behavioral modification [158:54] flow chart the other option is through [158:56] my website nateshomer.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 330/841,com on the [158:59] homepage you'll see a logo with the [159:00] words dog training in bold with [159:03] obedience and behavioral modification [159:05] training plan click here below it when [159:07] you click on that link it'll take you to [159:09] the flow chart now if you notice you'll [159:11] see questions that are in bold font [159:14] these refer to the possible issues that [159:16] you may be having you'll also see option [159:19] one and option two underlined option one [159:22] will be for those of you that prefer not [159:24] to give your dog any kind of correction [159:27] for option two we'll be implementing a [159:29] correction to stop the undesired [159:31] behavior when it comes to working with [159:33] our dogs we have two main issues to work [159:35] through obedience issues and behavioral [159:38] issues we'll start with behavioral [159:40] issues the first one is your dog [159:43] practicing a dangerous or destructive [159:45] behavior [159:46] if yes then we have two options option [159:49] one prevent the dog from practicing the [159:51] behavior meaning you have to either put [159:53] up some sort of boundary or barrier or [159:56] you have to stop the dog every time they [159:58] do the behavior until they eventually [160:00] stop trying for example if your dog [160:02] chews on furniture you either have to [160:04] stop the dog every time they chew on the [160:06] furniture or you can prevent the dog [160:08] from even getting to the furniture in [160:11] addition you could use something like [160:13] dogs bitter apple no chew spray but i [160:16] prefer to go with option two which is [160:19] you can use a correction immediately to [160:21] stop dangerous or destructive behaviors [160:24] for example if your dog digs then you [160:27] can correct that behavior out of your [160:29] dog's repertoire but you have to be sure [160:31] to correct your dog when they are [160:33] digging not hours after the hole has [160:36] already been dug [160:38] next is the behavior based on fear if [160:41] yes then you'll want to implement [160:43] counter conditioning and desensitization [160:46] click on that blue link to learn how is [160:48] the behavior based on aggression [160:51] aggression is a very complicated issue [160:54] so i made a video dedicated to that [160:56] subject just click on the video link to [160:59] see that episode [161:00] is it a behavior you just don't want the [161:02] dog to perform such as jumping up on [161:05] furniture or going into an unauthorized [161:08] room such as a baby's room or an office [161:10] if yes then have you already trained [161:12] your dog and conditioned them to the [161:14] continuation and terminal marker if not [161:17] watch the two videos below and teach [161:19] your dog the markers and don't just skip [161:21] to the last step if you want to be [161:23] successful with your dog then it's [161:25] essential to make sure that you do the [161:27] required training for each step of the [161:30] training process here's an analogy to [161:32] put it into perspective if you stepped [161:34] on glass and cut your foot open you [161:36] wouldn't just put a band-aid on it and [161:38] call it a day no you would remove the [161:40] glass clean and stitch the wound and [161:42] then you would put on the bandage it's [161:44] the same when we're working with our [161:46] dogs we have to be sure to complete each [161:48] step before moving on to the next one [161:52] now [161:52] if your dog is already conditioned to [161:54] the markers or after you've taught your [161:56] dog the markers then we can move on to [161:59] the next step does the dog know and [162:01] understand how to follow a lure if yes [162:04] move on to the next question if no then [162:07] watch the three videos below and teach [162:09] your dog how to effectively follow [162:11] allure once that's completed does your [162:13] dog know and understand leash pressure [162:16] if yes move on to the next question if [162:18] not then watch these two videos and [162:20] teach your dog leash pressure before [162:23] moving on you want to make sure that [162:24] your dog is so conditioned to the leash [162:27] pressure that your dog will respond [162:30] before there is any pressure on the [162:32] leash this is why i often say that it [162:34] should be called a leash cue instead [162:37] check out this video i made for a client [162:39] a few months back to see what i mean [162:42] all right so basically what i was [162:43] telling you guys about what we're having [162:45] our session is the telegraphing or [162:47] letting your dog know what you're about [162:48] to do so watch for example how i do the [162:51] covenant call using the leash pressure i [162:53] start to walk out the leash [162:55] see that cues him to come and fall same [162:58] thing when i start to lift up you see [162:59] how he's doing it before [163:02] okay now he's a little slow on that one [163:05] but watch how i walk up the leash this [163:08] is letting him know i'm about to do the [163:09] leash pressure just like lifting my foot [163:12] up is letting him know i'm about to do [163:14] the leash pressure same thing when i [163:15] walk back [163:17] slowly walking up the leash good [163:20] to cue him on what i want him to do so [163:24] by telegraphing the leash pressure [163:27] it makes it much easier [163:29] for your dog to learn and respond [163:31] correctly to that pressure this is how i [163:33] like a dog to respond to the leash [163:35] pressure before i start correcting them [163:37] for refusing to respond to the leash [163:40] pressure one more time if it's further [163:42] down i'm lifting my leg up the dog sees [163:44] that and responds [163:46] i start walking up the leash and walking [163:48] towards the dog to get him to sit [163:50] walking back and walking up the leash to [163:53] come to me so super simple [163:55] has a dog been taught that the behavior [163:57] is not okay with leash pressure if not [163:59] then watch the three videos below to [164:01] learn how if yes then you can implement [164:04] either option one or two option one [164:07] continue using leash pressure to prevent [164:09] the dog from practicing the behavior or [164:11] prevent the possibility of the dog [164:12] practicing the behavior option two you [164:15] can use corrections to stop these [164:17] behaviors for example if your dog jumps [164:20] on the sofa the moment they jump on the [164:22] sofa you would say no and then you would [164:24] correct your dog with the training [164:25] collar after the correction you will [164:28] give the command you want your dog to [164:29] perform such as off if your dog still [164:33] doesn't perform the behavior you will [164:35] then use leash pressure to remove the [164:37] dog from the couch [164:39] now for obedience issues the first and [164:41] most common is your dog refusing to [164:44] perform a commanded behavior if yes then [164:47] does the dog know his continuation in [164:49] terminal marker if not then watch these [164:52] videos if yes does the dog know and [164:54] understand how to follow allure if not [164:57] then watch these videos if yes then does [165:00] your dog know and understand leash [165:02] pressure if not watch these videos if [165:05] yes then have you taught your dog the [165:07] verbal command by saying the command [165:09] first and then presenting the physical [165:11] cue meaning your dog will perform the [165:14] behavior on the verbal command alone and [165:16] you no longer have to assist with the [165:19] physical cue if not then watch these [165:22] videos if yes then move on to option one [165:25] or option two option one when the dog [165:28] chooses not to perform the command [165:30] within the first second say wrong then [165:32] use the leash pressure to make the dog [165:34] comply [165:35] option two if you give your dog a [165:37] command and they choose not to perform [165:39] that command the moment they decide they [165:41] aren't going to execute the command you [165:44] will say no [165:45] and then you will correct your dog with [165:47] the training collar [165:49] after the correction you will give the [165:51] command to your dog again if your dog [165:54] still doesn't perform the behavior you [165:56] will then use the leash pressure or [165:58] luring to place your dog into that [166:00] position [166:01] and last but not least does your dog [166:04] refuse to stay in a commanded stay if [166:07] yes then does the dog know his [166:09] continuation and terminal marker if not [166:12] watch these videos if yes does the dog [166:14] know and understand how to follow allure [166:16] if not watch these videos if yes then [166:19] does the dog know and understand leash [166:21] pressure if not watch these videos if [166:24] yes then have you taught the verbal [166:26] command for the position the dog is in [166:29] such as a sit stay the dog must know the [166:32] sit command on the verbal sit by saying [166:34] the command first and then presenting [166:36] the physical cue meaning your dog will [166:39] perform the behavior on the verbal [166:41] command alone and you no longer have to [166:43] assist the dog with the physical cue [166:46] if not then watch these videos if yes [166:49] then has the dog been taught that [166:51] breaking the stay is not allowed with [166:52] leash pressure [166:54] if not then watch these videos if yes [166:57] then if your dog breaks a stay and you [166:59] say wrong does your dog freeze in place [167:02] or go back to the previous position if [167:04] not then continue the last step until [167:06] your dog does if yes then you move on to [167:09] option one or option two option one when [167:13] your dog breaks the position you will [167:14] calmly say wrong [167:16] casually walk to your dog grab the leash [167:18] and use the leash pressure to place your [167:20] dog back into the position that was just [167:22] broken once your dog is back into the [167:25] desired position you will praise and pet [167:27] your dog petting is optional but don't [167:30] give your dog a treat or toy reward the [167:32] reason for this is that some dogs will [167:34] break the position on purpose so they [167:36] can get the reward when placed back into [167:38] the state position [167:40] option two when your dog breaks the [167:42] position you will say no but instead of [167:44] using leash pressure you'll give your [167:45] dog a correction with the training [167:46] collar even if the dog goes back into [167:48] the position on their own after you give [167:51] the physical correction you will then [167:52] command your dog back into the position [167:54] that was just broken if your dog fails [167:56] to do it on their own after the [167:58] correction you will assist them with the [168:00] leash pressure or luring you don't want [168:03] to continue to correct a dog for the [168:05] same mistake over and over again [168:07] once your dog is back into the desired [168:09] position you will praise and pet your [168:11] dog again petting is optional [168:13] but just like last time don't give your [168:15] dog a toy or a treat reward the reason [168:18] for this is that some dogs will break [168:20] the position on purpose so they can get [168:22] the reward when placed back into the [168:24] stay command [168:25] i hope everyone enjoys today's video and [168:28] it proves to be helpful let me know what [168:30] you think about it in the comments below

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 333/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:02] in today's video we'll be going over 10 [00:05] common myths about dogs [00:07] you can't teach an old dog new tricks [00:09] this is a very common myth and it's [00:12] simply not true [00:14] now some dogs very few are not trainable [00:17] and we'll discuss that next but for most [00:18] dogs this is a myth when working with [00:21] our dogs there are two main areas this [00:23] is going to be referring to obedience [00:25] and behavioral issues now you can train [00:27] just about any dog with obedience [00:30] if you follow the step-by-step process [00:32] that i teach in my manual as well as on [00:34] my youtube channel however when working [00:36] on a behavioral issue having an older [00:38] dog can change the process for example [00:40] if you have a young puppy and that puppy [00:42] starts to practice a bad behavior as [00:44] long as you stop the pup the first time [00:46] they try it they realize it's not worth [00:48] doing and it becomes a behavior of the [00:50] past but an older dog let's say you have [00:53] an eight-year-old dog that's been [00:54] chewing on furniture his or her entire [00:57] life now when we try to stop that dog [00:59] it's going to believe that it's a fun [01:01] activity because it's been doing that [01:03] behavior for so long and it's going to [01:05] take additional training to get the dog [01:07] to stop doing that behavior but it [01:10] doesn't mean that we cannot train an [01:12] older dog and it doesn't mean that we [01:14] can't stop an older dog from practicing [01:16] a bad behavior they've been doing their [01:18] entire life [01:19] every dog is trainable now most dogs are [01:22] trainable but not every dog there's a [01:24] great example in the book for the love [01:26] of a dog understanding emotion in you [01:29] and your best friend by patricia [01:30] mcconnell which i highly recommend and [01:33] i'll be sure to leave a link in the [01:35] description of this video if you'd like [01:36] to get a copy of her book she has a [01:38] story about a pit bull that at the age [01:40] of five weeks the first owners thought [01:42] that it would be funny to give this [01:44] puppy cocaine well of course it wasn't [01:46] funny it almost killed the pup and [01:49] caused significant damage to his brain a [01:51] year later patricia met this dog with [01:53] his new owner over possession-related [01:55] aggression in the first meeting with the [01:58] dog the owner dumped a bunch of toys on [01:59] the ground and asked patricia to watch [02:02] the dog's response was so extreme that [02:04] all they could do was watch [02:06] he would lunge forward and move at them [02:09] and growl even if they were to move [02:11] slightly [02:12] they worked with this dog and patricia [02:14] was determined to do anything that she [02:16] could to help she told the owner to [02:17] reach out at any time day or night and [02:20] that's exactly what the owner did the [02:22] following friday she called in a panic [02:24] according to patricia she sounded like a [02:26] kidnapped victim who had snuck away from [02:29] her abductor to call 911.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 334/841,long story [02:33] short [02:34] patricia and animal control friend [02:36] showed up just in time to help the owner [02:38] and secure the dog as karen puts it [02:41] overwhelmed with both adrenaline and [02:43] sadness karen esther and i stroked [02:46] frisco while he slipped off to his final [02:48] rest karen had done all she could to [02:51] give him a good life but i told her then [02:53] and i'll repeat it now frisco's first [02:55] owners had killed him long ago when they [02:58] fried his poor young brain it just took [03:00] him a long time to die [03:02] now this is an extreme and rare example [03:04] but as i mentioned most dogs are [03:06] trainable but due to early trauma such [03:09] as with this pup it is possible for a [03:11] dog to be rendered untrainable [03:14] it's all about how you raise them now of [03:16] course just like with humans nurture [03:18] plays an enormous role in the [03:20] development of our dogs for example [03:22] science has shown that simply touching [03:24] and holding our dogs often when they're [03:26] puppies in fact this seems to be true [03:28] with all mammals it can greatly increase [03:30] the amount of serotonin they produce [03:32] which in turn the less aggressive [03:35] they'll be as adults in addition the [03:37] more we train a dog as a puppy the [03:39] easier it is for them to learn new tasks [03:41] as they get older just look at the video [03:43] where i teach my dog ari to ring a bell [03:46] it literally only took her 15 minutes [03:49] now this has a big part to do with her [03:51] genetics but also the continued training [03:53] that i've done with her since she was a [03:54] puppy however nature also plays a [03:57] massive role there's a reason why most [03:59] police dogs are german shepherds [04:02] malinois and dutch shepherds and it's [04:04] not because of the way they look it's [04:06] because they have the genetic traits [04:08] that make them best suited for the job [04:10] in my dog training manual at the end of [04:12] chapter seven i have a chart that gives [04:15] the reader an idea of how genetics may [04:17] affect the training let's take a look at [04:19] one of them the large spectrum [04:21] represents the max amount that could be [04:23] reached in either direction a hundred [04:25] percent fearful on one side and 100 [04:28] confident on the other the smaller chart [04:30] represents that dog's individual [04:32] limitations meaning for this example he [04:35] or she could only get to 90 percent [04:36] confident even with all the confidence [04:39] building in the world and can only drop [04:41] to about 40 percent in confidence even [04:43] with zero confident training exercises [04:46] however like in the example with frisco [04:48] drugs and other dramatic events in the [04:51] early development of a pup could lower [04:53] that dog's genetic limitations this is [04:55] important to keep in mind when looking [04:57] for the right dog to fit your needs now [04:59] some of these points may seem like [05:01] common sense but many people need [05:03] reminders about these factors it's not [05:05] all about how cute your new pup is [05:08] if you lead an active lifestyle for [05:10] example get a dog that can keep up with [05:12] you you may want a vishla and that's [05:15] just one example of many breeds that are [05:17] excellent for an active lifestyle by [05:19] contrast if you lead a life that is less [05:21] active perhaps if you work at home on [05:23] the computer all day a visual may not be [05:26] a good idea instead a golden retriever [05:28] could be a better idea it would have [05:29] enough energy but it wouldn't go into [05:31] overdrive by never having an off switch [05:34] another factor is intelligence without [05:36] directly insulting any of our canine [05:38] friends the unfortunate truth is that [05:40] some dogs just are not as smart as [05:42] others now getting the most intelligent [05:45] dog could seem like the best idea but if [05:47] you don't keep that advanced brain [05:49] constantly working such a dog could [05:51] become destructive on the other hand a [05:53] smart dog could also be a great joy to [05:56] own these are again factors that depend [05:58] on your personal preferences and [06:00] lifestyle so as you can see it's not the [06:03] dog it's how you raise them is a huge [06:06] misconception [06:07] my dog knows he did something wrong [06:09] because he looks guilty the most common [06:12] story that i hear comes from an owner [06:14] that comes home there's a mess and the [06:16] dog is by the door looking guilty eyes [06:19] are squinting they're submissive the [06:21] head and tail is down usually the mess [06:23] is from the dog relieving themselves [06:25] chewing on the furniture or getting into [06:27] the trash the human assumes that the [06:29] body language is proof that their dog [06:31] knows they did something bad however [06:34] this body language is not guilt but [06:36] rather appeasement the dog has learned [06:38] that the owner is angry when there's a [06:40] mess however the dog hasn't connected [06:42] that it's the behavior of making the [06:44] mess that's causing the issue so out of [06:46] fear the dog cowers by the door hoping [06:49] that will prevent the owner from yelling [06:51] and getting mad at them this is why [06:53] clear communication is so important [06:56] here's an analogy i like to use to [06:58] explain this process to people let's say [07:00] that you became a prisoner of war in a [07:02] foreign country where you don't speak [07:04] the same language you have a prison cell [07:06] with a toilet you use that toilet every [07:08] day no issues one day you become bored [07:11] and you start to carve on the wall one [07:12] of the guards sees you carving on the [07:14] wall runs into your cell yelling at you [07:17] in a language you don't understand they [07:19] grab you and they shove your face into [07:21] the toilet are you going to think that [07:23] they shoved your face into the toilet [07:25] because you use the toilet or are you [07:28] going to think that they're shoving your [07:29] face into the toilet because you were [07:31] carving on the wall because that's what [07:33] you were doing [07:34] when they started to yell at you [07:37] my dog is untrainable and there is [07:38] nothing i can do about its bad behavior [07:41] as mentioned earlier some dogs are in [07:43] fact untrainable however this is [07:45] incredibly rare often the dog learns [07:48] that a particular behavior will result [07:50] in a specific outcome so they continue [07:52] to practice it which strengthens that [07:54] action and the owner simply doesn't have [07:56] the knowledge or experience to work [07:58] through the obedience or behavioral [08:00] problems to make matters worse if [08:02] something has been working for a dog for [08:04] a long time and one day it doesn't that [08:07] dog may amp up the behavior to get what [08:09] they want because in their mind the [08:11] behavior still works but suddenly [08:14] requires extra effort therefore it can [08:16] get worse before it gets better this is [08:19] known as an extinction burst the [08:21] behavior becomes more intense before it [08:23] drops off let me share a quick story [08:25] with you that illustrates this back in [08:27] 2013 i had a client that had a [08:29] two-year-old american bulldog this dog [08:31] did not like having a leash on him and [08:33] would fight to the nail to prevent [08:35] anyone from putting a leash on him or [08:37] keeping a leash on him when the dog was [08:40] eight weeks of age the owner reached out [08:41] to a local dog trainer unfortunately for [08:44] her and the dog she reached out to a [08:46] fake dog trainer i say this because i [08:48] looked up the trainer and this person [08:50] had no training or experience and only [08:53] used her dog training website to promote [08:56] her small hometown band during the first [08:58] session this trainer said this dog is [09:01] unfixable and you need to euthanize them [09:04] needless to say the owner did not [09:06] euthanize her puppy but she did give up [09:08] on training him at least until it got so [09:10] bad that she felt the need to hire [09:12] another trainer the first time i placed [09:14] a leash on this dog wasn't easy he [09:16] started jumping up biting at me as well [09:18] as the leash i refused to allow this bad [09:21] behavior to work kept the leash on him [09:24] and took him home for a training program [09:26] it took me about three weeks to get this [09:28] dog to accept the leash as a new part of [09:30] his life and during the process about [09:32] two weeks into training while on a walk [09:34] he decided to amp up the bad behavior [09:36] this was his extinction burst he first [09:39] tried biting at the leash as usual but [09:42] this time when it didn't work he jumped [09:44] up stood on his hind legs grabbed me by [09:46] my arm with his paws he was right here [09:48] and he growled directly at my face [09:51] i'll be honest i was a little nervous in [09:53] that moment but lucky for me this dog [09:55] was not actually aggressive he just [09:57] learned to act aggressively to get what [09:59] he wanted so i continued working with [10:02] him and now this dog can walk like a [10:04] true perfect gentleman while on leash [10:07] now i understand this is another extreme [10:09] example but things like this can and do [10:11] happen keep that in mind the longer your [10:14] dog practices a bad behavior the longer [10:16] it'll take to fix so don't ignore it for [10:19] two years and if you don't have the [10:20] tools to fix it yourself hire a local [10:23] professional dog trainer your dog won't [10:25] respect you if they sleep in your bed [10:27] dogs just like humans are social [10:29] creatures and dogs also feel a sense of [10:31] security when they sleep with the rest [10:33] of their family i've always allowed my [10:35] dogs to sleep at the foot of my bed and [10:37] never once have any of my dogs lost [10:39] respect for me and by lost respect i'm [10:42] assuming they mean the dog will no [10:43] longer listen to you if you train your [10:46] dog and work with them on a regular [10:47] basis your dog should and will listen to [10:49] your commands when a dog doesn't listen [10:52] to you it's not a sign that the dog [10:54] doesn't respect you but rather your [10:56] failure to train your dog lastly as my [10:59] good friend and exceptional trainer [11:01] bethany perdom says it's not a problem [11:03] unless it's a problem meaning if there [11:06] are no issues don't worry about it [11:08] however if your dog starts to resource [11:10] guard the bed now it's a problem which [11:13] would require some adjustments as well [11:15] as additional training i need to show my [11:18] dog who's boss by being the alpha i've [11:20] said this before and i'll say it again [11:22] having a dog has nothing to do with [11:24] being the alpha and everything to do [11:25] with teamwork in fact david meach a [11:28] professional wildlife biologist who is [11:31] the one that introduced the idea of the [11:32] alpha male in his 1970 book the wolf [11:36] later stated in a 1999 paper i conclude [11:40] that the typical wolf pack is a family [11:42] with the adult parents guiding the [11:44] activities of the group in the division [11:46] of labor system in which the female [11:49] predominates primarily in such [11:51] activities as pup care and defense and [11:54] the male primarily during foraging and [11:56] food provisioning and the travels [11:58] associated with them [12:00] in nature meech writes as offsprings [12:02] begin to mature they disperse from the [12:05] pack as young as nine months of age most [12:08] disperse when one to two years old and [12:10] few remain beyond three years [12:12] in the wild most wolves disperse from [12:14] their natal packs and attempt to pair [12:17] with other dispersed wolves producing [12:19] pups and start their own packs simply [12:22] put the male and female act as the pax [12:25] alpha because they are the parents so [12:28] just how parents try to educate and [12:30] guide their children so they can be [12:31] successful in life we as dog owners need [12:34] to raise and train our dogs so they too [12:36] can be successful in life [12:39] it's too early to start training my dog [12:41] often clients tell me that they didn't [12:43] start to train their puppy because they [12:45] thought or someone told them not to [12:47] train until the pup was at least six [12:49] months of age not only is this not true [12:51] but it's terrible advice the moment your [12:54] dog enters your house it is learning [12:56] from the moment that dog is born to 16 [12:58] weeks of age it is the most crucial time [13:01] in the dog's life this is known as the [13:03] imprinting stage and we want to make [13:05] sure the dog is learning the things we [13:07] want it to maintain as it grows into an [13:09] adult therefore it's essential to begin [13:12] as early as possible teaching the [13:14] concepts necessary to raise a puppy into [13:17] adulthood with excellent behavior if you [13:20] plan on doing advanced obedience with [13:22] your dog for example it's a good idea to [13:24] get them to enjoy that type of training [13:26] at a young age let's say you want to do [13:28] scent detection with your pup when they [13:30] get older so you'd want to start [13:32] training during the imprinting stage one [13:34] example of making this training more fun [13:36] for the puppy would be to make it [13:38] predict something the puppy really [13:40] enjoys like the pup's favorite toy this [13:42] would create a strong positive [13:44] association to the scent detection [13:46] training and it'll make it much easier [13:48] to create a strong scent dog when the [13:50] pup gets older you don't have to worry [13:52] about the puppy being proficient at [13:55] scent detection but you would want the [13:57] puppy to love the training that would be [13:59] the main goal this would be the same for [14:01] anything else you want the puppy to [14:03] excel at when they get older for example [14:06] i enjoy teaching my dogs the basics of [14:08] bite work because of this i start [14:10] teaching them how to bite a puppy tug [14:12] when they are only eight weeks of age by [14:14] making them enjoy the basics of bite [14:16] work when they're 8 to 16 weeks old it [14:19] can easily get them to do more advanced [14:21] bite work when they're older the main [14:23] idea is this if you want them to be [14:25] experts at something when they get older [14:27] make them love it when they're young [14:29] puppies [14:31] crate training is cruel [14:33] dogs are natural den animals and crave a [14:36] place of their own if you crate train [14:37] your dog correctly as i explain and [14:40] demonstrate in my how to easily crate [14:42] train your dog or puppy episode 24 then [14:45] it should become a home away from home [14:47] for them a place of comfort just like we [14:50] humans like to have our own bedroom so [14:52] do our dogs this is also a very useful [14:55] tool when potty training house training [14:57] and preventing separation anxiety when [14:59] you're not home [15:00] two important crate training principles [15:02] to understand [15:04] the first guideline for crate training [15:05] is that you always want to make the [15:07] crate a pleasant place for your dog and [15:10] never a place of punishment like as a [15:12] timeout or something of the sort giving [15:14] your dog treats in the crate such as a [15:16] bully stick or raw bone can help create [15:19] that strong positive association the [15:21] second important guideline is to never [15:23] put your dog in the crate only when you [15:25] are leaving the house or your dog will [15:28] learn that the crate means you are [15:29] leaving which can create anxiety and [15:32] further problems for the crate training [15:34] process playing tug will make my dog [15:36] aggressive [15:37] proper tug play will not make a dog [15:40] aggressive in fact i encourage people to [15:42] play tug with their dogs plane tug can [15:44] strengthen the bond increase the dog's [15:46] confidence and it makes an excellent [15:48] reward during obedience making the [15:50] training more fun and enjoyable [15:53] subsequently often causing the dog to [15:55] learn faster if you want to learn how to [15:58] properly play tug with your dog i would [15:59] recommend checking out my youtube video [16:01] the fundamentals of playing tug with [16:03] your dog [16:04] i hope everyone enjoyed today's episode [16:06] please like and subscribe if you need [16:08] one-on-one help i do provide zoom [16:10] training sessions all

Plus, don't miss the recommended bonus videos for even more training tips and techniques. Watch the full video now and start revolutionizing your dog's behavior today. In this video, I'll reveal my proven 3-stage process for gradually breaking the treat dependence and achieving real, lasting results. Here's how it works: Stage 1: Continual reinforcement. If you still have to bribe your dog with treats to get them to do the behavior, then you'll need to continue rewarding every correct repetition. Just think of it as a temporary crutch until your dog gets the hang of things. Stage 2: Once your dog is performing the command on the verbal alone, you can start spacing out the rewards. When your dog does the behavior the right way, you'll either mark and reward or provide verbal praise."

Stage 3: After about two weeks on stage two, you'll move on to the final stage. When your dog does the behavior the right way, you'll have three options: mark and reward, provide verbal praise, or say nothing at all. No petting required, but feel free to show your furry friend some love if you want to. Slowly over time, you'll reward less and less until you're finally free from the treat shackles. But don't worry, you'll still want to throw in some random rewards to keep your dog on their toes (and motivated). It's like a slot machine: the dog continues doing the commanded behavior for the hope of getting a reward. Just a heads up: if you never reward your dog, you might have to resort to using force to get them to listen. And let's be real, no one wants that. Training your dog should be a fun, bonding experience, not a chore. Keep those treats handy and you'll be good to go!

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 338/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in all of your videos you're just giving [00:02] the dog or puppy a bunch of treats how [00:04] about training without rewards or this [00:06] would be great if my dog is food [00:08] motivated but he's not how can i train [00:11] my dog if he doesn't care about food [00:13] now these are common questions that i'm [00:15] often asked and it's understandable [00:17] considering people don't want to carry [00:18] around treats all the time when they're [00:20] with their dog but first it's essential [00:23] to know that everything our dogs do is [00:24] based on motivation they're either [00:26] motivated to access something pleasant [00:28] motivated to prevent something [00:29] unpleasant or the behavior itself is fun [00:32] which is known as a self-reinforcing [00:34] behavior [00:35] whenever we're training our dogs we have [00:38] four different motivational tools that [00:40] we can use to get our dogs to do a [00:42] behavior [00:43] food toy affection and force [00:46] if you don't ever want to use food or [00:47] toys then you have two options when it [00:49] comes to training our dogs that would be [00:51] avoidance training this is when the dog [00:54] goes into a commanded position to avoid [00:56] a correction or you have escape training [00:58] this is where the dog goes into a [01:00] position to turn off pressure leash [01:03] pressure training could be an example of [01:04] this [01:05] once the dog completes the behavior you [01:07] then release the pressure praise and pet [01:10] them if you weren't going to be using [01:12] toys or food [01:13] now you can train a dog with either one [01:15] of these options but it would not be the [01:18] ideal process preferably you want to use [01:20] balanced training which is not only the [01:23] most effective it also produces the most [01:26] well-balanced dogs keep in mind that [01:28] when we ask our dogs to perform a [01:30] command they're doing it for one of [01:32] three reasons [01:33] either a it may predict a reward that [01:35] the dog is willing to work for [01:37] b they know that they will be forced to [01:39] do the behavior if they don't do it on [01:41] their own or c they know they will [01:43] receive a correction if they do not [01:45] comply now we want our dogs to want to [01:48] work because of the possibility of a [01:50] reward [01:51] before moving on if your dog isn't [01:53] willing to work for food then you want [01:54] to increase their food drive most dogs [01:57] low food motivation is caused by a few [01:59] things either the dog has been overfed [02:02] free fed given very high value foods [02:04] such as cooked steak or sometimes just [02:06] feeding out of a bowl can cause this as [02:09] a side effect the dog isn't interested [02:11] in food as a reward a common technique [02:14] is to simply make your dog work for [02:15] every bite of food [02:17] no more handouts for this you'll want to [02:19] use meal time as training time you bring [02:21] the dog out you offer them food to train [02:23] if the dog's not interested no big deal [02:25] put them away and try again at dinner [02:27] again if the dog is not interested no [02:29] big deal put the dog away don't give [02:32] them any more food and try again the [02:33] next day [02:34] continue to do this until your dog is [02:36] willing to work for the food be sure not [02:38] to give the dog any food between the [02:40] training your dog has to know that [02:41] they're only going to get food that they [02:43] work for now i've done this technique on [02:45] dozens of dogs and it's worked every [02:47] time [02:48] now in most of my training videos i use [02:49] what's known as continual reinforcement [02:52] this is when we reward every correct [02:54] repetition which is ideal whenever we're [02:56] teaching a dog a new behavior however [02:59] once the dog starts to do the behavior [03:01] on the command alone meaning no more [03:03] help with the physical cue such as [03:04] luring or leash pressure then we can [03:06] start spacing out the rewards allow me [03:09] to break down the most proven process [03:10] for getting a dog to obey commands even [03:13] without any rewards in sight first we [03:16] need to condition our dog to their [03:17] markers if you want a full understanding [03:19] of markers then check out my marker dog [03:22] training and the four quadrants of opera [03:24] conditioning video as well as engagement [03:26] training with a kali puppy video [03:29] once conditioned you want to start [03:31] practicing free shaping this is when you [03:33] don't have anything in mind that you [03:35] want your dog to perform but when they [03:37] do something that you like you mark and [03:39] reward that behavior for example you [03:41] have rewards hidden in your pocket that [03:43] your dog is unaware of and your dog goes [03:45] to their bed you like this behavior so [03:47] you say yes or whatever your marker is [03:50] then you give your dog a treat or your [03:52] dog looks at you again you mark in [03:54] reward or your dog just lays down again [03:56] we mark and reward [03:58] now our dogs did not see the reward but [04:00] their behavior made it appear what this [04:03] does is it helps create a proactive or [04:06] an operant dog which means a dog that [04:09] understands that their behavior has an [04:10] effect on their environment it also [04:12] makes our dog believe that we're a treat [04:15] dispenser that we always have something [04:17] of value even if we don't this way when [04:20] we ask our dogs to perform a behavior in [04:22] the future even if we don't have rewards [04:25] on us our dogs will comply next is [04:28] spacing out rewards during training i've [04:30] mentioned this in other videos but it's [04:32] worth discussing again when teaching a [04:34] new commander behavior you can follow a [04:36] three-stage process stage one is when [04:39] we're still having to present a physical [04:41] cue to get our dog to do a behavior such [04:43] as having to lure our dogs to get them [04:45] into the down position when on this [04:47] stage we are using continual [04:48] reinforcement so every single completed [04:51] repetition we're gonna pay our dog once [04:53] a dog starts to perform the behavior on [04:55] the command alone meaning you no longer [04:58] have to use the lure for example then we [05:00] move on to stage two during this stage [05:03] when your dog completes a behavior you [05:05] will either mark and reward as before or [05:07] you'll provide verbal praise but no [05:09] reward after working on this stage for a [05:12] few weeks or more then you're going to [05:14] move on to stage three when your dog [05:16] does the behavior correctly you will now [05:18] either do one of three options a mark in [05:21] reward [05:22] b verbal praise or c you'll say nothing [05:25] at all once you get to this stage you'll [05:28] slowly do less and less of option a and [05:30] b however you'll still want to keep [05:32] rewarding your dog randomly just not as [05:35] often they have to always believe that [05:37] there is a possibility that they'll be [05:39] rewarded if you stop paying your dog [05:41] entirely then eventually your dog will [05:44] stop working for you following this [05:46] process will give you and your dog the [05:48] success that you're looking for and [05:50] you'll have a dog that is happy and [05:51] willing to work with you in any of your [05:54] dog training endeavors i hope everyone [05:56] enjoyed today's episode please like and [05:58]

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 341/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] adria lafferty is a registered nurse and [00:02] graduate of the tom rose school she's [00:05] competed in tri dogs and protection [00:07] support association and igp currently [00:10] training in american schutzon she's been [00:12] working with pet clients sport working [00:15] clients and local police departments [00:17] recently relocated back to west virginia [00:20] and is starting up her business there [00:22] huge passion for helping owners [00:24] connecting and understanding their dogs [00:26] to improve the bond and their life [00:28] together she loves to work with canines [00:30] and working dogs with the love for the [00:32] german shepherd and the malinois breed [00:35] without further ado please welcome the [00:37] one and only adria lafferty so the first [00:41] one we're gonna be doing is puppy biting [00:43] puppy biting um almost everyone that has [00:46] a new puppy has this problem that we [00:48] have to sort through [00:49] so the first thing that i tell people is [00:52] just what you said they're all variable [00:54] some puppies are gonna be way [00:56] more into biting than other puppies um [00:58] but in general there's three kind of big [01:00] things we can do to stop this [01:02] um but the main concept is we want to [01:04] stop this behavior [01:05] so in order to be clear to our dog which [01:08] is what we always want to do we don't [01:09] want to live in that gray area i want [01:11] them to know exactly that i do not want [01:13] them biting my skin okay [01:15] for puppy biting we want to make this [01:17] something that the dog does not have fun [01:19] doing [01:20] one is with a leash you can attach a [01:22] leash to your puppy the second they [01:24] start to bite your skin and i mean the [01:26] second their teeth touch your skin they [01:27] should be getting [01:29] a [01:29] communication from you to say i do not [01:31] like that and i do not want that you can [01:34] do that with the leash by kind of [01:35] popping the leash [01:37] making little pops until the dog stops [01:39] doing what they're doing however most [01:41] dogs do not care about that enough to [01:43] really get that message that we don't [01:45] like that [01:46] the other thing you can do as well is to [01:48] just take your thumb stick it in the [01:50] puppy's mouth push slightly down and [01:52] back on their tongue they will pull back [01:54] from you that's your sign to say okay [01:56] they kind of understood that [01:57] communication what 99 of puppies will do [02:00] is come right back to kind of test that [02:03] again [02:04] so this but they'll come back a lot [02:05] lighter so they'll just touch you with [02:06] their teeth do it one more time and [02:09] you'll see them kind of click over into [02:11] all right biting is not fun okay now you [02:14] can do this um you know the hard parts [02:16] when they're biting your kids or kids [02:18] are not gonna effectively be able to do [02:20] this so i would use the leash in that [02:21] scenario [02:23] and now what about people that may not [02:25] want to use one of those correctional [02:28] techniques and this is something i've [02:30] mentioned as well because you will see [02:32] it on different videos and it's [02:34] redirecting them to a different toy now [02:37] that's something that i recommend to [02:39] people but i also let them know that by [02:42] redirecting them it's not going to stop [02:45] the behavior and it's because all you're [02:47] doing is you're giving the dog a [02:49] different toy [02:51] now [02:52] is that something that [02:54] clients have success with they just have [02:56] to constantly redirect what have you [02:59] seen from that yup these methods are [03:01] much quicker um the dog is going to get [03:03] the message much more quickly which is [03:05] what i always go for i want them to [03:07] understand right away what the [03:09] expectation is so that's a very clear [03:11] delivery you can um [03:13] redirect so if they come up to you you [03:15] can grab their toy and have them tug [03:17] with that instead of you almost like you [03:19] refuse to let them bite your skin we're [03:22] not playing that game in other words you [03:24] can get there that way as well you just [03:26] have to be ultra consistent because any [03:28] time they get over they start to bite [03:30] your skin again and you don't [03:32] sort of do what you need to do in order [03:34] to tell them we're not playing that game [03:35] they'll keep wanting to play that game [03:37] usually so as long as you're being clear [03:39] and you're consistent in your [03:41] redirection that usually works pretty [03:43] well for a lower drive dog there's some [03:45] dogs that are they're just going to keep [03:46] on pushing [03:48] yeah absolutely and i agree i like the [03:50] leash pop technique that's usually what [03:52] i tell people to go with and then [03:54] grabbing the lower jaw is another one [03:56] that i tell people to go with where you [03:57] hold it just enough to get the puppy to [03:59] pull away where they realize that's not [04:02] a fun game always with my own dogs i've [04:04] always redirected because i personally [04:06] don't care about the biting [04:08] but of course with some people they have [04:11] thin skin or they don't want their kids [04:13] being bitten by the puppy and the [04:18] desire to fix and correct that behavior [04:21] in a timely manner seems to stand true [04:24] with a lot of people so those are some [04:26] excellent techniques anything else on [04:28] that one are you ready for the next [04:29] question i think we can move on [04:32] okay oh one thing i want to add about [04:33] that sorry nate when you're using a [04:35] leash pop don't pop away from you that [04:38] dog usually takes that as like a another [04:40] play kind of signal they want to run [04:42] back and do it again pop into you and [04:45] they'll kind of be shoved in and then [04:46] have to pull back so it's kind of a more [04:48] clear way to do it [04:50] that's a great detail to add and that [04:52] makes me think of something else that [04:53] doesn't have to do with that question [04:55] but it's still worth no noting people [04:57] when they want their puppy to play with [04:59] the tug what do they always do [05:00] instinctively [05:02] they go to push it in the dog's mouth [05:04] and what does that do it does the [05:06] opposite effect the dog doesn't want it [05:08] shoved into their face so correcting [05:10] into the bite in a sense we're using [05:14] that technique [05:15] to get the dog and making it as clear as [05:17] possible which of course clear [05:18] communication is the most important [05:20] thing so you ready for the next question [05:23] all right dogs jumping up on people or [05:25] jumping up on furniture [05:27] so [05:28] as with everything you want to be clear [05:30] so jumping up on you this is another [05:31] good leash technique with the popping in [05:34] so if they jump up on you and we're [05:36] pushing them off and usually people [05:39] almost half pet their dog you know [05:41] they'll touch them push them off the dog [05:43] comes right back and then there's this [05:45] back and forth of the game and we get [05:46] frustrated so instead of pushing them [05:49] off of you use your leash and a lot of [05:52] us dog trainers um you know advise puppy [05:55] if you have a new puppy to let it drag a [05:57] leash around your house you have a quick [05:58] access to stop these things or correct [06:00] these things without having to play tag [06:02] or grab your dog so you could grab your [06:05] leash the second the dog jumps on you [06:07] the number one thing to do is not to pet [06:09] the dog we don't want the dog to think [06:11] we like that um you know so we don't [06:13] want to interact with the dog when it [06:15] jumps on us and pet it and hold its feet [06:17] and do all these other things with it [06:19] make a point right away grab the leash [06:21] say no pop pop pop pop towards you and [06:24] i'm not talking super hard pops it's [06:26] just a message so pop the leash towards [06:29] you to where the dogs almost pulled into [06:30] your body and they're gonna come off [06:32] themselves that distinction is very [06:35] important they're making the decision to [06:37] come off of you versus us pushing them [06:39] off okay [06:40] so that's a big distinction i always [06:42] pair no with it or whatever my you know [06:45] no word is some people [06:47] have different words but be consistent [06:49] what you use pull them towards you [06:51] you'll see them come off and then [06:53] they'll try and do it again usually [06:55] do it again and then anyone else they [06:57] jump on so if you're standing here and [06:59] they're not jumping on you they're [07:00] jumping on somebody else i'll do the [07:02] same thing but i'll make the dog sit [07:04] okay just so they don't then i can [07:06] reinforce my sit instead of them just [07:09] doing this jumping back and forth thing [07:12] definitely and something that i always [07:14] like to [07:15] as far as options [07:17] for people that view my channel and [07:19] learning how to train their dogs of [07:21] course not everybody [07:23] wants to correct their dogs now i'm a [07:25] true believer in balanced dog training [07:27] which corrections is a part of that [07:30] so for somebody that may not want to [07:32] correct their dog for jumping up what [07:34] could be an option for them to work [07:36] through it which as we know it will take [07:38] longer if they're not using the [07:40] correction [07:41] but [07:42] if it makes them happier about the [07:44] training then what's a good option that [07:47] you have for people that don't want to [07:48] use positive punishment in their [07:50] training yeah so you would consistently [07:52] not the dog will not get anything out of [07:54] jumping meaning they're not going to [07:55] jump on me and get petted they're not [07:57] going to jump on me and get food they're [07:58] not going to jump on me and get any sort [08:00] of interaction they want [08:02] so that may mean turning around and just [08:05] ignoring the dog um [08:07] sometimes you can almost act like you [08:09] know oh you know no and just kind of [08:11] walk away like you're uninterested and [08:13] the dog's kind of like oh geez well that [08:14] didn't get me anything it does take you [08:17] longer but if you don't give the dog [08:19] something they're wanting from that [08:20] scenario petting interaction food [08:23] whatever you have some toy in your hand [08:25] um they're not going to do it as often [08:27] after that and if they're if you do have [08:29] something in your hand and they're [08:30] jumping up to get that [08:32] i will make them sick and then give that [08:34] to them that way so they know you can't [08:36] take it from me and you're not going to [08:38] get it from jumping you're gonna get it [08:40] from sitting or [08:41] not jumping or doing anything else that [08:43] i'm asking you to do [08:45] so using negative punishment which could [08:48] take longer and then the faster results [08:51] positive punishment which is the [08:54] direction i recommend for people that [08:57] the dog jumping up could be dangerous so [09:00] what i always tell people when it comes [09:02] to this issue if it's dangerous or [09:04] destructive [09:05] then you definitely want to correct [09:07] right away [09:08] so let's say you have your grandparents [09:11] they come over often we don't want a [09:13] large dog jumping up on them if you have [09:16] younger kids you don't want the dogs [09:18] jumping up on them as well because in [09:21] these situations it can become dangerous [09:23] so those are corrections that we're [09:24] doing right away we need to eliminate [09:26] that behavior [09:28] but if you're a [09:30] you know young single person and you [09:32] have your dog and it's not a risk to you [09:34] then that negative punishment technique [09:37] could be a good option so thanks for [09:39] sharing that as well do you have [09:40] anything else you want to add on that as [09:42] for oh furniture as well yeah oh yeah [09:45] furniture too so in also with jumping on [09:47] people if i have somebody like a [09:49] grandparent or a young child that's [09:51] short and small that could really be [09:53] hurt by the dog jumping i'm gonna combat [09:55] it even before they jump so i'm gonna [09:57] have the dog on a leash before anyone [09:59] even gets there make the dog sit and [10:01] then try to structure your greetings [10:03] that way then you can catch the dog a [10:05] lot more quickly if they're going to [10:06] jump and you kind of get them away from [10:08] that scenario so you don't hurt anybody [10:10] with furniture so furniture is one of my [10:12] favorites because all of us [10:14] everyone thinks us dog trainers don't [10:16] let our dogs on the furniture [10:17] and we do um [10:19] we do our dogs live in our house and do [10:22] goofy stuff just like all of yours but [10:24] the big thing is that i can tell them to [10:26] get off and i invite them on so i do [10:29] furniture um and i don't even use a [10:31] leash for this most often i let the dog [10:33] come out if the dog goes to get up i [10:36] kind of stop them no get off i push them [10:39] off or make them get off physically [10:42] they get off and usually they'll kind of [10:44] put another pile up or creep back up [10:45] again no so i'm here i am with the [10:48] consistency no you're not getting up [10:50] here right now [10:51] once they accept that which is an [10:53] important step for me [10:55] they accept that and kind of move on or [10:56] they lay down or they don't try to get [10:59] up again here in the next couple minutes [11:01] i may say come on and i'll pat the couch [11:03] and either say up or whatever words you [11:05] want to attach to it come up come up [11:08] couch anything you want to say i'll let [11:10] them up now the other piece of it is to [11:12] get off so i usually attach the word off [11:15] to that so they know hey get off the [11:17] couch and i make them get off whether i [11:19] have to kind of scoot them off [11:21] or use their collar to kind of teach [11:23] them to get back off of the couch if [11:25] you're consistent with that um in the [11:28] hard parts when you have multiple family [11:29] members everyone kind of needs to be [11:31] consistent with that for it to really [11:32] work well [11:33] but if you're consistent with that then [11:35] your dog will they'll come over to the [11:36] couch and kind of look at you and wait [11:38] for your up command if you don't want to [11:40] let them up at that time you do not have [11:41] to and they can stay off and understand [11:43] maybe there's guests over we don't get [11:45] on the couch right now and that's how i [11:47] do couch [11:48] yeah and i prefer to do it that same way [11:51] too treating it as a command so if we [11:53] want to let them up we can give them [11:54] that command and if not we can tell them [11:57] off if they do violate the rules or at [11:59] least they know to wait for us and then [12:02] if somebody [12:03] never wants their dog on the couch then [12:05] they just do what you said as far as [12:07] anytime the dog jumps up we just don't [12:09] allow we say off and then whatever we [12:12] need to do to make sure the dog gets off [12:14] the couch [12:15] and of course [12:17] yeah and not letting the dog [12:20] manipulate the human in any way like [12:22] laying down and giving those puppy eyes [12:24] like i don't want to come off or the [12:26] other extreme where they might growl [12:29] and of course we don't want to leave [12:30] them up when they do that either because [12:32] then you'd be reinforcing the growl so [12:34] when you say off [12:36] you have to make sure you get those pups [12:38] off all right perfect anything else on [12:40] on that question [12:42] i don't think so [12:43] so the next question is going to be and [12:45] this is another big one of course well [12:47] these are all big ones separation [12:49] anxiety what can people do to prevent [12:52] separation anxiety from happening or at [12:54] least mitigate it depending on the dog's [12:56] genetics or if they are dealing with [12:59] separation anxiety what can they start [13:01] doing to [13:02] reduce that from their [13:04] yep so first i always tell people you [13:06] know separation anxiety is a [13:09] is a broad term for a lot of things um [13:12] some people think separation anxiety is [13:14] just whining when you leave that's [13:15] pretty common for dogs to do [13:18] um some what i see is big cases of you [13:21] know they're destructing the house when [13:22] you're gone things like that so in order [13:25] to kind of not go there i always tell [13:27] people when you get a new puppy [13:29] don't [13:30] you know put it in a crate while you're [13:32] there for 15 minutes half hour so it [13:35] starts to get used to the idea that [13:38] this [13:38] there's no like routine when you leave [13:40] because a lot of dogs get nervous when [13:42] they go to the crate because now [13:44] someone's leaving for a while okay [13:47] so if you get them used to kind of being [13:48] in the crate a little bit here and there [13:50] or [13:51] just teach the dog a place command teach [13:53] them something where they're not [13:54] following you like a velcro dog around [13:56] the house all day if you have one of [13:58] those that gets nervous when you even go [13:59] to the bathroom [14:01] so i usually try and help the dog kind [14:03] of learn you can be over here and i can [14:05] be over here and it's okay you know [14:07] and i'm sure you get a lot of separate a [14:10] lot of anxious dogs in and this is one [14:12] of the big things i do i get a ton of [14:13] these types of dogs in and a lot of [14:16] people are afraid to take them to [14:18] boarding they're afraid of separating [14:20] from the dog so that's one of the first [14:21] things don't be afraid [14:23] to separate from the dog the dog will go [14:25] through a stress period of course but [14:28] normally they will calm right down [14:29] they'll be okay once they get over that [14:31] little hump and if you do it while [14:33] you're home [14:34] you can mitigate any huge destructive [14:36] reactions like if you have a dog that's [14:38] tearing up crates or [14:40] furniture [14:42] you know you can simulate leaving you [14:44] can have somebody still in the house [14:46] kind of working with the dog and then [14:48] someone leaves they come right back get [14:50] the dog used to that kind of scenario [14:52] but also [14:54] when you're bringing up a new dog or a [14:56] puppy get them used to being separated [14:58] and it's not you know eight hours at a [15:00] time or it's not a big deal [15:03] show them kind of let them get through [15:04] it the place command works really well [15:06] for this with the dogs [15:08] that have really bad separation anxiety [15:10] like they turn into a nervous wreck when [15:12] you even leave the room [15:14] you know put them on a place and let [15:16] them be around while you walk through [15:18] your house and get away from them a [15:19] little bit and they're okay um the other [15:21] thing that can help with it is an [15:22] appropriate toy [15:24] that they like something to chew on [15:26] something to [15:27] mess with when their anxiety kicks in [15:30] because if they don't have anything to [15:31] kind of mess with they're gonna find [15:33] something to do usually do you have [15:35] anything to add to that nate [15:37] the the big thing is the routine you [15:39] know of course [15:40] you're always going to hear or at least [15:42] read articles where it says well the dog [15:45] might be bored the dog might not have [15:47] enough daily mental stimulation the dog [15:50] may not be physically active enough and [15:52] by doing these things [15:54] that could help which of course it can [15:57] if you are training your dog on a [15:58] regular basis often that does [16:01] minimize the possibilities of having a [16:03] lot of these issues but you nailed it [16:05] when you said people are gonna leave [16:07] their house and then all of a sudden the [16:08] dog picks up on these cues oh you're [16:10] grabbing your keys you're putting on [16:12] your jacket you're grabbing your [16:13] backpack or whatever it is and you're [16:15] leaving and now you're not gonna come [16:16] back till i don't know when and so they [16:18] start freaking out and yeah putting i [16:20] love using crates for this just putting [16:22] the dogs in and out of the crate [16:24] randomly throughout the day even if they [16:25] are house trained or potty trained just [16:27] to get them used to being comfortable [16:30] not having to be attached to the human's [16:32] hip throughout the day and yeah so i [16:35] think you nailed it perfectly a lot of [16:37] times it is caused by what we do as [16:39] humans but of course there are going to [16:42] be people that have issues where it's [16:44] genetics and just because it's genetics [16:47] of course doesn't mean we can't work on [16:49] it but we may have to take you know [16:51] longer [16:52] steps or more steps rather to get the [16:54] dog to that point so like i was thinking [16:56] about it with your daycare one i had a [16:58] client before that wanted to be able to [17:00] leave their dog at the daycare facility [17:03] but of course the moment that the owner [17:04] would leave the dog was freaking out and [17:06] that was causing issues so what i [17:08] recommended and luckily enough the [17:10] daycare facility was able to accommodate [17:13] this for them it was like a local one in [17:15] los angeles and so she would come down [17:18] with the dog and she would stay in the [17:21] building with the dog for a little bit [17:23] the dog can hang out see her [17:25] everything's good and then they would [17:27] leave and then she would go and then [17:29] leave and come back after a short [17:30] duration so she had to build up to get [17:32] to the point where the dog was confident [17:34] and comfortable with it but it's just [17:36] like you said it's taking those little [17:37] steps to get to that point and not [17:39] rushing it of course [17:41] yeah and if you make a big deal like you [17:44] know a lot of us when we come home you [17:46] know we're so excited to see our dog but [17:48] we do kind of the opposite when we leave [17:50] so we kind of get emotionally upset when [17:52] we leave the dog too because we're [17:54] worried about the dog being so anxious [17:56] while we're gone [17:57] so if you can kind of you know separate [18:00] that in your human brain as well to say [18:02] i'm going to be confident you're going [18:03] to be okay [18:04] you know see you later talk to you later [18:06] and walk out the door instead of the big [18:08] drama [18:09] i'll be back you know in a bunch of hugs [18:12] and kisses and we can do all that but if [18:14] you make a big drama you know change it [18:16] every day or get out of that routine so [18:19] the dog doesn't immediately go into that [18:20] mode that's another excellent point [18:22] people do do that as well when they [18:24] leave they hug they kiss their dog they [18:26] make it a big deal they do the same [18:28] thing when they get back and that could [18:30] create issues as well and if somebody [18:32] does that i always say go ahead and do [18:34] that but don't do it right when you [18:36] leave and don't do it right when you get [18:38] back [18:39] do it five minutes before you leave [18:41] that's usually enough time and when you [18:42] come back wait five minutes before you [18:45] give them the big hello walk in and just [18:47] be like what's up ari and then go about [18:50] your business and then five minutes [18:52] after that hey and give them all that [18:53] love and attention and so they're not [18:55] going to associate it with the coming [18:56] and going and of course keeping that [18:58] anxiety down all right the next i love [19:01] this one because we hear it all the time [19:04] and often it's [19:06] it's misinterpreting what the dog is [19:08] doing and we call it one thing and when [19:10] it's actually something else begging for [19:12] food [19:13] so begging's another thing um most dogs [19:16] are gonna do this when there's food [19:18] around especially if we give them food [19:20] from the table this is another common [19:22] thing that people think dog trainers [19:23] don't do that we do sometimes do i've [19:26] shared many a meal with my dogs but i [19:28] still don't like begging you know i [19:29] don't want to be something staring at me [19:31] right here while i'm eating and [19:32] breathing on my food things like that so [19:35] when you have a dog that's begging the [19:37] first thing you want to do is not create [19:39] it [19:39] so you're never going to get something [19:41] from me from my plate if you're sitting [19:43] here staring at me okay my dogs know [19:45] that [19:46] so you can teach that to your dog give [19:49] them a piece of food or you know you [19:50] don't even have to give them anything [19:52] off your plate you can have a little [19:53] their kibble sitting right there give [19:55] them a little piece of their kibble when [19:56] they're sitting over there on the other [19:58] side of the room if you want um i would [20:01] start it however by getting through [20:02] meals without them getting anything [20:04] there okay [20:05] keep just don't even pay attention to [20:07] the dog if they're coming up under your [20:09] feet or they are sitting incessantly [20:12] beside the table and you don't want them [20:13] there i would teach the dog a place show [20:16] them you can stay over here or tell them [20:18] to down or something away from the table [20:21] if they get up i'll say no get back over [20:23] there you know you can reward that way [20:27] you can go to them give them a piece of [20:28] food or a treat or their dog treats or [20:31] anything like that or you can wait till [20:33] you're all the way done [20:34] clean the dishes up do whatever you want [20:36] to do and free the dog off of their [20:37] place [20:38] or they're down or whatever they were [20:39] doing before you can kind of set [20:41] boundaries with this one wherever you [20:42] want them if you don't want them near [20:44] the table you can set a boundary that [20:45] they kind of stay away [20:47] if you don't want them if you want them [20:48] you don't care if they're near the table [20:50] you just don't want them staring at you [20:51] do not give that piece that food or [20:54] anything to them or even looking at them [20:56] and talking to them what do you want [20:57] what are you doing that keeps them all [21:00] right there beside you okay it's kind of [21:02] like a little reward in itself so i try [21:05] to never reward the behavior i don't [21:06] want even by accident so if that dog's [21:10] there and they're sitting staring i'm [21:12] either going to redirect them over to do [21:13] something else or [21:15] i will not acknowledge them at all and [21:17] you'll start to see that they they'll go [21:19] do something else because they're like [21:20] well this isn't what i thought it was [21:22] going to be here [21:23] and um the place command works wonders [21:25] for this if you want to train that [21:27] yeah definitely i love the place command [21:29] that's my favorite go-to when it comes [21:31] to begging and ignoring them that can [21:34] work as well but of course that could [21:35] take longer the good thing is our dogs [21:38] are very situational so often because i [21:41] encourage people to always do engagement [21:43] training or loading the markers whatever [21:46] it is that we want to call it and when [21:48] we do engagement training of course [21:50] we're paying our dogs to look at us [21:52] so when we have food in our hand and [21:54] we're first starting to train the dog [21:56] goes oh you have food i look at you i [21:58] get some of that food so then we sit [22:01] down at the dinner table the dog goes oh [22:03] you got food i look at you you hook me [22:06] up with some of that food [22:08] so that's why i love the climb command i [22:10] tell everybody this either put the dog [22:12] on a climb [22:14] basically tell the dog what you want [22:15] them to do in that situation because if [22:18] we've done that engagement training [22:20] they're going to want to come over and [22:21] stare at us they're like hey we got a [22:23] deal right i look at you you hook me up [22:25] you know this is how it works out and [22:27] that's why i was saying that it's it's [22:28] good how situational dogs are because [22:31] they can't separate the two and go okay [22:33] when you're sitting down with your plate [22:35] of food i'm not gonna get anything and [22:37] often what ends up happening like you [22:39] said they get bored walk away and lay [22:40] down [22:41] it's kind of funny random quick story [22:43] this was before i was a dog trainer my [22:46] golden retriever she i would give her [22:48] pieces of food all the time and often i [22:51] would eat when i would give her her meal [22:54] so i would set down her bowl of food and [22:55] then i would sit down with my food she'd [22:57] watch me the entire time [22:59] just in case i'd give her a piece and [23:01] once i was done and i take my plate to [23:04] the sink to clean it once i went to the [23:06] sink she knew that she wasn't getting [23:07] anymore and that's when she would go and [23:09] eat her food but she would always sit [23:11] there and wait hoping she would get some [23:13] of my food because of course she enjoyed [23:15] it more than her food which was always [23:17] pretty funny all right moving on [23:20] last question and this is another big [23:22] one of course [23:23] destructive behaviors whether it's [23:26] ripping up toilet paper [23:28] chewing up the carpet chewing on [23:30] furniture [23:32] people run into this issue all the time [23:34] would have been the techniques that [23:35] you've used that's been most successful [23:37] with this [23:38] so the funny part about destructive [23:40] behavior really a lot of these um you [23:43] know common issues are [23:46] there's a simple part and a hard part [23:47] the hard part is you've got to see it in [23:50] order to correct it so a lot of people [23:52] just don't watch their dog their dog has [23:55] already done the thing long before they [23:56] know you know the toilet paper is [23:58] already clear across the room for half [23:59] an hour before we even catch the dog [24:01] doing it so you want to if you have a [24:03] dog that's becoming destructive number [24:05] one crates will help you tremendously [24:07] crate training if it's when you're [24:09] leaving okay [24:11] if you leave your house and your dog is [24:12] destroying the house while you're gone a [24:14] crate will do wonders for that um [24:16] behavior and sometimes if you can view [24:18] it as in that scenario when you have [24:20] when you leave the house and you have a [24:21] destructive dog we can't see when [24:23] they're doing it we can't be there [24:25] um a lot of times that dog is anxious [24:28] when you're gone and that anxious [24:30] behavior leads to roaming around and [24:32] getting into stuff if they have a crate [24:34] which is like their little den [24:35] their safe place they don't have to [24:38] worry as much in that crate when you're [24:39] gone they're not thinking about what in [24:41] the world do i need to do with my time [24:42] they're just in their crate probably [24:44] sleeping [24:45] if you have one that's doing this while [24:46] you're at the house you've got to catch [24:48] it so my first you know order of [24:50] business is to watch the dog monitor the [24:52] dog if you're in your house with your [24:54] dog you should know where they're at and [24:55] what they're doing at all times okay and [24:58] this is the hard part to get through [24:59] because that's a lot of monitoring i [25:01] know [25:02] the second they go to do something so [25:04] your timing's big here too you want them [25:06] to know and they can very easily learn [25:07] this just like nate was saying with the [25:09] begging they can learn appropriate [25:11] things to bite and toy with and not [25:13] appropriate things for sure [25:15] so i also make a pretty big impression [25:17] with the stuff i don't want them chewing [25:18] on if i turn around and i'm looking at [25:20] my dog and they start gnawing on my [25:22] kitchen table i have a big no and i go [25:25] over and make sure they stop doing that [25:27] okay whether i just pull them away from [25:29] it [25:30] show them that there's something else [25:31] they can chew on you know give them a [25:32] bone or a toy say here chew on this not [25:34] that but the hard part is catching them [25:37] every time they do that we want them to [25:38] never really touch that furniture [25:40] without us saying hey no don't do that [25:43] go do this okay that's pretty successful [25:46] but you have to catch it that's the hard [25:47] part that people kind of fall away from [25:49] they have every intention of watching [25:51] their dog but then the next thing you [25:53] know they're like i i just looked away [25:54] for one second so dedicate to that [25:57] watching them you know even if you just [25:59] dedicate to it for a week just catching [26:01] them doing this it'll make such a huge [26:03] difference and i do redirect in this [26:05] situation give them their appropriate [26:07] things to chew on next thing you know [26:09] they're hunting those things down [26:10] instead of your furniture [26:12] things like that furniture is really fun [26:14] to chew on for dogs it breaks apart it's [26:16] wood sometimes they pull on it and it [26:18] tears so that's a really fun activity [26:21] and if you don't catch it you're not [26:23] going to be able to stop it [26:25] yeah and just like you said if you don't [26:26] provide them with something else [26:28] to replace that i mean dogs need to chew [26:31] especially puppies they're going through [26:33] that teething period they need something [26:36] to chew and of course if we don't [26:37] provide it for them [26:39] they'll find one on their own and i [26:41] really like how you said the crate as [26:43] well you know often people are asking me [26:45] what do we need a crate for and i always [26:47] say you need it for house training and [26:49] you need it for potty training well what [26:51] is potty training of course we know it's [26:53] the dog not going to the bathroom in the [26:54] house what is house training will the [26:56] dog behaving in the house if you're [26:58] still having to correct the dog for [27:00] chewing on furniture if you're still [27:01] having to correct the dog for going into [27:03] places they're not supposed to be then [27:06] you still need a crate and i always [27:07] recommend too even after the dogs done [27:09] being house trained and potty trained [27:11] keep the crate because dogs as you said [27:13] they like their den they like their safe [27:15] place to go place of comfort [27:18] now i haven't used [27:20] this option [27:23] i've used it maybe a couple times if [27:25] that and i never really had much success [27:27] with it so i'm kind of curious if you've [27:29] used it or if you had clients use it if [27:31] they've had much success but those [27:33] different sprays that are supposed to be [27:35] a deterrent to get the dog not to chew [27:38] yep i've had people use them the most [27:40] success i see is very very small puppies [27:43] i'm very young puppies i've also had the [27:46] opposite happen where the dog likes that [27:48] taste for some reason so everything they [27:50] spray it on the dog wants to lick it off [27:52] and you know chew it off of there so [27:54] i've had that happen too [27:55] it's much more effective to just stop [27:58] the behavior or [27:59] catch them and make sure you tell them [28:01] that we don't want to chew on that we [28:02] want to chew on this yep i couldn't [28:04] agree more that's i mean the way i [28:06] always look at it is [28:08] if it's dangerous or destructive [28:11] the way i like to keep my playbook is [28:13] it's going to be corrected dangerous and [28:15] destructive behaviors i just feel the [28:17] need i'm going to correct it right away [28:19] i don't want to risk the bitter apple [28:22] spray not working you know because of [28:24] course like you said if they end up [28:25] liking it [28:26] now you're now it's even a bigger issue [28:28] so sometimes just setting the dog up to [28:30] fail correcting them in the act [28:33] getting it out of their repertoire and [28:35] giving them of course something better [28:37] to chew on all right i got one more [28:39] question for you i know we're only going [28:41] over the five uh any dog training books [28:44] you might recommend i definitely so it's [28:47] kind of a more um it's like a dog [28:49] trainer's book but i think that clients [28:51] or anyone interested in dogs would be [28:52] really beneficial to read but it's [28:54] called successful together i have to [28:56] look up the um you know it's a european [28:59] book i think so i'd have to look up the [29:00] author again but i think it's a group of [29:02] people kind of that came together to [29:03] write this book um but it's it's got a [29:06] ton of tips and i do like the ivan book [29:08] we've talked about before it's a [29:09] schutzon book [29:11] it's called schutzen i believe by ivan [29:13] balabanov but ivan has a really [29:15] interesting outlook on dog training and [29:17] it comes through in that book he's [29:18] incredible he's a very good dog trainer [29:20] and you've worked directly with him a [29:21] couple times too right i consider him a [29:23] friend he's um he's got a whole [29:25] different outlook viewpoint kind of than [29:27] a lot of people have that i really like [29:29] it's a lot of play-based he definitely [29:31] you know uses corrections when [29:32] appropriate and everything but it's very [29:34] play-based and interaction based and i [29:36] really like that [29:38] any other [29:39] books or any last saved rounds any [29:42] golden nuggets that you can give out to [29:43] anybody who might be struggling or even [29:46] someone who's becoming or wanting to [29:47] become a professional dog trainer [29:50] yeah so if you want to become a [29:51] professional dog trainer you know get [29:53] out there and and train go to a school [29:55] go look up some seminars um i will [29:58] encourage you to to not jump into what [30:00] happened to me kind of in the beginning [30:01] of [30:02] method um method circling like i would [30:05] try one method for one week and then [30:06] jump to another and jump to another [30:07] because i just did a whole bunch of [30:09] education right away [30:11] so you'll confuse yourself and your dog [30:13] that way [30:14] so you know get out there with a bunch [30:16] of different people if you want to [30:17] become a dog trainer [30:18] a lot of trainers are hesitant to take [30:20] in apprentices um that's just a thing in [30:23] the in the industry but a lot of us love [30:25] that as well so go out talk to people [30:28] get training um you know youtube's a [30:30] great place to learn but be careful who [30:32] you're watching [30:33] and uh you know go to the go to the [30:35] tippity top people go to the ivan [30:37] balabanovs look at their stuff you know [30:39] they have a lot of stuff out there i [30:41] know um a lot of shits and trainers have [30:43] websites a lot of people like nate have [30:45] websites that can show you so much on [30:47] the internet um in gold nugget wise [30:51] i would say [30:52] really focus on the dog you have a lot [30:54] of clients i work with [30:56] sort of want their dog to be a different [30:57] dog and if they would just embrace who [31:00] their dog is they would see that that [31:02] dog is actually more than they ever [31:04] could have dreamed of if they just give [31:06] that dog a chance learn that dog and [31:08] kind of check your expectations and work [31:11] together it's a process there's no [31:13] there's no really end to training i'm [31:15] sure nate would say the same thing it's [31:17] like a lifestyle

The history of dog potty pads, also known as training pads or pee pads, dates back to the 1960s when they were first developed as a solution for apartment-dwelling dogs who did not have access to outdoor spaces for relieving themselves. These early versions of training pads were made of absorbent materials and were intended to be used indoors, providing a designated spot for dogs to go potty when they couldn't go outside. Over time, training pads have evolved and become more sophisticated."

They are also used for a variety of purposes beyond potty training, such as helping to keep floors clean for senior dogs who may have difficulty holding their bladder, or for dogs who are indoors for extended periods of time due to inclement weather or their owner's work schedule. Training pads are now a common household item for many dog owners and are widely available at pet stores and online."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 345/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] when it comes to having a pet a few [00:01] things instantly come to mind one of [00:03] which is potty training now most of the [00:06] time we want our dogs to learn to go to [00:07] the bathroom outside but what if due to [00:10] circumstances the dog may need to go [00:12] inside let me give you an example [00:14] recently my parents oldest dog started [00:16] having accidents inside the house simply [00:18] because of her advanced age little roxy [00:20] could no longer hold it when she had to [00:23] go being a dog trainer i wanted to help [00:25] them the best way possible my first [00:27] thought was for them to teach her how to [00:29] go on a potty pad the one problem with [00:32] this was the constant cleanup and the [00:34] smell then i considered a doggy door but [00:37] since i live next to a forest preserve [00:39] the risk of coyotes is too great to [00:41] allow her to come and go outside as she [00:43] pleases i also thought about fake grass [00:45] but again the smell and cleanup still [00:48] became an issue long story short i came [00:50] across an incredible product that [00:52] literally does everything my parents and [00:54] little roxy needs it's called brilliant [00:57] pad it eliminates odors requires minimal [01:00] maintenance we're talking hands off for [01:02] weeks it has superior absorption and [01:05] it's very sanitary [01:06] the first thing that struck me was the [01:08] need to train roxy to use the brilliant [01:10] pad so i put together a training plan [01:12] and i sent my parents a brilliant pad [01:14] unit long story short they loved the [01:16] product and said it was a game changer [01:19] there are many other reasons why someone [01:20] may want to train their dogs to use a [01:22] brilliant pad for example let's say you [01:24] live in a high-rise apartment or maybe [01:26] some of you don't have a yard or you [01:28] work long hours and you don't want your [01:30] dog to have to hold it of course there's [01:32] many other reasons and if you fall into [01:33] this category you've come to the right [01:35] place in today's video i'll teach you [01:37] how to train your dog to use the [01:39] brilliant pad before we begin let's set [01:42] up the brilliant pad it comes neatly [01:44] packaged it's user friendly and very [01:46] easy to assemble the unit comes out in [01:48] one piece including three spray bottles [01:51] go here which is a scent that will [01:52] encourage your dog to go potty tidy shot [01:55] for odor and stain remover and no no [01:58] bitter repellent that discourages [01:59] unwanted chewing during the training [02:02] process i used the go here spray and it [02:04] worked perfectly there's a scannable qr [02:06] code for the step-by-step instructions [02:08] and the unit only takes about two [02:10] minutes to set up [02:12] now that we're done with that let's get [02:14] ready to start training first we want to [02:16] develop our communication channels these [02:18] are known as markers or condition [02:20] reinforcers it's a word or a sound such [02:22] as a clicker and they are most commonly [02:25] called markers because that signifies [02:27] that we are marking a moment in time [02:29] when our dogs are right or wrong now [02:31] some call this step loading the markers [02:33] while other call it engagement training [02:36] in this step your pain rewarding your [02:38] dog for focusing their attention on you [02:40] so during this exercise you're teaching [02:42] your dogs two things you're teaching [02:44] them the communication channels the [02:46] markers and you're teaching them that [02:48] it's a good thing to look at you [02:50] remember the more engagement that we get [02:52] from our dogs the faster they'll learn [02:55] we'll be teaching our dogs two markers [02:56] that signal positive reinforcement the [02:59] first marker predicts and guarantees a [03:01] reward such as a treat i'll be using the [03:03] word yes while the second marker [03:06] guarantees and predicts release and [03:08] reward i'll be using the word free the [03:11] only time we're going to use the first [03:12] marker that's going to be my yes is when [03:14] we're working on the stay in all the [03:16] other situations we'll be using the [03:18] second marker which is the free [03:21] later in the video we'll also teach our [03:22] dogs a marker that predicts negative [03:24] reinforcement which by the way is not a [03:27] correction or a punishment allow me to [03:30] quickly break down this exercise first [03:32] you want to get your dog's attention [03:34] once your dog is looking at you you're [03:36] going to use your first marker it could [03:37] be your voice or a clicker then you're [03:39] going to deliver the reward keep in mind [03:41] and this is very important the marker [03:43] sound must come before you move to [03:45] deliver the reward if you say your [03:47] marker while you're giving your dog the [03:49] reward your dog will never become [03:51] conditioned to the sound [03:53] once your dog eats the treat and looks [03:54] back at you you're going to use your [03:56] second marker followed by moving away [03:58] from your dog encouraging them to come [04:00] to you to get the reward this will help [04:03] teach them to understand the concept of [04:05] release and reward i would recommend [04:07] doing this step twice a day for about [04:09] three days however after that's [04:11] completed in your dog's condition before [04:13] every training session i would recommend [04:15] spending 15 to 30 seconds or so on [04:18] engagement training this will increase [04:19] your dog's motivation which in turn will [04:22] help your dog learn much faster good boy [04:25] very good yes [04:27] excellent that's my little man free [04:30] oh he's a good boy [04:32] who's a good boy [04:34] yes [04:35] very good [04:38] free [04:39] very good way to go bandit [04:42] way to go buddy [04:46] yes [04:48] excellent nice work [04:51] free [04:53] whoop back this way nice [04:57] yes [04:58] very good [05:01] free [05:02] very good [05:05] nice [05:08] yes [05:10] way to go [05:12] free [05:14] very good [05:15] the next step is to teach our dogs the [05:16] concept of luring now some dogs will get [05:19] this concept naturally while others may [05:21] take a little extra effort in either [05:23] case the process will be the same first [05:26] we want to place the food in our hand [05:28] and secure it with our thumb this will [05:29] create a valley that is easy for our [05:31] dogs to place their muzzle into in order [05:34] to get access to the reward but what if [05:36] your dog is biting at your hand to get [05:38] the food if that's the case here's a [05:40] quick little trick the process is simple [05:43] first hold the food in your fist if your [05:45] dog tries biting at the food then the [05:47] hand stays closed once your dog is being [05:50] gentle then slowly start to open your [05:52] hand instantly close it again if he [05:54] starts to bite too hard repeat this [05:56] until your dog knows that they need to [05:58] take the food nicely the idea is basic [06:00] cause and effect and it works [06:02] beautifully now that our dogs know how [06:04] to get the food from our hands we're [06:06] going to ask them to work for it we'll [06:08] start with the easy tasks and will [06:09] gradually make it more challenging start [06:12] by slowly moving your hand away from [06:13] your dog when your dog starts to follow [06:16] it mark with your second marker and then [06:18] release the reward the idea is to teach [06:20] the dog that if they follow our hands [06:22] they'll receive a reward we're going to [06:24] use this to teach multiple behaviors one [06:27] of which will be to go to the brilliant [06:28] pad when you're working on this stage [06:30] don't worry about naming the command [06:32] until you know you can get your dog to [06:34] do the behavior every single time with [06:36] the physical cue just like with our [06:38] marker training the engagement training [06:41] this step is all about our communication [06:43] channels and not about the commands yet [06:45] you want to continue this step up until [06:47] the point where you can lure your dog [06:48] into any desired position most dogs can [06:51] learn this training step within one to [06:53] three days [06:54] very nice [06:56] free [06:57] very good way to go [07:00] way to go my little man [07:02] free nice job bandit [07:09] free [07:10] very good [07:15] free very nice [07:19] free [07:20] good job [07:24] free

[08:22] and right back on the climb [08:24] free good let's see if we can do it down [08:27] on here [08:31] free good boy [08:33] let's go right back down free go ahead [08:35] and let's come back up into the set [08:39] free good job [08:41] dogs have what's known as a classical [08:43] opposition reflex this means when we put [08:45] a leash on our dogs they instinctively [08:47] pull against it with leash pressure [08:49] training we'll show our dogs that if [08:51] they follow the leash instead of [08:52] resisting it good things will happen [08:55] once we have our dogs trained on the [08:56] leash cue many new doors open up in our [08:58] training we can use it to help teach [09:00] commands reinforce expectations create [09:03] invisible boundaries and aid us in [09:05] teaching the stay command first we'll [09:07] apply slight pressure from the leash [09:09] directly in front of the dog after the [09:11] pressure has been applied we'll use our [09:13] food lure to guide our dogs to get them [09:16] to walk forward once our dog walks [09:18] forward in the direction of the leash we [09:20] will release the pressure mark the [09:22] behavior and then deliver the reward [09:24] we'll do this for any behavior we would [09:26] like the dog to perform with the leash [09:28] for example if we want to use the leash [09:30] cue to get our dogs into the down [09:32] position we'll first apply the pressure [09:35] then once the dog feels the pressure [09:37] we'll lure our dogs into the down [09:39] position with a piece of food once the [09:41] dog is in the down position we'll turn [09:43] off the pressure mark and reward just [09:45] like with luring if done correctly most [09:48] dogs can learn this training step within [09:49] one to three days [09:53] free good boy [09:56] free good [10:03] free good [10:11] free nice job [10:19] free good [10:21] free good [10:27] free good boy very good [10:32] free nice [10:41] free good [10:43] did you get

[11:03] this is literally the first time him [11:05] doing leash pressure training and he's [11:07] almost already got it [11:08] one of the pros of having a very smart [11:10] breed [11:12] free very good [11:19] free nice work [11:22] free very good [11:26] you're so smart [11:28] free very nice [11:30] so you can see he's going with the [11:32] pressure and that's what we want [11:35] he needs a

good [12:11] free very nice [12:16] good [12:17] so we use the food to help them figure [12:18] out what we want [12:20] free good job [12:23] oh now you're just figuring out the [12:24] pattern huh free good [12:34] come on free excellent [12:42] free good [12:45] free very good [12:47] oh [12:49] free good job buddy [12:54] free good [12:58] free good now you're saying he's [13:00] resisting less and less free and he's [13:02] following the leash [13:07] free good [13:09] let's do another one of these [13:11] oh [13:12] you need help free [13:14] good boy [13:16] let's get another one in there [13:19] free [13:20] before moving forward i want to mention [13:22] a quick little trick that will help dogs [13:24] become more comfortable with the [13:26] brilliant pad simply by placing the [13:28] brilliant pad in a location that the dog [13:30] normally walks through for example [13:32] placing it at the bottom of the stairs [13:34] or in a doorway by doing this we can [13:36] increase the dog's confidence and reduce [13:39] the possibility of the dog having any [13:41] fear issues in the future now that we've [13:43] developed our communication channels [13:44] we'll start teaching our dogs the verbal [13:46] commands in this next section of the [13:48] video i'll demonstrate how to teach the [13:50] climb command also known as the place [13:52] command the off command and the go potty [13:55] command for this training i like to use [13:58] an elevated climb bed one that's large [14:00] enough to place over the brilliant pad [14:02] this will allow us to gradually [14:04] introduce our dogs to the brilliant pad [14:07] as a part of the training which will [14:08] also help prevent any fear issues we'll [14:11] be using our markers luring and leash [14:14] pressure for this exercise we want to [14:16] teach our dogs how to go to the climb [14:18] bed with both luring as well as leash [14:20] pressure once your dog is confidently [14:23] jumping up on the bed when you present [14:24] the physical cue we'll start to [14:26] introduce the command while doing this [14:28] exercise we'll slowly start to move the [14:30] brilliant pad out from underneath the [14:32] bed or you can slide the bed away from [14:34] the brilliant pad revealing it a little [14:37] bit more during each session we'll also [14:39] use the brilliant pad as a stepping [14:41] platform for the climb bed keep in mind [14:44] if we want the dog to learn the command [14:46] it's essential to make sure that the [14:48] command precedes the physical cue by [14:51] about a half second or so it must be [14:53] predictable to the dog think of it as [14:55] questions and answers the question is [14:57] the command the answer is the physical [15:00] cue so the process becomes command [15:03] motivate mark and reward in that order [15:06] first we say the command the question [15:08] then we present the physical cue that [15:11] would be our luring or leash pressure [15:12] which is the answer once the dog [15:14] completes the behavior you'll mark and [15:16] then you'll reward you'll continue to [15:18] use the physical cue meaning you're [15:20] going to continue to give your dog the [15:21] right answer up until the point where [15:23] the dog gives you the answer before you [15:25] provide it for them now some dogs can [15:27] learn the verbal command within a week [15:29] or so while others may take a month or [15:31] more since we can get our dogs to [15:33] perform every task with a physical cue [15:36] we can move forward with the training [15:38] even if our dog doesn't know the verbal [15:40] command yet off [15:43] free very good [15:46] climb [15:48] free very good you're so smart [15:52] off [15:55] very nice [15:57] climb [15:59] free very good [16:02]

[17:58] off [18:00] free good [18:02] climb [18:04] free very nice now we want to teach our [18:06] dogs to climb stay first start by giving [18:09] your dog the climb command when your dog [18:11] breaks the position you will calmly say [18:13] wrong this is going to be the marker [18:15] that predicts negative reinforcement [18:16] that's our leash pressure then you're [18:18] going to casually walk to the dog grab [18:20] the leash and then use the leash cue to [18:23] place the dog back into the position [18:24] that was just broken once your dog is [18:27] back on the bed you'll praise and pet [18:29] your dog petting is optional but don't [18:31] give your dog a treat right away the [18:33] reason for this is that some dogs will [18:35] break the position on purpose so they [18:37] can get the reward when placed back on [18:39] the stay position i usually like to wait [18:42] around maybe five seconds ten seconds or [18:44] so before i mark and reward by waiting [18:46] those five to ten seconds we're paying [18:48] the dog for duration and not for [18:50] breaking the position you must say wrong [18:52] or whichever word you choose within the [18:54] first second that your dog breaks the [18:56] position and you only say wrong once for [18:59] each offense even if it takes you a few [19:01] minutes to get your dog back to the [19:03] position that they just broke and you're [19:05] going to continue to do this step up [19:06] until the point where your dog either [19:08] stops moving or goes back into the [19:10] position that they just broke on their [19:12] own after you say wrong this will prove [19:14] to us that the dog knows what's expected [19:17] and your dog knows how to turn off [19:18] pressure by complying [19:20] climb [19:22] yes [19:23] so now this time i said yes so now he [19:24] has to stay there [19:26] yes [19:27] i'm gonna let him know he's doing a good [19:29] job by paying him yes [19:31] very good building distance [19:34] yes if he breaks i'm gonna say wrong and [19:36] i'm gonna bring them right back to the [19:37] bed wrong [19:39] calmly grab the leash [19:41] calmly guide them back good boy [19:44] fix that leash you got it on your head [19:46] nice work [19:48] yes and i don't spend too much time on [19:51] stays meaning when i'm working a stay [19:53] session yes you don't want to spend too [19:55] long on it because puppies have short [19:57] attention spans as they get better yes [19:59] we can increase the duration of the stay [20:04] yes [20:05] very nice [20:07] oh you made a mistake so i'm not gonna [20:09] say wrong for that [20:11] wrong but i will say wrong for that one [20:13] come on come on good [20:16] wrong [20:17] verbal praise when i put them back on [20:21] good boy but not a reward right away [20:24] yes [20:25] excellent [20:29] yes very good oh i'll count that as a [20:32] mistake too you look like you fell [20:34] watch the edge [20:36] yes [20:37] good [20:40] wrong [20:41] so now we say wrong we grab the leash [20:43] and use that leash pressure [20:46] wrong and this is normal all your dogs [20:48] are going to do this they're going to [20:49] jump off the first few times [20:51] if they resist we just keep the pressure [20:52] it's very light too you shouldn't have [20:54] to pull very hard [20:57] yes i made some noise so he'd look at [21:00] me wrong [21:05] good [21:08] yes [21:13] wrong [21:14] also notice how i say the markers [21:18] and the commands always with the same [21:20] tone same rise and inflection on my [21:21] voice [21:23] yes [21:24] try to avoid using a deep voice when [21:26] you're training your dogs don't do this [21:28] yes sounds like a growl we want to have [21:31] it nice high pitch happy sounds [21:36] yes [21:37] we're going to build a little bit more [21:38] distance and this is this dog's very [21:40] first time yes [21:42] wrong wrong can override a yes this is [21:44] his very first time doing a stay [21:47] so he's resisting so i got light [21:49] pressure very light not hard have you [21:50] done the leash pressure training [21:51] correctly he'll know to jump back up on [21:53] the climb [21:55] make him hold it for a second yes [21:57] then we come back and we reward [22:01] yes excellent notice i say yes too [22:04] before i start walking back towards him [22:07] it's separated i say yes [22:09] then i walk towards him [22:11] another common mistake people do is [22:13] they'll go [22:15] yes that's not a marker [22:18] get your butt up there buddy [22:21] we're marking a moment [22:22] yes [22:23] then we're walking back and delivering [22:25] the reward think of it like changing [22:26] lanes [22:27] you signal first then you do the change [22:30] yes [22:31] very good so this was a good stay [22:33] session [22:34] and now we're going to release them when [22:35] we first release our dogs from a stay [22:37] when we're working on a stay we want to [22:39] release them when we're close enough to [22:40] touch them this is for habit [22:43] if we release them from a distance [22:44] they'll anticipate that so when we first [22:46] start teaching to stay for the first two [22:48] weeks minimum don't release your pup [22:50] unless you can touch them [22:52] free and i'm going to use the terminal [22:54] marker and give them a reward and some [22:56] praise good boy quick side note when [22:58] teaching stay we do not say stay the [23:01] stay is implied when you put your dog [23:03] onto a commanded position however some [23:05] people feel more comfortable saying the [23:07] word stay if that's the case with you [23:09] feel free to use the word as it won't [23:11] negatively impact the training when we [23:13] place a dog into the state command we [23:15] have three ways of releasing them from [23:17] that stay one we can use a release word [23:19] for my dogs that word is break that's [23:21] very easy to teach you say the word and [23:23] then you get really excited and you [23:25] squat down encouraging your dog to come [23:27] to you we can use our second marker [23:29] which predicts release and reward for my [23:31] dogs that word is free lastly we can [23:33] give our dogs a new command such as come [23:36] or heal [23:37] most dogs will start to understand the [23:39] stay command within a few days but it [23:41] can take several weeks or more to get [23:43] the stay to become completely reliable [23:45] just be patient and continue to work [23:47] with your dog or puppy each day climb [23:51] yes [23:57] yes [24:03] wrong [24:06] come on good good [24:09] wrong [24:11] good that's what i like [24:13] yes [24:17] yes [24:23] yes [24:28] wrong [24:32] good boy [24:35] yes [24:40] yes [24:42] very good wrong [24:43] good [24:45] wrong [24:48] good [24:52] yes [24:57] yes [24:58] very nice buddy [25:00] very good [25:03] yes [25:09] free [25:11] good job now we're going to introduce [25:12] our dogs to the go potty command the [25:14] nice thing about dogs is that they are [25:16] great at pattern recognition which we'll [25:18] use to help us with the training process [25:21] in the morning when you know your dog [25:22] has to go to the bathroom take your dog [25:25] to the location that they usually go and [25:27] tell them to go potty the only [25:29] difference is that the brilliant pad [25:31] will be placed in your dog's favorite [25:33] potty location if your dog already goes [25:35] on a potty pad be sure to place the [25:37] potty pad on the brilliant pad then over [25:40] time fold it in half then fold it again [25:43] and finally remove it so your dog is [25:45] only using the brilliant pad if your dog [25:47] currently goes potty outside place the [25:50] pad in your dog's favorite potty [25:51] location outside and if your dog is [25:54] comfortable being held i would suggest [25:56] carrying your dog to the brilliant pad [25:59] then say go potty followed by placing [26:02] your dog on the pad if your dog would [26:04] prefer to walk on a leash then walk your [26:06] dog to the location say go potty then [26:09] use one of the physical cues that we've [26:11] established earlier to direct your dog [26:13] onto the brilliant pad most dogs will go [26:16] potty right away since they have to go [26:18] if they don't simply keep them on the [26:20] platform using the stay training until [26:22] the dog goes potty once the dog goes [26:24] potty praise and reward them then do [26:27] something that the dog enjoys this will [26:29] show the dog that the faster they go [26:31] potty the faster they get to do [26:32] something enjoyable it could be [26:34] something like a walk a few minutes of [26:36] training tug play or just letting them [26:39] snip the yard as long as they enjoy the [26:41] activity [26:42] the one exception is going to be for [26:44] puppies that are still being crate [26:46] trained and are going potty in the [26:48] middle of the night so if you have to [26:49] get up at night to take your puppy out [26:51] to go potty instead of allowing them to [26:53] play afterwards simply give them a treat [26:56] or maybe let them sniff around for a bit [26:58] i would advise against playing with the [27:00] puppy in the middle of the night because [27:02] it could make it harder for them to fall [27:03] back to sleep however during the day [27:06] you're gonna follow the same process as [27:08] everyone else [27:09] if your dog or puppy happens to make a [27:11] mistake calmly say wrong and then use [27:14] the leash cue to guide them on the [27:15] brilliant pad as mentioned earlier this [27:18] will teach the dog to stop what they're [27:19] doing which in this case is relieving [27:22] themselves in the wrong spot and by [27:24] taking them to the brilliant pad it's [27:26] giving them the correct answer in a [27:28] sense we're saying don't do this but do [27:31] this instead in addition you have to say [27:34] wrong while the dog is in the act if you [27:37] see the mess but you didn't see your dog [27:39] make the mess then your only option is [27:42] to clean it up if you're starting with [27:43] the brilliant pad outside each potty [27:46] break move it closer and closer to the [27:48] final desired location in addition be [27:51] sure to bring it inside after each use [27:54] to avoid any possible weather damage [27:56] continue to help your dog each day until [27:59] your dog starts to use the brilliant pad [28:02] on their own [28:03] a simple trick to help speed up the [28:05] training process is to use a puppy play [28:07] pen and this goes for the older dogs as [28:09] well since dogs don't like to relieve [28:11] themselves where they eat or where they [28:13] sleep this process uses those instincts [28:16] to effectively and quickly teach our [28:18] dogs to use the brilliant pad when [28:20] setting up the play pen we're going to [28:22] break it down into three sections a [28:24] section where they sleep a section where [28:26] they eat and a section where they're [28:28] going to go to the bathroom the first [28:30] section will be the dog's bed or perhaps [28:32] a crate with a bed inside of it the [28:35] second section will be where you're [28:36] going to feed your dog if you're still [28:38] training and using meal time for [28:40] training as i do just be sure to give [28:42] them a little bit of food in that [28:44] location the last section is going to [28:46] have the brilliant pad [28:48] one final note if your dog seems to be [28:50] going back in training then simply go [28:52] back a step or two in the training [28:54] process revisiting the early steps will [28:57] often help our dogs get right back on [28:59] track if you follow this step-by-step [29:02] process you'll be able to quickly and [29:04] effectively teach your dog or puppy to [29:06] use the brilliant pad and if you would [29:08] like a brilliant pad

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 348/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] maureen cuccinello's journey as a dog [00:02] trainer started at the young age of 16 [00:05] when she brought home her very first [00:06] german shepherd puppy eager to raise her [00:09] new puppy properly she began to research [00:11] how to train and effectively communicate [00:13] with dogs training her personal dog [00:16] sparked a passion for which she ended up [00:18] turning into a career where she began [00:20] with helping local pet owners manage and [00:22] communicate with their dogs in 2014 [00:25] maureen attended the tom rose school [00:27] graduating at the top of her class from [00:30] there she trained dogs at multiple [00:32] kennels all over the eastern united [00:34] states she has trained and imprinted [00:37] multiple dogs in the areas of [00:38] competition obedience service therapy [00:41] tracking agility scent discrimination [00:44] and protection she has also helped [00:47] countless pet owners teach their dogs [00:49] manners and obedience in addition she [00:52] has also rehabilitated numerous [00:54] aggressive fearful and reactive dogs [00:57] some of which were extreme cases [00:59] she currently competes with her three [01:01] german shepherds in sports such as akc [01:04] obedience and igp [01:06] please welcome maureen cuccinello [01:09] thanks again for being on the show i [01:10] really appreciate it today we are going [01:12] to be talking about the most common [01:14] mistakes made by new dog owners but [01:18] before getting started can you tell us a [01:19] little bit about yourself what got you [01:21] into dog training and what has taken you [01:23] from where you were when you started to [01:25] where you are now yeah absolutely so hey [01:28] i'm maureen cuccinella um i've been [01:30] training dogs for 11 years now so i [01:32] first started out with my my dog celia [01:36] who i still actually have she's 11 year [01:38] olds old now she's over here hanging out [01:40] um but i started off with her she was my [01:42] first dog ever okay so getting into um [01:46] having my first puppy ever let alone my [01:48] first dog ever was let me tell you quite [01:50] the journey [01:51] so um when i first got here i was [01:54] starting to do research i was watching a [01:55] lot of videos i was watching like um [01:58] researching on the internet [01:59] and i um i realized how confusing [02:04] like trying to find dog training [02:05] information can be but i found a lot of [02:07] great resources where i could train [02:09] myself to train my dog which i thought [02:11] was super helpful [02:13] however [02:14] a lot of that they um they would say oh [02:16] only do this right only use positive [02:18] training don't use this or that or prong [02:21] collars eat collars whatever so [02:24] when she got around six months old [02:26] and she started developing those german [02:28] shepherd reactive behaviors we see very [02:30] common in the breed i had a great [02:33] foundation of engagement of what sit is [02:36] down in his is and everything but i [02:38] had a hard time stopping her in that [02:41] moment or keeping her under threshold [02:44] especially when the world can be so [02:45] random and at that time i was just a 16 [02:49] year old girl with my new dog i couldn't [02:51] drive or anything yet so i didn't have [02:54] the ability to um really set up that [02:56] like lab kind of situation or classroom [02:59] situation where i could really simulate [03:01] stuff so i realized how challenging it [03:03] was for a lot of owners so this started [03:05] my dog training journey i also fell in [03:07] love with uh training her trick she [03:08] learned over 100 dog tricks i still do [03:11] them with her here and there she can't [03:12] do things like sit pretty or stand on [03:14] her rear legs anymore but we still have [03:16] fun uh but yeah that's that's where i [03:18] started then i went to um so oh before i [03:21] went to school i um i helped out the [03:22] local shelter i worked with people um [03:26] like uh some local trainers um and [03:30] researched on my own and practiced on [03:32] local dogs like my neighbor's dogs then [03:35] i went to school then i went to [03:37] all over the place i was all over the [03:38] place and now i have my own business [03:40] here in north georgia called spirited k9 [03:43] and how long have you been running your [03:44] own business now um so i've been running [03:47] it for about two years almost two years [03:49] so it'll be two years in uh september [03:51] 2020 so technically a year and a half [03:54] that's excellent and i like what you [03:56] said about going and working at a local [03:58] shelter that's something that i [03:59] recommend to people on a regular basis [04:02] that are interested in becoming a dog [04:03] trainer but they may not have the [04:05] resources to go to a school like the tom [04:08] rose school or michael ellis or kennel [04:11] wood or one of those other schools but i [04:13] noticed when you came down to the school [04:15] because we were there at the same time [04:17] you were hands down one of the best [04:19] students right from the start so the [04:21] amount of research and the amount of [04:23] practice and training that you had put [04:25] in at the very beginning and of course [04:28] your passion for dogs and dog training [04:31] it really [04:32] made you stand out amongst the other [04:34] students and of course you were one of [04:36] the top students of your class and it [04:38] doesn't surprise me that you're doing [04:40] such great things now i love the trick [04:42] stuff as well i want to incorporate more [04:44] of that on my channel so maybe sometime [04:46] in the future you could do a couple [04:48] videos for my channel i think my [04:49] audience would really like that [04:51] so [04:52] with all that being said and i'm sure [04:55] just like myself you made a bunch of [04:57] mistakes on your journey of becoming a [04:59] dog trainer and not everybody [05:02] is [05:03] trying to be a dog trainer but when [05:05] somebody has a dog they're essentially a [05:07] dog trainer they're just not a [05:09] professional dog trainer [05:11] what are some of the most common [05:13] mistakes that you see with new dog [05:15] owners and what could they do to help [05:17] reduce the consequences of these [05:20] mistakes if they've already made them [05:21] and what they can do to avoid the [05:23] mistakes as well so let's talk about the [05:25] very very first mistake they make the [05:28] very first mistake is selecting the [05:31] wrong dog or the wrong dog breed for [05:34] their lifestyle i get a lot of people [05:36] that come in with high energy breeze i'm [05:39] seeing a lot of australian shepherds [05:41] lately mini aussies german shepherds [05:45] doodles mixed with some really high [05:47] energy dogs and a lot of these clients [05:50] are [05:51] unable to provide what that dog actually [05:53] needs like even though like for example [05:55] a mini aussie you know it's a miniature [05:57] version of an aussie that doesn't mean [05:59] it's going to be a sweet little lap dog [06:01] it's a miniature [06:02] aussie so you get that high energy [06:05] you get that hurting instinct you get [06:07] that need to interact with the owner on [06:10] a regular basis and a lot of the owners [06:12] find themselves overwhelmed because they [06:14] didn't realize that this is the dog they [06:16] were getting they failed to do the [06:18] proper research or we even see um [06:21] those that get german shepherds and [06:23] you're familiar there's all sorts of [06:24] different bloodlines with german [06:26] shepherds and i see a lot these days [06:28] where people like oh no you should you [06:29] need to get a working wine shepherd [06:31] and these people that don't have a lot [06:33] of experience with germ shepherds let [06:35] alone herding breeds listen to that and [06:37] they get themselves a working [06:39] lying german shepherd and don't realize [06:41] how defensive they can be and how drive [06:43] they can be and now they're trying to um [06:46] and this is usually when the dogs are [06:48] the older when they come to me and the [06:50] dogs learned a lot of bad mistakes [06:52] already ver and has the wrong and they [06:55] have the wrong breed for their lifestyle [06:57] and the long the wrong [06:59] wrong bloodline for their lifestyle as [07:01] well so i would say that is the number [07:03] one problem it starts that very first [07:06] decision with getting a dog [07:08] unfortunately they tend to choose the [07:09] wrong breed and the wrong one for their [07:11] lifestyle usually based on looks or [07:14] based on what they've seen on tv [07:15] unfortunately that's a really good point [07:18] too and people often do that as well if [07:20] they're going to a local rescue or local [07:22] shelter they see this cute dog they want [07:25] to rescue the dog they want to bring it [07:27] home and of course giving a dog a home [07:29] is very important but what is more [07:32] important is picking the right dog for [07:34] your lifestyle i also like what you [07:36] pointed out with the german shepherd too [07:38] the german shepherd even though it's one [07:40] breed i mean if you're getting a working [07:42] line german shepherd in comparison to a [07:45] german shepherd that comes from a line [07:47] that's bred more for pet purposes [07:50] they're going to be two completely [07:52] different animals and that's something [07:54] important to note now if somebody has [07:57] already [07:59] have their dog and they have the wrong [08:01] one as far as the breed or the energy [08:03] type but they're committed they want to [08:05] continue to work with that dog let's say [08:07] somebody has that high drive dog that [08:09] they weren't ready for what could they [08:10] do to help work with that dog to still [08:13] give that dog the best life possible yes [08:16] and i've i have a lot of clients like [08:18] that they get this dog they fall in love [08:19] with the dog there's a lot of problems [08:21] but they're committed they want to keep [08:23] this dog and i'm 100 willing to work [08:25] with that uh biggest thing is i feel [08:27] like that the dog's biological needs and [08:29] instincts they need to be fulfilled [08:31] somehow whether that's through [08:33] channeling those through like a game [08:34] like i'm big with frisbee i love [08:36] teaching dogs how to play frisbee i [08:38] think it's a great game for engagement [08:40] and it helps give the dog that [08:42] alleviation to run chase and grab [08:44] something um so i like to teach some [08:46] kind of fun game for the dog to [08:49] alleviate that natural drive along with [08:51] teaching obedience and clear boundaries [08:53] like with our working line shepherds for [08:55] example they're they're coming up a lot [08:57] i'm a big german shepherd person as you [08:59] know um those dogs they need like a [09:02] black and white communication but a good [09:03] relationship you know not hey i am above [09:06] you i'm dominating you no it's like hey [09:07] we're about this is about teamwork right [09:10] we're a team and you get what you would [09:11] like or what you need as a dog through [09:14] listening to me and through our teamwork [09:16] and through our relationship rather than [09:18] trying to fight with that right so again [09:20] uh relieving that biological need along [09:23] with doing some obedience to help [09:24] communicate with the dog and show clear [09:27] black and white this is what we want you [09:28] to do this is not what we want you to do [09:30] along with management right it's not [09:31] just about training a lot of times [09:33] people think training is the one and [09:35] only answer but there's also managing [09:37] right preventing unwanted behaviors [09:39] making sure the dog's not going to be in [09:41] a situation where they can make a [09:42] mistake if you're not ready to approach [09:44] it with training if that makes sense oh [09:47] yeah absolutely training is incredibly [09:48] important often when somebody has a high [09:51] energy dog they think that i just need [09:52] to exercise the dog more which of course [09:55] exercise is very important i mean i do [09:58] believe [09:59] yes absolutely i do believe in the [10:01] concept of the way we can have the most [10:03] well-balanced dog is through [10:05] daily physical mental stimulation as [10:08] well as providing that affection now [10:10] talking about being on the same team [10:13] what is one of the big problems that [10:15] people run into when they think they [10:17] have to be the dominant now of course we [10:20] want to be the leader and a real leader [10:23] is somebody who of course leads by [10:25] example but when it comes to our dogs [10:27] it's we're giving them a clear path [10:29] that's going to ensure their success [10:32] within this life [10:33] and by doing that and training them [10:35] correctly we're a leader but not [10:37] necessarily being the dominant as which [10:40] a lot of people think that they need [10:42] need to be they think they need to yell [10:43] the dog they think they need to show the [10:45] dog how big and powerful they are [10:48] how can having some of these different [10:50] mindsets have a negative impact on the [10:53] training if somebody is acting out as [10:55] the dominant [10:56] oh yes i love this i love this question [10:58] because this i i see all the time um [11:01] whereas where clients you know they [11:02] watch things on tv or they read things [11:05] or maybe they saw family members do [11:07] things when they were younger and [11:08] unfortunately as i'm sure you know the [11:11] whole dominance thing has just been [11:12] blown out of proportion so it's more [11:15] about so with the teamwork stuff it's [11:17] like okay you get what you want through [11:19] working with me versus if it's like hey [11:21] you're not listening to me i'm above you [11:23] we tend to see owners get physical or [11:26] emotional with the dog and then the dog [11:28] is confused because they haven't been [11:30] shown typically what they we want of [11:32] them first and instead we get frustrated [11:35] with them we do an alpha roll and with [11:36] some dogs like our shepherds and big [11:39] strong dogs that you know are going to [11:42] make a lot of mistakes [11:44] that is the worst thing you can do you [11:46] will destroy a relationship you will get [11:47] bit [11:48] you and then that that poor dog is the [11:51] one that suffers you know what i mean [11:53] and then you're more nervous breeze or [11:54] your more sensitive ones they're going [11:56] to be scared of you [11:58] we move towards that dog quickly that [12:00] dog's running away [12:02] right we don't want our dogs to run away [12:03] from us we want them to understand what [12:06] they're supposed to do and it's not all [12:08] just oh okay you didn't do it oh well [12:10] it's we introduce those corrections with [12:12] training callers in the future at the [12:15] after the dog knows what we want of them [12:17] so that way there's clarity versus [12:19] oh no there's my owner he's upset with [12:22] me [12:23] i don't want my owner to come after me [12:26] so i'm i'm going to bite you know [12:27] because i'm scared [12:29] right because there's a lot of confusion [12:30] a lot of conflict in the relationship [12:33] and now what if somebody is working with [12:34] their dogs and they start to realize [12:36] that their dog seems a little anxious [12:38] about the training and often you know [12:41] maybe they've progressed too quickly [12:44] maybe they're trying to ask for [12:46] advanced commands in an environment with [12:48] too many distractions too early on in [12:51] the dog's training if somebody is [12:52] starting to notice issues like this what [12:54] could they do to help guide the dog [12:56] correctly to ensure the success that [12:58] they want [13:00] so i would if i'm already in that [13:02] situation where i put my dog in a [13:04] situation where they're a lot around a [13:05] lot of distractions [13:07] i might just get one little bit of [13:10] progress realize my mistake of putting [13:12] that dog in that situation and load them [13:15] up yeah here you go [13:17] this happens once in a while with our [13:19] board and train dogs okay so we do a lot [13:20] of board and train here unfortunately [13:22] once in a while we're like oh let's take [13:24] the dogs downtown dog is downtown [13:26] unfortunately we jump the gun the dog is [13:28] too distracted so we're like okay we're [13:30] gonna get some success with oh hey you [13:32] just looked at me and you sat i am [13:34] taking that we're gonna load up we're [13:35] gonna go home and we're gonna go back [13:37] and work on some foundational skills in [13:39] the training center but yeah it's it's [13:41] important to realize those mistakes and [13:43] be self-aware about them rather than [13:44] just getting frustrated and continuing [13:46] to work through them that [13:48] talking about common mistakes that [13:49] dogoners make but also dog trainers make [13:52] too is right there um and it's one that [13:54] it happens it happens here and there and [13:56] the best you can do is okay got some [13:58] effort made a little tiny bit of [14:00] progress it's not exactly what i want [14:03] yet but it's getting there and let's [14:06] just go home and then we'll take a break [14:08] and we'll work on the basics [14:11] that's a perfect thing to note too i [14:12] like that you said you want to have one [14:15] win even if it's tiny even if it's like [14:17] okay i can't even get the dog to sit but [14:19] maybe i get the dog to look at me for a [14:21] split second yes i'm gonna reward that [14:23] now let's get out of here so you're [14:25] always ending on a win which is [14:27] incredibly important if people [14:30] understand that so one of the mistakes i [14:32] made when i first started training dogs [14:34] was over training i would train the dog [14:37] so long that the dog would shut down and [14:41] the dog wouldn't be interested in coming [14:43] back to training the next day [14:46] how could somebody identify maybe [14:48] certain behavioral changes in their dog [14:51] that could let them know maybe they're [14:53] asking too much too soon or that they've [14:55] been training too long because they [14:58] really want to get the dog to do the [14:59] down in that session which of course [15:02] when we're working with our dogs we [15:03] shouldn't have a specific goal for the [15:06] one session because that's when we could [15:07] set ourselves up for failure but instead [15:10] working with our dogs and having a good [15:12] time but so going back to the question [15:14] being able to identify it and then [15:16] knowing what to do when they do see it [15:18] yes i am [15:20] you said that was a big problem for you [15:21] i'm guilty of that as well in my [15:23] beginning mostly because when i started [15:25] out i had my one dog and i was obsessed [15:27] with dog training [15:28] i did it um at trs too i would over [15:31] train because i was excited or trying to [15:33] meet gold now i've become a lot i've [15:35] become a lot better about it with okay [15:37] i'm just going to do a quick fun thing [15:38] with my dog really quick and and make [15:41] sure that they like really had a good [15:43] time but anyway in that moment [15:45] um because it does happen once in a [15:47] while especially with my board and train [15:48] dogs right these are these are all new [15:50] dogs that we learn and they're all very [15:52] different you gotta figure out what [15:54] their threshold in training is exactly [15:56] um one big thing is not wanting to eat [15:59] um the dog not wanting to eat or engage [16:01] in play or engage with you maybe some [16:04] avoidance maybe um the dog being too [16:06] distracted maybe the dog [16:08] um when you tell them to sit they just [16:09] want to lay down and just chill [16:12] typically those kind of behaviors i'm [16:14] like all right the training session has [16:16] gone too long this should have ended a [16:18] while back yeah and those are good early [16:21] signs too i mean if you keep pushing it [16:23] they might start licking their lips they [16:25] might start doing some other behaviors [16:27] that really indicate that the dog has [16:30] gone into a high level of stress which [16:32] of course we don't want because we [16:34] always want training to be fun exactly [16:36] and [16:37] again something we we dog trainers catch [16:39] ourselves doing whether it's the time [16:41] limit with our board and train dogs we [16:42] know we got two three four weeks with [16:43] these dogs and we were working on [16:45] behavior getting some success but [16:48] i realized the most um the most success [16:51] happens in the beginning of this [16:52] training session and at the end of the [16:54] training session if that middle part is [16:57] too long [16:58] and with our dogs with how short of an [17:00] attention span they have if it's so long [17:03] all this in the middle it just kind of [17:04] turns into mush and the dog's like this [17:07] is how the session started this is how [17:08] the session ended so if i can make that [17:10] shorter and make the beginning really [17:12] memorable and make the end really [17:14] memorable and just have a nice short [17:16] good session i find i make progress a [17:19] lot faster that way than doing a [17:22] 15 minute 30 minute long drill sometimes [17:25] i'll just pull dog out for five minutes [17:26] all right let's do some leave it's all [17:28] right let's do some downs let's do some [17:29] plays have a good time put them up you [17:32] would be amazed at what happens the next [17:34] day [17:35] it's amazing i might have been [17:37] struggling with something for just a [17:39] moment ended on a great note and that [17:41] dog's like i remembered at the end this [17:42] happened [17:44] so i'm gonna i'm gonna start off with [17:45] this and i'm like oh wow but having just [17:47] you know [17:48] five minutes sometimes five minutes [17:50] right and i i noticed that a lot of dog [17:52] owners struggle with that when they [17:53] think of training they're like oh gosh i [17:54] gotta take my dog out that i gotta do [17:56] this awful 30 minutes or hour long drill [17:59] no no no no [18:01] just aim for five [18:02] frequently throughout the day five five [18:05] minute training sessions that's a a [18:07] really good goal as well i mean five [18:09] minutes most people could do even before [18:12] going to work in the morning if they [18:13] have a day job that they're going to [18:15] wake up five minutes earlier do a quick [18:17] little session with your dog make sure [18:19] it's fun and engaging which something [18:21] you else you said made me think of [18:23] another question for you [18:25] what do you say to owners that come to [18:27] you and they say i want my dog to just [18:30] listen to me because they're supposed to [18:32] listen to me i don't want to have to [18:33] give them treats and toys and all those [18:36] things i want them to just listen to me [18:38] yeah so in those situations i try to [18:41] empathize with with um with a dog and [18:44] saying that okay imagine that you went [18:46] to work and at the end of the week you [18:48] didn't get a paycheck [18:50] would you come back to work that next [18:52] week or would you have that same [18:54] attitude [18:55] every one of my clients say [18:57] no i wouldn't [18:59] i wouldn't want to go back to work i [19:00] wouldn't have the same working attitude [19:02] you'd probably work less you probably [19:04] wouldn't want to work at all because you [19:06] aren't getting anything positive out of [19:08] that relationship you'd be like no screw [19:09] this i want to work somewhere else [19:11] right with our dogs we have to show them [19:15] that means of if if you do this because [19:18] something good comes out of you and in [19:19] the beginning [19:20] in the beginning it might be a lot of [19:22] rewards it might be more than the owner [19:25] wants to do at first but we have to [19:27] establish that initial working [19:28] relationship and then we can make it so [19:31] the dog is rewarded um not as frequently [19:34] like with my dogs i don't need to have [19:36] rewards on me all the time but i don't [19:38] just flat out not reward them anymore [19:41] once in a while they get a huge jackpot [19:43] right hey you came inside like right [19:45] away here you go here's um a really [19:47] yummy snack [19:48] right it's one of those things like it's [19:50] not about [19:51] having a fuzzy cute slave [19:54] right this is a member of your family it [19:57] is a a team [20:00] right it's a team relationship and if [20:02] you have that i am above you [20:04] relationship you're already starting out [20:06] on the wrong foot and you're already [20:07] asking for failure because these these [20:09] guys didn't ask to live in your home [20:12] these guys didn't ask to be a pet dog we [20:14] chose that for them [20:16] yeah definitely well said and so what if [20:19] somebody says well my dog's not even [20:20] food motivated so how am i supposed to [20:23] use food to get my dog to do what i want [20:26] usually with these clients they are [20:27] they're big and free-feeding [20:30] they're big with okay let's feel that [20:32] bull all the way up to the rim [20:34] and you can grab that food whenever you [20:37] want so i like to look at that as oh hey [20:39] that's the bank [20:41] and the bank has a million dollars in it [20:43] so you're not that dog's not going to [20:45] want to go to work right if they're [20:47] always having access to a million [20:49] dollars so this is where that concept [20:51] and i'm sure you've heard of is nothing [20:53] in life is free comes in and i am big on [20:56] these dogs that are picky eaters where [20:58] okay we're going to remove that [21:01] situation of the bowl on the ground [21:02] where they have access to that one [21:04] million dollars constantly and we're [21:06] going to make them poor we're going to [21:09] make it so they want to work for food [21:11] and with these dogs we typically see [21:13] them not want to [21:15] want to work for the food at all in the [21:16] beginning and they need to go a day or [21:18] maybe even two days without having food [21:21] and that's you know we offer the dog the [21:23] food they're like no i don't want it [21:24] because i i don't see this as valuable i [21:26] get it whenever i want i don't need to [21:28] work for this but then after a little [21:30] bit [21:31] the dog starts to be like all right [21:32] there i'm hungry i'm ready to work and i [21:35] might just work on something super [21:37] simple like engagement on a leash right [21:40] indoors and just have mine at least hey [21:41] you look at me yes [21:43] right or um or just a simple place [21:45] command all right let me just learn here [21:47] oh you gave me a little bit effort [21:48] trying to get out of the place yes hey [21:51] right but [21:52] the biggest thing is those dogs are [21:54] typically spoiled and we've trained them [21:57] to not want to work for food we've [21:59] trained them to not be food motivated um [22:02] instead of being like okay you do this [22:04] right you sit then i'll pay you you sit [22:07] then you get to go outside you sit then [22:09] i'll give you some ovens and then as [22:11] time goes on we don't have to think [22:12] about it as much anymore as the dog's [22:14] behavior has become habits so then i can [22:15] maybe have normal feeding times again in [22:17] the future right i see this the most [22:19] with yorkies anytime i get a yorkie and [22:21] i'm like oh boy [22:22] i know you're overfed and spoiled let's [22:24] work on this [22:26] another big issue with the little dogs [22:28] is the potty training issue what i [22:30] always tell people too it's like one of [22:32] the downsides of having a really big [22:35] home the bigger the home the harder it [22:37] is to potty train since the dog may [22:40] think well i can go upstairs and go to [22:42] the bathroom we hang out down here most [22:44] of the time but that's just something [22:46] i'm kind of adding into the discussion [22:48] something else i was thinking about as [22:50] you were talking if somebody does have [22:52] issues where their dog not is they're [22:55] really not food motivated i love the [22:57] analogy about let's go ahead and make [22:59] them poor so now they're going to want [23:02] to work for it but something else you [23:03] said that is really excellent that [23:05] everybody should be practicing is having [23:08] their dog do certain behaviors to get [23:10] certain things like opening the door or [23:13] getting their food as simple as laying [23:15] down if they are currently feeding out [23:17] of a bowl these little things that we [23:19] ask the dogs to do every time as you [23:21] said dogs are creatures of habit so [23:24] eventually the dog's just going to do [23:26] these behaviors because they know that's [23:28] what's expected of them and they're [23:30] going to become in a sense non-verbal [23:33] commands i mean when i first learned the [23:35] automatic sit when halted [23:38] i was just taught to use the leash to [23:40] correct the dog into the sit when we [23:41] stop now of course that could teach the [23:44] dog the behavior but it could teach the [23:46] dog the behavior too if every time you [23:48] stop you tell the dog to sit then the [23:51] dog goes every time we stop you tell me [23:54] to sit so i'm just going to sit you [23:56] don't have to tell me i figured out the [23:58] pattern so pattern training can be good [24:01] but it can also be bad so what are some [24:04] ways that people pattern train their [24:06] dogs that can cause issues and what are [24:08] some ways that they patter train them as [24:09] you said where it could benefit the [24:11] dog's lifestyle as well as the [24:13] relationship yeah absolutely i think [24:15] that's a great question so [24:17] the biggest thing i see is [24:19] oftentimes when we practice like our sit [24:21] and down stays with my clients i'll do [24:24] it sit they walk away and every time [24:26] they move away from the dog [24:28] they call the dog to them [24:30] okay so the dog starts to learn when you [24:32] walk away or you're this distance [24:35] however long that is 10 feet 15 feet [24:37] whatever when you're this distance away [24:39] from me that's when i come to you okay [24:42] so they're going to jump the gun because [24:43] they're used to that pattern so a lot of [24:45] clients will be like oh no he won't stay [24:47] in a sit or down he just keeps getting [24:49] up and it's often because of that [24:51] pattern training okay now stuff that we [24:53] do throughout everyday life where it can [24:55] really benefit us so um for for my dogs [24:58] i have a climb you know what a climb is [25:00] that ray's platform i have one of those [25:02] next to my door [25:04] my cattle dog my newest dog i got her [25:06] almost a year ago she's been a blast [25:08] she's my newest trick dog i can't go out [25:10] and out about her [25:11] but my cattle dog um amps all the dogs [25:15] up with her energy because she's a very [25:17] high energy dog and she would try to [25:19] jump on the door and all the dogs get [25:20] amped up it was this big horny so [25:23] one form of pattern training i taught [25:24] her is any time we're going to go [25:26] outside you got to go on that that climb [25:28] you go on the climb that way you go [25:31] there i open the door and i release you [25:33] and then you can go out so she's learned [25:35] that pattern so she's become proactive [25:37] in that pattern of hey now i want to go [25:39] outside so i'm going to hop on the climb [25:41] and i'm just going to hang out here i [25:42] hear her little feet on it i can go up [25:43] to the door i can open it and then free [25:46] release her out the door um but that's [25:48] worked in my favor because now she can [25:49] predict it and i've been doing similar [25:51] stuff like that with a lot of my clients [25:53] that have door darting issues that [25:54] happen maybe a lot of times a platform [25:56] next to the door can be even more [25:57] effective than people that want to use [25:59] bells because you don't hear the bells [26:00] ringing the dog just hanging out on the [26:02] platform like hey let's go outside [26:04] whether it's a climb or whether it's a [26:05] cable board i have a cable board [26:07] obsession right now i like bought like [26:08] 100 of them it's a problem [26:11] but yeah having that um that predictable [26:14] pattern has caused her to be now [26:16] proactive be able to predict it and make [26:19] it so i don't have to do so much work [26:22] yeah it makes me think of something that [26:24] tom rose said to my class when i was [26:26] going through as a student and to me [26:29] when he said it it was like whoa that [26:30] sounds crazy you know mind blown but [26:32] it's actually a very simple concept [26:34] basically going off of what you just [26:36] said he was talking about making sure [26:38] that you put the dog's equipment on [26:40] before the dog comes out of their kennel [26:42] and he says and after you've done it [26:44] enough times the dog will stick their [26:45] neck out and wait for you to put the [26:47] collar on because they've learned that [26:49] pattern and some other patterns that are [26:51] really good is like having the dog wait [26:54] before we go through the doorway first [26:56] and not because it has anything to do [26:58] with being the alpha but rather [27:00] everything to do with safety if the dog [27:02] knows i have to wait before the human [27:04] walks through the door then it's much [27:07] less likely of a possibility for the dog [27:09] to run out into traffic or jump out of [27:11] the car into traffic something that [27:13] could be potentially dangerous for the [27:16] dog is there anything else that you [27:17] could think of that could add value to [27:19] people that they're first getting their [27:21] dogs that maybe our conversation has [27:23] triggered a thought yes um [27:26] let's talk about preventing [27:29] preventing behavior so a lot of times [27:31] owners they get so excited about their [27:33] new puppy [27:34] puppy gets the room of the house [27:37] and puppy makes mistakes puppy learns [27:39] from those mistakes and starts doing [27:40] those frequently um [27:42] rather than just bringing our puppies [27:44] home letting them go crazy hey here's [27:47] the house enjoy your new home [27:49] we have to work up to that our clients [27:51] give the dogs too much freedom too soon [27:54] which results in the majority of [27:56] behavioral problems or just puppy issues [27:58] that we see whether that is potty [28:01] training like if if you're not watching [28:03] your puppy they're likely doing [28:04] something wrong they're likely in the [28:06] other room taking a poop on the rug good [28:08] times love that [28:10] but if you were to work up to that [28:12] rather than just letting them have [28:14] freedom of the house through um [28:17] through maybe using exercise pens crates [28:20] tethering [28:22] when you're not watching that puppy for [28:24] just a few seconds putting them in their [28:25] crate it's amazing the difference you [28:28] see in dogs that were raised that way [28:30] versus oh you're just you're good to go [28:33] you can just run around and do whatever [28:35] you want [28:36] the dog has to earn that freedom and [28:38] it's one of those things where when we [28:40] have a baby we don't just let them here [28:42] baby here's the whole house have a good [28:44] time [28:45] we work up to that through how their [28:47] brain develops right now baby is much [28:49] slower developing than dogs are but as [28:51] the dog's brain develops and they start [28:54] to have good habits they start to earn [28:56] more freedom right because that that's a [28:58] huge one [28:59] huge one um that's where we see dogs [29:01] that struggle with separation anxiety [29:04] potty training chewing [29:06] um [29:07] getting into the garbage counter surfing [29:10] that's where it starts if you can [29:12] prevent that [29:14] always watch your puppy [29:15] you're good like you're good that's the [29:18] number one thing in my opinion yeah [29:21] that's excellent i'm glad you brought [29:22] that up too because i don't know why [29:24] that did not come to mind right away but [29:26] that's a very very good point to make [29:28] and what about for those people that say [29:31] well i feel bad putting my dog in a [29:33] kennel or i feel bad keeping my puppy in [29:36] a playpen i want him to run around and [29:38] be free even though that sounds great i [29:42] mean you already answered the question [29:44] it causes all those additional problems [29:46] now you're running into potty training [29:48] issues because you didn't see the dog go [29:49] to the bathroom you're running into [29:51] issues where the dog has now chewed on [29:53] multiple pieces of furniture and now [29:55] it's a built-in habit that's going to [29:57] take much longer to break that bad habit [30:00] from the dog and of course if somebody [30:01] lets the dog practice it for too long [30:04] then what ends up happening is they end [30:06] up getting rid of the dog so taking the [30:10] steps in the very beginning even though [30:12] it may feel bad putting them into a into [30:14] the crate it's also important to [30:16] understand though that dogs are den [30:18] animals they enjoy being there it's a [30:20] comfortable place for them as long as we [30:22] make it a comfortable place for them so [30:25] um before we end this [30:28] interview [30:29] where can people find you where can they [30:31] get a hold of you if they're in your [30:32] area and they want to sign up for [30:34] training i mean i can't recommend you [30:36] enough to people

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 352/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another episode in [00:02] today's video i'll be sharing all the [00:04] questions and answers from my tic toc [00:06] channel this past week in the [00:08] description you can find the time stamp [00:10] that will jump to any question that [00:12] you're interested in hearing the answer [00:14] for also don't forget to hit that like [00:16] button and please enjoy [00:18] the only question i have is how is she [00:20] going to know when to stay when you're [00:22] only saying yes for the dog to stay [00:24] first we need to understand marker [00:26] training and there are two markers that [00:27] we use that predict positive [00:29] reinforcement [00:30] the first one is the continuation marker [00:32] i like to use the word yes this is a [00:34] word or sound that lets the dog know [00:36] that they are correct and they will be [00:37] delivered a reward it's called a [00:39] continuation marker because unlike the [00:41] terminal marker it doesn't release the [00:43] dog meaning if your dog is in a [00:44] commanded stay you can use this marker [00:47] without releasing them from the stay and [00:50] allowing them to understand that they're [00:51] doing the behavior correctly however if [00:53] your dog is not in a commanded stay then [00:56] it just means that they'll be given a [00:58] reward so it often confuses people [01:00] because of the terminology continuation [01:03] this is why it's easier to understand [01:05] what our words mean to our dogs based on [01:07] what they predict a continuation marker [01:09] predicts a reward that's it it doesn't [01:12] change the dog's circumstances so if the [01:14] dog is in a stay they remain in the [01:16] state and if the dog is not in a state [01:18] then they remain free from the state in [01:20] contrast we have the terminal marker i [01:23] like to use the word free this is a [01:25] release word but it also guarantees a [01:27] reward so for example if your dog was in [01:30] a sit stay and you use the terminal [01:33] marker they are released from that [01:34] position and they are guaranteed a [01:36] reward for doing the behavior correctly [01:38] so the dog's in a sit indicating the [01:40] completion of the sit so when we give [01:43] our dog a verbal command such as sit the [01:45] dog is in a sit stay if we lure our dogs [01:48] into a sit but we don't say sit then the [01:50] dog is not in a stay so it means when [01:53] we're teaching a stay we don't have to [01:55] say stay the stay is implied when we put [01:58] our dogs into a commanded position [01:59] however some people do feel more [02:02] comfortable saying the word stay and if [02:04] that's the case with you feel free to [02:06] use the word as it will not negatively [02:08] impact the training once in a stay we [02:11] have three ways of maintaining and three [02:13] ways of releasing them the three ways to [02:15] maintain the state would be one use the [02:17] continuation marker which predicts a [02:20] reward but no release my continuation [02:22] marker again is yes two provide verbal [02:26] praise verbal feedback to let the dog [02:28] know they are doing the behavior [02:29] correctly or three you say nothing at [02:32] all the three ways to release the dog [02:34] from the state would be one use a [02:35] release word which lets the dog know [02:37] they can get up but it doesn't guarantee [02:39] a reward i use the word break [02:42] two use the terminal marker which [02:44] predicts release and reward my terminal [02:46] marker is free or three give the dog a [02:49] new command i hope this answered your [02:52] question and this one is in reference to [02:54] my youtube video titled easily teach [02:56] your dog the stay command and if you [02:58] want to learn more about marker training [03:00] check out my youtube video titled marker [03:02] dog training in the four quadrants of [03:04] opera conditioning thanks for watching [03:07] what happens when you have two siblings [03:09] do you train them at the same time or [03:12] one at a time [03:14] if i have two dogs that live together [03:16] that need to be trained then i start by [03:18] training each one separately we have to [03:21] look at another dog the same way we [03:23] would any other distraction remember [03:26] when we're training our dogs with reward [03:28] based training we're competing with [03:30] everything else in the dog's environment [03:33] this is why the ideal first training [03:35] location is a completely empty room [03:39] basically it's a good idea to gradually [03:42] introduce your dog to increasingly [03:44] challenging environments such as another [03:47] dog in the room and levels of obedience [03:50] training this includes the levels of the [03:52] task [03:53] levels of obedience levels of [03:56] proficiency and the intensity of the [03:58] dog's environment without being aware of [04:00] these guidelines you could be in for a [04:02] lot of problems during your training for [04:05] example don't ask for an advanced task [04:07] from a dog that is still at a lower [04:09] proficiency level in a high intense [04:11] environment you'd be setting yourself [04:14] and the pup up for failure on the flip [04:16] side if you're just starting your [04:18] training and you're at a low obedience [04:20] level then start in a low-key [04:22] environment using beginner tasks such as [04:25] engagement training or luring so before [04:28] training both dogs together make sure [04:30] each dog knows and understands all of [04:33] their communication channels this means [04:35] that you've done engagement training [04:37] with both dogs luring and leash pressure [04:40] training then start working on simple [04:42] tasks in low intensity environments for [04:44] example i always like to start with the [04:47] climb stay also known as the bed stay [04:49] since it's such an easy exercise that [04:51] doesn't require much training as your [04:53] dogs are successful slowly increase the [04:56] difficulty of the tasks as well as the [04:58] environment and if you notice that you [05:00] have progressed too quickly you can [05:03] always go back a step in the training if [05:05] you want to learn more about this [05:07] subject check out my video on youtube [05:09] titled socializing and training your dog [05:12] with distractions thanks again for [05:14] watching [05:15] is it okay to toss your dog a treat [05:17] after giving them the continuation [05:19] marker as opposed to handing it to them [05:22] yes and no since it depends on the [05:24] situation basically if your dog is in a [05:27] state command and you use your [05:29] continuation marker then you wouldn't [05:31] want to toss the treat unless you're 100 [05:34] sure that your dog will catch the treat [05:37] and that your dog won't break the stay [05:39] to retrieve the treat if he or she had [05:41] missed it however if your dog is not in [05:44] a stay and you use your continuation [05:46] marker then you can throw the treat [05:48] since your dog wouldn't be in a stay to [05:51] break to make things more clear let's [05:53] break down the two markers that predict [05:56] rewards [05:57] the first one is the continuation marker [05:59] i like to use the word yes this is a [06:02] word or sound that lets the dog know [06:04] that they are correct and they will be [06:05] delivered a reward it's called a [06:08] continuation marker because unlike the [06:10] terminal marker it doesn't release the [06:12] dog meaning if your dog is in a [06:14] commanded stay you can use this marker [06:16] without releasing the dog from the state [06:19] however if your dog is not in a [06:21] commanded stay then this marker just [06:23] means that they'll be rewarded therefore [06:26] this often confuses people because of [06:28] the terminology continuation this is why [06:31] it's easier to understand what it [06:33] predicts a continuation marker predicts [06:36] a reward that's it it doesn't change the [06:39] circumstances so if the dog's in a state [06:41] they must remain in the stay and if the [06:44] dog is not in the state then they remain [06:46] free from the state in contrast we have [06:48] the terminal marker i like to use the [06:50] word free [06:51] this releases the dog from the commanded [06:54] position as well as guarantees them a [06:56] reward so if your dog was in a sit stay [06:58] and you used your terminal marker then [07:00] they are released from that position and [07:02] will be given a reward indicating that [07:04] the sit behavior is completed if you [07:06] want to learn more about markers and how [07:09] to use them i'd recommend checking out [07:11] my youtube video titled marker dog [07:13] training and the four quadrants of opera [07:16] conditioning thanks again for watching [07:18] what are your thoughts on starting and [07:20] training your own service dog this [07:22] question is in reference to my youtube [07:23] video titled first 10 steps when [07:26] training a service dog yes of course it [07:28] is possible for someone to train their [07:30] own service dog if they take the proper [07:32] steps and put in the work one of the [07:34] first and most significant mistakes that [07:36] most people make when training their own [07:38] service dog is that they start with the [07:40] wrong dog for some reason people have [07:42] this belief that they can train any dog [07:45] to be a service dog which is far from [07:46] accurate now any breed can be a service [07:49] dog but that doesn't mean that every dog [07:51] has what it takes to be a service dog [07:54] for example when we were filming rescue [07:56] dog to super dog for animal planet we [07:58] spent months visiting every shelter [08:01] daily in the los angeles area to find [08:04] the right dogs and even after all of [08:06] that some of the ones that were selected [08:09] still didn't end up making the cut if [08:11] you're going to train your own service [08:12] dog take the time to find the right dog [08:15] and your highest chance of success would [08:18] be to get a dog from a breeder that [08:20] specifically breeds for service dog [08:22] purposes [08:24] the second mistake is that they don't [08:26] have the time required to put into [08:28] training their own service dog it's not [08:30] always the difficulty of the training [08:32] where people fail but rather the lack of [08:34] time invested into the training process [08:38] i saw the same thing when i was an [08:39] instructor at the tom rose school for [08:41] professional dog trainers the students [08:43] that didn't do well was often because [08:46] they didn't put in the time it takes a [08:48] lot of time dedication and commitment [08:51] when it comes to training a service dog [08:53] lastly if you're going to train your own [08:55] service dog you should be recording and [08:57] reviewing your training sessions as i [09:00] mentioned in other videos this will help [09:02] you identify and fix mistakes that you [09:04] would have never noticed otherwise in [09:06] addition you can send that footage to a [09:08] professional that can help guide and [09:10] direct you to increase your chances of [09:12] success if you want to learn about the [09:14] proven step-by-step process to teach [09:16] your dog any command check out my video [09:19] on youtube titled everything you need to [09:21] know to train your dog thanks for [09:23] watching any ideas on keeping an anxious [09:25] 90 pound lab calm in the vehicle i [09:28] muzzled him because he chewed on my [09:29] seatbelt but he won't lay down and relax [09:32] hem treats don't work tried crating but [09:34] it made it worse if we have a dog that [09:36] is nervous anxious aggressive or fearful [09:38] about something then our best friend is [09:40] going to be counter conditioning and [09:41] desensitization [09:43] as defined by the animal humane society [09:46] counter conditioning means training an [09:48] animal to display a behavior that is [09:49] different than its current reaction to a [09:52] stimulus [09:53] desensitization is the process of [09:55] exposing the animal to a stimulus [09:57] beginning at a very low intensity [10:00] counter conditioning and desensitization [10:02] need to be used together to be effective [10:05] and are often used to change unwanted [10:07] behaviors in dogs and cats especially [10:10] fearful and aggressive behaviors [10:13] i would start by gradually introducing [10:15] my dog to the vehicle and having it [10:16] predict something pleasant perhaps [10:18] through training using it as a climb and [10:20] a stay command i would do this for a [10:22] week or so without actually taking my [10:24] dog anywhere in the car the following [10:26] week i would take very short drives [10:28] around the neighborhood quickly [10:30] returning back to the house or if you [10:32] have a park nearby i would drive my dog [10:34] to the park and i would play a game that [10:36] my dog enjoys such as fetch or tug while [10:40] incorporating the dog's obedience by [10:42] doing this every day we would be [10:43] changing what the car means to the dog [10:45] by changing what it predicts basically [10:48] you want the dog to end up enjoying the [10:50] vehicle because it almost always [10:52] guarantees something that adds value to [10:55] the dog's life instead of something that [10:57] adds stress if you want to learn more [10:59] about this check out my video on youtube [11:01] titled confidence building counter [11:04] conditioning and desensitization [11:06] thanks for watching [11:08] is it normal for a seven month old [11:09] pitsky to still be biting [11:12] yes it's normal if the puppy enjoys [11:15] fighting this would be considered a [11:17] self-reinforcing behavior when puppies [11:19] under the age of six months bite it's [11:22] usually due to the puppy teething this [11:24] is why it's important for us to supply [11:26] the puppy with plenty of chew toys to [11:29] satisfy that intense need to chew as i [11:32] mentioned in my youtube video how to [11:34] stop puppy biting most pups will stop [11:37] teething when their adult teeth come in [11:39] usually around six months of age however [11:42] if the biting has turned into a game and [11:44] the pup gets a good feeling from play [11:46] biting then it can continue well into [11:48] adulthood this isn't as bad as it may [11:51] sound if we incorporate play biting into [11:53] our training it can help teach the puppy [11:56] bite restriction if that's something [11:57] that you care about and we can control [12:00] the play so it's on our terms if i have [12:02] a dog that enjoys play biting let's say [12:05] my arm beyond six months of age [12:07] then i slowly start to remove the fun [12:09] from the game and i redirect all the fun [12:12] to a tug toy through obedience as a [12:15] reward this provides the dog with that [12:17] same positive feeling that the dog had [12:19] while play biting your arm were [12:21] basically changing the dog's habit [12:23] lastly i start to treat the play biting [12:26] as i would any other privilege such as [12:28] jumping on the furniture it's okay when [12:30] i give the dog the command but they [12:32] can't do it whenever they please we can [12:35] teach this in a very clear and [12:37] stress-free way by implementing leash [12:40] pressure training and of course if you [12:42] never want your dog to play bite your [12:44] arm then don't reward it and if it [12:46] continues your best option is to correct [12:48] it out of the dog's repertoire there's a [12:50] process to this that i explain in great [12:53] detail in my obedience and behavioral [12:55] modification flowchart episode on my [12:58] youtube channel be sure to check it out [13:00] and thanks again for watching [13:02] why is it wrong to introduce a behavior [13:04] whether using luring or physical [13:06] positioning with its verbal cue why is [13:09] the separation required [13:12] first it's essential to understand [13:14] overshadowing as it applies to dog [13:16] training this is when two or more things [13:19] are presented to a dog at the exact same [13:21] time whichever is more relevant to the [13:23] dog is what the dog will focus on and [13:26] the dog will completely ignore the other [13:28] element for example saying yes at the [13:30] same time we deliver the reward or [13:33] saying down at the same time we point to [13:35] the ground this is also what ivan pavlov [13:38] proved in his famous study with dogs and [13:40] his work in classical conditioning when [13:43] we're teaching our dogs a behavior [13:45] before we put it on a command we want to [13:48] make sure that we can get the dog to do [13:51] the behavior every time the way that we [13:53] like with the physical cue [13:56] once that's accomplished then we are [13:58] ready to add the command look at it the [14:00] same as questions and answers the [14:02] command is the question and the physical [14:05] cue is the answer [14:07] meaning when we give our dogs a command [14:09] we're basically asking them a question [14:12] so when you tell your dog down you're [14:14] saying hey buddy do you know what to do [14:16] when i tell you down and your dog says [14:18] no i don't know what to do when you tell [14:20] me down so then we provide them with the [14:23] answer by using the physical cue [14:25] just like you can't ask someone a [14:27] question and provide them with the [14:29] answer at the exact same time we don't [14:31] want to give our dog a command and a [14:34] physical cue at the exact same time they [14:38] must be separated by about a half second [14:40] or so [14:41] down [14:42] then the cue [14:44] question [14:45] then the answer and then we continue to [14:47] do this every day until one day we give [14:49] our dog a command and before we can give [14:52] them the answer they provide it for us [14:54] if you want to learn more about this [14:56] check out my youtube video titled dog [14:58] training the four keys to success thanks [15:01] for watching [15:02] can leash pressure be taught to an 11 [15:05] week old puppy [15:07] yes you can teach a dog leash pressure [15:09] at any age as long as they are [15:12] comfortable in their new environment and [15:14] they understand the concept of luring [15:16] when it comes to working with our dogs [15:18] we want to make sure that they're happy [15:21] and comfortable in their new environment [15:23] before starting any training program [15:26] basically you never want to start [15:28] obedience training with a dog that is [15:30] still adjusting the reason for this is [15:33] our dogs will associate the training [15:35] with however they are currently feeling [15:38] meaning if your puppy feels nervous or [15:40] anxious and you start training them then [15:42] the puppy will associate that feeling [15:44] with the training however once the pup [15:47] is well adjusted then you'll be ready to [15:50] start your training when working with [15:52] our dogs we want to follow the proven [15:54] step-by-step process first the markers [15:57] then the luring and then the leash [15:59] pressure see dogs have what's known as a [16:01] classical opposition reflex this means [16:04] when we put a leash on our dogs their [16:05] instinct is to pull against it with [16:08] leash pressure training we'll show our [16:09] dogs that if they follow the leash [16:11] instead of resisting it good things will [16:14] happen in order for this to work two [16:16] things must take place [16:18] once the pressure is turned on it can't [16:20] be turned off until the dog complies and [16:22] the moment the dog complies the pressure [16:24] must instantly be turned off [16:26] traditionally leash pressure training [16:28] was considered a mildly stressful [16:31] exercise however if the dog knows luring [16:34] then we can remove the stress entirely [16:37] look at it this way when we apply the [16:39] pressure we are presenting our dogs with [16:41] a problem we're saying do you know how [16:43] to turn off this pressure and if we [16:45] don't give the dog the answer then they [16:47] will cycle through different [16:49] possibilities such as resisting biting [16:52] at the leash rolling on the ground and [16:54] so on but if we give them the answer [16:57] then we instantly remove all of the [16:59] stress and the lure is the answer for [17:02] example if we want to use leash pressure [17:04] to get the dog into the down position we [17:06] apply the pressure first then once the [17:08] dog feels the pressure we lure the dog [17:10] into the down position with a piece of [17:12] food once the dog is in the position we [17:14] turn off the leash pressure mark and [17:16] reward the behavior if done correctly [17:19] most dogs can learn this training within [17:22] one to three days if you want to learn [17:24] more about leash pressure training i'd [17:26] recommend checking out my youtube video [17:28] titled how to use a leash to stop 90 of [17:32] behavioral problems leash pressure [17:34] training [17:35] thanks again for watching my german [17:37] shepherd is certainly conditioned to my [17:39] markers however i'm not sure how to [17:41] teach her to sit because she's learned [17:43] to automatically sit and look up at me [17:45] when it's time to train and not give me [17:47] a chance to teach her the sit this is a [17:50] common issue that a lot of people run [17:52] into when they're ready to teach their [17:53] dog the verbal command the dog is [17:55] already sitting because they're looking [17:57] up and remember wherever the nose goes [17:58] the butt does the opposite so when they [18:00] look up at us they naturally sit now her [18:03] command of sit is the word sit since she [18:05] knows the verbal command for that i'm [18:07] going to use the word asi she doesn't [18:09] know that so you can see how the timing [18:11] works with the command and then the [18:13] physical cue that's going to get her to [18:15] do the behavior we're going to do the [18:16] backwards follow exercise to make sure [18:18] that she's not already sitting before we [18:20] give the command it should look [18:22] something like this also note when she [18:24] sits i'm going to use the terminal [18:26] marker for her i taught her when i give [18:28] the terminal marker to jump up and get [18:30] the reward so she will be jumping up if [18:32] you don't want your dog to jump up just [18:34] make sure you don't teach that in the [18:36] beginning when you're doing the terminal [18:38] marker but for her i've taught her to do [18:40] that so she's doing what i'm asking her [18:42] to do all right so it should look [18:44] something like this [18:47] i see then we lift [18:48] free then we reward see there's that [18:50] jump i was telling you about [18:53] and me staying free when her butt hits [18:54] the ground that's telling her she did it [18:56] correctly i see [18:58] free [18:59] good [19:00] let's do a couple more i see [19:04] free [19:05] good girl [19:07] i see [19:09] free and if you wanted your dog to [19:11] maintain the position then you can use [19:12] the continuation marker i see [19:15] yes [19:17] now you have your dog in the sit stay [19:19] and you're going to continue to do this [19:20] up until the point where you give your [19:22] dog the command and your dog sits before [19:25] you have to present the physical cue i [19:27] hope this answered your question and [19:28] thanks for watching [19:30] my nine month old pup has been trained [19:31] with your methods and she's a superstar [19:33] except i can't stop her hassling my 16 [19:35] year old husquita she will stop when i [19:38] say leave and come away but i would [19:40] really like her to not start in the [19:41] first place is there a way to achieve [19:43] this [19:45] when dogs practice a behavior we don't [19:46] like but it's not dangerous or [19:48] destructive we have a specific process [19:50] we want to follow based on your question [19:53] it sounds like you've already completed [19:55] the first four steps of the process but [19:57] i'm quickly going to explain each step [19:59] for those new to this training system [20:01] first we want to work on engagement [20:03] training this encourages our dogs to [20:05] become invested in the training teaches [20:08] them to focus on us helps with opera [20:10] conditioning and teaches them two [20:12] markers that predict positive [20:14] reinforcement the second step is to [20:16] teach them the concept of luring it's a [20:19] simple process that encourages our dogs [20:21] to follow our hands to get access to a [20:23] reward this gives us the ability to show [20:26] our dogs multiple behaviors that we like [20:28] and since the behaviors predict a reward [20:31] it creates a strong and often lifelong [20:33] positive association to the training the [20:36] third step is the concept of leash [20:38] pressure which should really be called a [20:40] leash cue dogs have what's known as a [20:42] classical opposition reflex when we pull [20:45] on the leash they naturally resist this [20:47] training shows our dogs that following [20:49] the leash will make good things happen [20:52] this helps with loose leash walking [20:54] teaching the stay command confidence [20:56] building and showing our dogs what [20:58] behaviors are not allowed without having [21:00] to use a correction right away [21:02] the fourth step is to teach the dog what [21:04] behaviors are unacceptable by using the [21:06] first three steps to clearly communicate [21:09] with them so for this question the [21:11] younger dog is hassling the older dog [21:14] the moment the younger dog starts [21:16] unwanted behavior i would say wrong [21:18] which is my marker for leash pressure [21:21] negative reinforcement you can use [21:23] whatever words you like just be [21:24] consistent then i would use the leash [21:26] cue to direct the puppy to the preferred [21:29] behavior i would continue to do this [21:31] until i said wrong and the pups stop the [21:34] behavior on their own [21:36] this would bring me to step five now [21:38] that the dog knows the rules it's fair [21:40] to implement a correction positive [21:42] punishment a correction is anything the [21:45] dog doesn't like so in order for this to [21:47] work the motivation to not receive the [21:50] correction must override the motivation [21:52] to do the bad behavior [21:53] if you've done the first four steps [21:55] correctly and the correction is adequate [21:57] for that dog then the behavior issue [21:59] should quickly become a problem of the [22:02] past if you want to learn more about [22:04] this i would suggest watching my youtube [22:06] videos titled everything you need to [22:07] know to train your dog and obedience and [22:10] behavioral modification flowchart thanks [22:13]

prestige [00:42] protection dogs please welcome spencer [00:45] bowman [00:46] thanks for joining us everyone today on [00:48] another episode i am here with [00:50] protection specialist spencer bowman and [00:52] we're going to be talking about [00:53] protection dogs as well as sport [00:55] protection dogs so thanks for joining us [00:58] today i really appreciate it first [00:59] question how would you define a [01:01] protection dog hey thanks for having me [01:03] um so protection dog is for us is a dog [01:07] that's friendly and social with family [01:09] members and also can do the protection [01:12] work that's needed to protect their [01:14] family protect their home [01:15] there's protection dogs there's estate [01:17] protection dogs family protection dogs [01:20] personal protection dogs different kind [01:22] of variations of them [01:23] and depending on which which dog people [01:26] go with can kind of determine you know [01:27] how social that dog is or what their job [01:29] specifically is but for us it's the the [01:32] first and foremost thing is that the dog [01:33] is very friendly and social but can also [01:36] turn on real situations and protect [01:37] their owners [01:39] that's perfect and when getting a [01:41] protection dog you like to start from [01:43] when they're a puppy or do you start [01:44] when they're a little bit older [01:46] yeah so we tip we typically start i mean [01:48] any protection dog can definitely be [01:49] started as a puppy [01:51] obviously it's a lot better if you start [01:52] as a puppy we don't tend to select our [01:55] dogs that are going to go into actual [01:57] homes until they're a little bit older [01:59] to give an example we might raise four [02:00] or five puppies at one time and then [02:02] determine later later when they're a [02:03] little older you know six months to a [02:05] year old [02:06] if they're going to have the right [02:07] temperament to be a personal protection [02:08] dog um because the temperament is so [02:10] important to us we're looking for [02:13] quality over quantity so we're [02:14] definitely looking for those special [02:15] dogs that have the right temperament and [02:17] with puppies you just don't know [02:18] sometimes sometimes they're you know [02:20] very social and very good as a puppy or [02:22] you know and then they get older and [02:23] they have you know little quirks or [02:25] problems so we definitely start the work [02:27] when they're young but we're we're going [02:29] to reevaluate them when they're older [02:30] and determine if they're going to be a [02:32] good fit for our program or not [02:34] now do you breed your own puppies for [02:36] your protection program or do you get [02:38] them from certain breeders that you have [02:39] a good relationship with that has [02:41] a high probability of producing a dog [02:44] that's going to make a really good [02:45] family or personal protection dog [02:48] so we do i do have a breeding program uh [02:50] prestige malinois um we typically don't [02:52] most of our puppies aren't suitable for [02:54] what i would consider home protection [02:56] just because the drive level of them are [02:59] a little bit more intense and a little [03:00] bit more suited for the sport work um [03:02] which we'll probably talk about later [03:04] but so we we definitely do have some of [03:06] that come through our breeding program [03:07] that we'll we'll place in protection [03:09] homes but [03:10] as a whole most of them are are [03:12] typically geared our breeding program is [03:13] more geared towards the sport aspect of [03:15] things and we typically go to other [03:17] breeders for [03:18] um more suitable dogs for home [03:20] protection um also we typically like the [03:22] german shepherd more for home protection [03:24] we do we do use malinois we do use [03:26] dobermans and other breeds but our [03:28] favorite and kind of go-to is the german [03:30] shepherd and i breed malinois so most of [03:32] the time it's it's not quite what we're [03:33] looking for for our program [03:35] and so you use the malinois i'm guessing [03:38] primarily for french ring because that's [03:39] how i met you and i mean i have to say i [03:42] learned a lot from training with you the [03:43] short amount of time that we train [03:44] together and i was incredibly impressed [03:47] with your ability to move in a way to [03:50] train that dog for protection work and [03:52] being in that bite suit [03:54] that is not easy i mean people see that [03:56] and they're like oh you just have a suit [03:58] on and the dog bites you but there is [04:00] so much to it what got you involved with [04:03] that training and how did you get i mean [04:05] in my opinion you're one of the best [04:07] protection decoys that i had the [04:09] opportunity to train with how did you [04:10] get that point to being so good at being [04:12] able to read the dogs know when to give [04:14] them the bite how to work on that grip [04:16] the little details that someone who's [04:18] spectating [04:19] may not be able or be aware of [04:22] yeah definitely i appreciate the kind [04:23] words um so we typically yeah i mean [04:25] french ring mondeo ring those are kind [04:27] of our main focus with our with our [04:28] sport dogs and breeding program um you [04:30] know as far as getting started in it [04:32] about 12 13 years ago i i got into [04:35] pet dogs and protection dogs actually at [04:36] the same exact time so i was [04:38] living in southern california had an [04:40] unruly dog [04:41] you know seeked out some trainers um was [04:43] lucky enough to come across an awesome [04:45] trainer by the name of larry hansen [04:47] met with her she was kind of a bully [04:49] specialist and i had a bully breed at [04:50] the time helped me a lot with him um as [04:53] far as pet dog training and then she [04:54] introduced me to ringsport i went out to [04:57] her club scabber at the time [04:59] and then i was fortunate enough to train [05:00] with her adrian centeno um the whole [05:03] kind of southern california scabber crew [05:04] for a little bit and then i moved to [05:06] arizona did some some work there with [05:08] chad hunter for a while learned a lot [05:10] from him as well too and then over the [05:12] last several years actually i would say [05:14] in the last three to five years has kind [05:16] of been where i've really [05:17] gained a lot more experience and and [05:19] gotten a lot better in the suit and [05:21] training the dogs has been going [05:22] overseas to france so i've been [05:23] traveling to france for the last several [05:25] years [05:26] multiple times a year i've spent several [05:28] months out of the last couple years in [05:29] france training and learning from in my [05:32] opinion one of the best french ring [05:33] trainers in the world over there he was [05:35] my mentor for a while so that was that [05:37] was a really cool experience and i got [05:38] to learn a lot doing that [05:40] oh that's amazing what an awesome [05:42] opportunity and for people who are not [05:44] aware of the different protection sports [05:46] at least the main ones in the united [05:48] states is the french ring mondo ring psa [05:51] and should sin now french ring in my [05:53] opinion i'm assuming you may agree you [05:56] probably will agree but [05:57] being a decoy in that sport is probably [06:00] the most challenging and takes the most [06:02] amount of discipline physical fitness [06:04] understanding of the sport being able to [06:06] read the dogs and time it so saying that [06:09] you've gotten better in the past few [06:11] years and i haven't trained with you [06:12] since i think 2016 2015 and back then [06:15] you were blown me away at how much skill [06:17] you had in that suit so why is it that [06:20] french ring decoys that are from france [06:23] tend to have a higher skill set than [06:26] some of the decoys here in the united [06:27] states what makes them so much better at [06:30] least you know from my experience they [06:32] are really impressive to see what they [06:33] can do out there yeah absolutely i mean [06:35] all the all the protection sports [06:37] definitely have their things and [06:38] difficulties and and you know challenges [06:40] in the suit but like you said it's being [06:42] a french ring decoy is probably one of [06:43] the hardest hardest in the world as far [06:45] as you know mentally physically and and [06:47] takes a toll on your body but um [06:49] yeah i mean just uh you know going over [06:52] there and and the the french decoys you [06:53] know the the advantage that they have is [06:55] they start really young as the first and [06:57] first thing you know those guys are [06:58] getting to suit some of them 10 years [07:00] old 12 years old i mean it's incredible [07:01] whereas you know i started when i was 20 [07:03] years old [07:04] you know they have a lot more experience [07:06] they also have a lot more access to dogs [07:08] we have very few ring three you know [07:10] which is the highest level in french [07:11] ring here in the united states dogs it's [07:13] getting better we have a lot more now [07:14] but over there they have you know [07:16] thousands um they're their big event for [07:18] the year they're they're pre-selectives [07:20] and their selectives has you know [07:21] thousands of dogs their selectives goes [07:23] down to about 240 dogs and then it goes [07:25] down to you know the 30 top in in the [07:28] country so they just have a lot more [07:29] access to to work dogs they have a lot [07:31] more people with experience and and so [07:33] they're able to really get you know i [07:35] would say a double triple the experience [07:37] of us sometimes in the same amount of [07:38] time just with the the amount of dogs [07:40] and access they have to that sport [07:42] so they're able to have more time in the [07:44] suit of course fighting more dogs as you [07:46] said which yeah that definitely makes [07:48] sense and for people that are interested [07:50] in becoming more involved with [07:52] protection training i get messages all [07:54] the time people either want a protection [07:55] dog or they want to learn how to train a [07:58] protection dog or at least do some of [07:59] the foundational training what advice [08:02] would you give them as far as what to [08:04] seek out what to look for and what would [08:06] be their best approach to [08:08] learning how to do that [08:10] yeah i mean the first thing is just [08:11] finding a mentor you know there's [08:13] obviously through the years as you get [08:14] more experience you'll you'll find teams [08:16] and mentors that you want to work with [08:18] personally but in the beginning it's [08:19] really just more about finding somebody [08:20] to help you um you know you want to find [08:22] the right person obviously but reaching [08:24] out to people that you might know that [08:25] have experience in this field [08:27] you can go on google and look up north [08:28] american ring sport federation that's [08:30] the governing body for furniture in the [08:32] united states and they have information [08:34] on there you can contact local clubs you [08:36] can contact decoys judges [08:39] the organization itself for mondo ring [08:41] same thing united states mondo ring [08:43] association you can go to their website [08:45] and look up the exact same so i [08:46] definitely look up and you know find [08:48] your nearest club [08:50] i would definitely recommend people go [08:51] to the sites and find a club rather than [08:52] just look up people that are doing a [08:54] ring you know rig sport because there's [08:55] a lot of people that are doing ring [08:57] sport throughout the country but might [08:58] not be affiliated with the organization [09:00] so they might not have as much [09:02] experience [09:03] i'm not saying that's always the case [09:04] but but it's definitely a good start to [09:06] find a local club or the nearest club to [09:08] you to find somebody with some [09:09] experience and and reach out and you [09:11] know it's it's definitely a thing you [09:12] got to put your time in so going out and [09:14] long hours and and learning as much as [09:16] you can but that's definitely where i [09:18] would start is just looking up a local [09:19] club [09:20] and get in that bite suit and sweat and [09:22] half the day away while you're working [09:24] those dogs [09:26] what was some of the things that you [09:28] struggled with in the very beginning [09:30] when you were learning i mean for me it [09:32] was getting comfortable in that suit and [09:34] also [09:35] getting past i mean you never seem to [09:36] have one of the issues that i had which [09:38] was i i do have a bit of fear of the [09:42] dogs like the protection work i was [09:43] always afraid of possibly slipping and [09:46] getting hit in the face and of course [09:48] during trials i mean decoys get injured [09:50] that's why they have a backup decoy [09:53] so for me it was getting past that fear [09:55] what were some of the struggles that you [09:57] had to work through when you were first [09:59] learning how to become a decoy and maybe [10:01] that will help other people who are also [10:03] trying to become a decoy and get to your [10:05] level [10:06] yeah i mean my [10:08] i would say i had i definitely had i [10:09] didn't have a fear in the beginning but [10:11] i would say early on in my career i [10:12] definitely got the fear initially but i [10:14] was able to get over it just because [10:15] what actually i got i got bit in the [10:17] hand with one of my first first trials i [10:19] ever decoyed i got my whole hand tore [10:20] open um and [10:22] since then it's happened probably one or [10:24] two more times um you know that was [10:26] probably five six years ago but having [10:28] those kind of situations definitely [10:30] taught me to get over the fear a little [10:31] bit um before that i i would say i was a [10:33] little cockier in the suit and didn't [10:35] think that would happen and then when it [10:36] happened i definitely learned to [10:38] be a little more careful with where i [10:40] put my hands and things like that um you [10:42] know the biggest i think the my biggest [10:44] issue as a decoy when i was learning was [10:46] that i'm not really the most athletic [10:48] person so i'm i'm obviously young and [10:50] i'm fit and all that but i'm not a [10:52] athlete by any means i you know i [10:54] wrestled in high school i played [10:55] basketball but i was never the the [10:57] athlete i don't run very fast i don't [10:59] run very far [11:00] um you know so so getting in the suit is [11:03] is [11:04] people excel at it when they're athletes [11:05] typically so for me the hardest part was [11:07] how do i how do i get better in the suit [11:10] when i'm not an athlete and for me that [11:12] came down to timing reading the dogs and [11:14] learning how to be quicker in the suit [11:16] but not necessarily fast you know [11:18] exploding better making sure my timing [11:20] was better when i moved to catch the [11:22] dogs when i moved to a ski the dogs [11:23] which is you know making them miss [11:25] and so yeah just just kind of focusing [11:27] on the timing and the quickness of it [11:29] was was really big for me because i [11:31] definitely am by no means an actual [11:32] athlete [11:34] that's awesome i love that i mean one of [11:35] the things i do is i also train [11:36] jiu-jitsu and sometimes the guys who are [11:39] not as big and strong they have to be [11:41] more technical and because of that [11:42] they're able to teach things that maybe [11:44] some of the other guys are not able to [11:45] teach so i think that's probably [11:47] something that has benefited you in your [11:50] career in becoming a decoy and training [11:52] these protection dogs now someone who's [11:54] interested in getting a protection dog [11:56] what is one of the first places that [11:58] they can start in doing their research [11:59] so not training it themselves but [12:01] getting one for the family what should [12:03] they be looking for [12:04] i think first and foremost they have to [12:06] kind of look at their lifestyle before [12:08] they even look at getting a dog and just [12:09] make sure that you know in theory a [12:11] protection dog sounds great um you know [12:13] but it's it's a commitment just like [12:14] getting a normal dog and [12:16] doing training with it you have to make [12:17] sure you have the time to exercise it [12:19] you have the finances to take care of [12:21] the dog if things go wrong [12:23] you know making just making sure that [12:24] your lifestyle is going to fit having a [12:26] dog you know if you're very active you [12:28] might want a more active dog if you have [12:29] a kind of laid back lifestyle you might [12:31] want a dog that's a little more calm [12:33] so i think looking at that first and [12:34] just making sure it's a good fit you [12:36] know having a protection dog in general [12:38] and then really it's just a matter of [12:39] doing some research and you know there's [12:41] obviously a lot of information on google [12:42] uh good and bad um you know on youtube [12:45] as well too so it's important for people [12:47] to do some research check out you know [12:48] when they look at a website or they look [12:50] at a protection company the most [12:52] important thing i always tell people [12:53] whether like when people contact us [12:54] whether they buy a dog from us or not i [12:56] always tell them hey make sure that [12:57] you're researching the trainers make [12:58] sure that they have experience you know [13:00] they have credentials they have you know [13:03] they've done either protection [13:04] competitions or have you know lifelong [13:06] experience doing this and helping family [13:08] members with their protection dogs so [13:10] you know looking on google google and [13:12] youtube is definitely going to help them [13:13] but i think it's uh more so important [13:15] that they do dig in a little deeper and [13:16] research the company and the actual [13:18] trainers behind the company it's you [13:19] know as you know it's pretty easy to pop [13:21] up shop and have a website and have it [13:23] look good and everything but it's it's [13:25] important for the trainers to have the [13:27] experience and know what they're doing [13:28] dealing with the real protection dogs so [13:30] i just urge everybody to take a look and [13:32] make sure they do their research [13:34] and that's a really good point you made [13:36] me think of two things so one their [13:38] lifestyle that's something that comes up [13:40] often with service dogs as well people [13:42] think that oh if i get a service dog [13:44] it's gonna do all these things for me [13:45] but the door swings both ways they have [13:47] to be able to still take care of that [13:49] dog feed the dog manage the training and [13:51] the obedience and the other thing that [13:53] it made me think about was [13:55] when somebody gets a protection train [13:56] dog even if it's fully trained it's top [13:59] quality 100 the training's been done it [14:02] doesn't mean that the training's done [14:04] right they have to continue it they have [14:06] to maintain it they probably if they're [14:08] not in your area then they would [14:10] probably have to find a local protection [14:13] trainer to maintain that training or do [14:15] you provide additional resources for [14:17] them so they can continue maintaining [14:19] and working with the dog yeah we [14:21] definitely do we so we we actually offer [14:23] uh what we call like follow-up training [14:25] with with all of our clients so we have [14:26] clients you know all over the world we [14:28] have a client in santiago chile we have [14:30] clients in florida we're in california [14:32] we have a couple clients here so we we [14:34] definitely travel to our clients and do [14:35] follow-up training if they want [14:37] obviously it's a little more expensive [14:38] just because of the fact that we have to [14:39] fly there and take time out of our [14:41] schedule and everything so [14:43] people are allowed to to work with [14:44] another local trainer if they have one [14:46] to maintain training and things like [14:47] that we just give our advice and show [14:49] them what we recommend but we do offer [14:51] that follow-up support and yeah you're [14:52] right i mean it's definitely important [14:54] that they you know the dog you know it's [14:56] kind of like you know buying a nice [14:58] expensive car it comes you know ready to [15:00] go and everything but you have to learn [15:01] how to drive it and then on top of that [15:03] you've got to maintain it you've got to [15:04] do your oil changes you've got to put [15:05] the right gas in it you have to you know [15:07] rotate your tires all that stuff so it's [15:09] the same with the dog they're going to [15:10] get a fully trained dog ready to go out [15:12] the gate but there's gonna be some [15:13] follow-up training they're gonna have to [15:14] do and maintain and work with that dog [15:16] uh we provide phone and email support [15:18] for our clients as well as the follow-up [15:19] training but they're definitely gonna [15:21] have to do some some work after the fact [15:22] for sure [15:23] yeah absolutely and probably i would [15:25] think joining a protection club would be [15:27] the best way to continue and maintain [15:29] that and if that is the case [15:30] if somebody is getting a family [15:32] protection dog from you what which sport [15:34] would be the more ideal sport to help [15:36] maintain the training [15:39] yeah i mean i would say sometimes [15:40] obviously with protection dogs there's a [15:42] big there's a big difference between a [15:44] sport dog and a protection dog so i [15:45] think sometimes [15:46] um you know you want to be careful with [15:48] saying hey yes you can just take a [15:50] protection dog to a sport dog club and [15:52] it'll help maintain it in the aspect of [15:53] obedience and doing the actual bite work [15:56] protection work itself yes it will but [15:58] you want to make sure that you're [15:58] working with somebody that understands [16:00] the difference between a sport dog and a [16:01] protection dog and the needs of of the [16:02] two different dogs um but i would say if [16:05] you're if you're going to go that route [16:07] you know i would say any of the any of [16:08] the sports probably would be okay to be [16:10] honest with you it's really just finding [16:12] somebody a trainer from that club that's [16:14] experienced and dealing with it [16:16] i i will say i think protection sports [16:18] psa shuts in those kind of sports are a [16:21] little bit more geared towards home [16:23] protection style of training and dogs [16:25] french ring and mondo ring definitely [16:27] are more of the sport aspect it's really [16:29] a big battle between the dog and the [16:31] decoy where and that can definitely help [16:33] for home protection dogs and and i think [16:34] somebody that runs those kind of clubs [16:36] will have be able to help them with the [16:38] dog [16:38] um i would say a little more precision [16:40] in the obedience sometimes in shits and [16:42] is is nice for people to help with their [16:44] their protection dog because they [16:45] sometimes have a higher level of [16:47] obedience than your typical ring dog [16:48] could but honestly i think any of them [16:50] are good um you know psa for example i [16:53] don't personally do psa but i'm very [16:54] very familiar with it and i think [16:56] sometimes they have some some cool [16:57] scenarios and things that are a little [16:59] bit more realistic in real life stuff [17:01] that that could practice with a home [17:02] protection dog but ultimately all the [17:04] sports are just sports so it's really [17:06] more important to find a trainer that [17:07] that knows the difference between sport [17:09] and real protection and [17:11] helps them work through those things [17:13] and that's a good point and how would [17:15] you [17:16] define the difference between a sport [17:18] dog a family protection dog personal [17:21] protection dog what makes them different [17:23] so [17:24] the biggest factor is and this is kind [17:26] of you know obviously a big discussion [17:28] in our industry is is you know can a [17:29] sport dog be a protection dog vice versa [17:31] and the answer is yes and no um there's [17:33] sport dogs out there that are are just [17:35] at sport dogs they will not bite for [17:37] real in a real situation they will not [17:38] protect you in a real situation but [17:40] there's there's the flip side there's [17:41] there's a lot of sport dogs out there [17:42] that are very very real dogs that will [17:44] protect you in situations and so it's [17:46] not so much the dog or the sport you [17:48] know there's no sport in my opinion [17:49] that's real you know psa shuts and [17:51] french ring mondo ring all these sports [17:53] are sports it doesn't mean there's not [17:55] real dogs in them they're real real [17:57] protection dogs but they're they're [17:58] sports first and foremost so in order [17:59] for you to say that that dog knows how [18:01] to do actual protection work you have to [18:03] put them in those situations and and [18:04] work through that and train it so i [18:06] think um you know [18:08] the the biggest difference just being [18:10] that is that there's you know the sport [18:11] is geared more towards it's a points [18:13] thing it's the dogs are meant to be you [18:15] know scored and they're trained a little [18:17] bit differently than than you would a [18:19] home protection dog a home protection [18:20] dog is geared more towards serious [18:21] situations kidnappings home invasions [18:24] you know sport work they're doing you [18:25] know just running up the field bite the [18:26] guy out come back [18:28] and protection dogs are going to do that [18:30] as well too but a lot more scenario type [18:31] training i would say the big that's [18:33] probably the biggest difference [18:35] and so you're training all these [18:37] different scenarios to get the dogs as [18:39] generalized as possible to something [18:41] happening and so something that uh [18:44] people ask like i have this video on [18:47] just teaching a deterrent it doesn't [18:49] actually teach the dog to bite there's [18:51] no aggression it's just using a toy and [18:53] getting the dog to bark but people have [18:55] asked well how is the dog gonna know the [18:57] difference between a real situation and [19:00] a training scenario and does the dog [19:02] know the difference [19:04] yeah absolutely and and with it [19:05] protection dogs you have in my opinion [19:07] you have like a wide variety of them in [19:09] the sense of like we talked earlier you [19:10] have home protection family protection [19:12] estate protection you know to give an [19:14] example like a dog that's gonna go live [19:16] with a family member and they have [19:17] two-year-old kids needs a much more [19:19] social dog than like my client in [19:22] santiago chile has estate protection [19:24] dogs he has a few dogs there that are [19:26] meant to literally protect the property [19:27] if somebody comes on the property [19:29] unannounced they're going to get bit and [19:31] and that's not the type of dog that [19:32] you're going to want to put in a home [19:33] right so there's definitely a big [19:34] difference between certain types of dogs [19:37] in everybody's situation so the most [19:38] important thing is is fitting the dog to [19:40] the owner and and like you said [19:41] sometimes you some people just need a [19:43] deterrent doc they just want a dog that [19:44] will bark on command at somebody and [19:46] they don't even want the dog to bite [19:47] because it's obviously a big liability [19:49] so fitting each dog with each owner is [19:51] is definitely a big factor of it and [19:53] making sure that you're you're providing [19:54] you know if you need to give them a a [19:56] more serious dog because of their [19:58] situation and their lifestyle that's [19:59] what you do if they need a more family [20:01] friendly dog and they just want you know [20:03] the appearance of a protection dog [20:04] that's possible as well too it's really [20:06] fitting that that that client with this [20:08] specific dog and what their needs are [20:10] and if they have kids in the home if [20:11] they have other dogs if they have cats [20:13] you know all those play a factor into [20:14] what type of dog and and also what type [20:16] of training so we we customize all of [20:18] our dogs as well too so we have kind of [20:20] different levels of protection dogs and [20:21] we have a lower level and then we have [20:23] our higher levels where we'll literally [20:24] take a dog if i have a client that calls [20:26] me and says hey i want this dog but i [20:28] need this this and this with the dog [20:29] specifically because of my lifestyle you [20:31] know i travel on a private jet i'm a [20:33] celebrity you know whatever the case may [20:34] be we can customize the dog to do [20:37] specific things and also train them for [20:38] specific scenarios that we know are [20:40] going to be possible that they're going [20:42] to be put into [20:43] and i'm assuming there's probably [20:45] certain standards that you do on every [20:47] dog and then you just build on top of [20:49] that uh i'm assuming obedience is a big [20:52] part of it what's your obedience process [20:54] with these protection dogs yeah [20:56] obedience is definitely a huge one and i [20:57] would say it's it's it's it's one of the [20:59] bigger factors i mean the protection [21:01] work is is definitely huge but you know [21:03] if they can't control this dog in public [21:04] if they can't even walk it down the road [21:06] there's no there's no [21:08] no benefit to biting somebody or [21:09] protecting them if they can't even get [21:10] it under control to begin with so the [21:12] obedience is pretty pretty extensive we [21:14] do you know full on and off leash [21:16] obedience uh come one called sit stays [21:18] down stays healing on and off leash [21:20] right next to them laying on their bed [21:22] on command you know all your typical pet [21:23] stuff but then we take it to a little [21:25] bit higher level we do it all off leash [21:27] we do it under severe distractions these [21:29] dogs go everywhere with us they go to [21:30] grocery stores they go to [21:32] you know pet stores they go to if we [21:34] travel they come with us they come in [21:36] our home and sleep with us at night hang [21:37] out with my personal family and my kid [21:39] and go you know go pretty much just [21:41] about everywhere with us if we go to [21:42] lunch they come out and eat lunch with [21:44] us we go to dinner they come eat dinner [21:45] with us you know so they're they're [21:47] getting used to to going pretty much [21:48] everywhere that that somebody could [21:50] possibly take them for for their [21:52] situation and so the obedience is [21:54] definitely one of the biggest factors [21:55] for sure [21:56] yeah absolutely i couldn't agree more [21:58] and with the protection training how do [22:01] you know when to start working the dog [22:03] in protection whether it's a puppy [22:04] adolescent older uh how are you working [22:07] to teach the dog to bite when to bite [22:09] where to bite all these little things [22:10] that uh are very curious subjects for [22:14] people that don't know anything about [22:15] protection work yeah so uh you know like [22:18] we talked about earlier we definitely [22:19] can start them as puppies and we [22:20] obviously have puppies everything is [22:21] just prey work you know it's getting [22:23] them used to chasing a rag and learning [22:25] how to kind of bite things and and then [22:27] we start to channel it as they get older [22:29] we typically i would say when they get a [22:30] little bit older about you know eight [22:32] months to a year is when we get a little [22:34] more serious with the protection work [22:35] and we start determining you know is [22:37] this dog capable of doing real life type [22:39] protection stuff and then we start [22:41] layering in some some you know more more [22:43] defensive work some scenarios things [22:45] like that [22:46] first and foremost like every dog [22:48] started typically when they're young [22:49] just like prey work you know puppy with [22:50] a rag and and just kind of testing their [22:52] ability to bite and then it's as they [22:54] get older it's the trainer's job to [22:56] to kind of mold them into a protection [22:57] dog and switch you know switch from prey [23:00] to more real-life situations more [23:02] defense sometimes but you know that's [23:04] that's a difficult thing some trainers [23:05] sometimes go a little too far with [23:06] defensive protection stuff [23:08] and sometimes go a little too far with [23:09] prey and it's it's an important thing to [23:11] balance the two and and that's that's a [23:14] definitely an art that that's uh [23:16] always constantly ongoing and perfecting [23:18] and how to do that but typically i would [23:20] say eight months to a year is kind of [23:21] where we see the dogs start to come [23:22] alive a little bit more and where we're [23:24] gonna start to more evaluate them and [23:26] determine what route we're gonna go with [23:27] them if they're gonna continue to be in [23:29] our program if they're gonna be a good [23:30] fit for certain clients and then and [23:32] then again like i said it's just a [23:34] matter of the client and an individual [23:35] dog you know if they have a certain dog [23:37] that they want and they want certain [23:40] things done with it then we have to make [23:41] sure that that dog that we have can do [23:43] it if it can't you know we have to get a [23:44] different one and make sure that we're [23:46] fulfilling kind of the client's needs [23:47] and expectations within the protection [23:49] work as well as the obedience that's [23:51] awesome and when you are transitioning [23:53] the the puppy or the adolescent the [23:55] younger dog from tugs and toys and [23:58] things like that how do you know when to [24:00] transition the dog to a bite suit i'm [24:02] assuming you use a bite suit for the [24:03] protection dogs or do you use a lot of [24:05] sleeve work [24:06] yeah we do we do every just about [24:08] everything so you know hidden sleeves [24:09] we'll do actual sleeves we'll do suits [24:11] um you know muzzle fighting you know [24:13] just about anything that we feel we need [24:15] to do for that dog and again that client [24:16] situation so we definitely definitely [24:19] use kind of all of them [24:20] the the time that we determine that [24:22] we're going to transition them from like [24:24] let's say a puppy sleeve or a rag to an [24:25] actual you know suit or sleeve is going [24:28] to be when we see that the dog has a [24:30] very good grip so they're biting full on [24:33] the sleeve or or the puppy sleeve and [24:34] things and that they're very confident [24:36] about it we don't want a dog to go to a [24:38] suit or a or a you know like an ipo [24:40] style sleeve or something and be [24:43] you know nervous or not be feel like [24:45] they're in control of that situation so [24:47] we're going to make sure they're [24:47] confident and also that they have a [24:49] really nice grip you know obviously in [24:51] protection work the grip doesn't [24:53] necessarily matter as much as like a [24:54] sport dog where they're going to maybe [24:56] grade the grip or something but for me [24:58] it shows confidence in the dog and and [25:00] we we like to see that they have nice [25:01] big grips so that's definitely something [25:03] that we're going to look for before we [25:04] transition them to a suit uh because the [25:06] suit is [25:07] typically it's like less you know it's [25:09] not as [25:10] thick it doesn't feel as good a lot of [25:11] times for the for the puppies so they're [25:13] not going to bite it as well as they [25:14] would like a puppy you know thick sleeve [25:17] so you're really making sure that you [25:18] have the foundation that strong the [25:20] dog's confident and then you go to the [25:22] bite suit if you go to the bite suit and [25:24] you notice there's issues you just go [25:25] back a step and continue to work the [25:27] grip and work the confidence and so on [25:29] yeah absolutely unless unless there's [25:31] some situations where [25:32] you know we've had dogs that might need [25:34] like a different type of suit like they [25:35] might need a jute suit you know [25:36] something that they can sink their teeth [25:38] into a little bit better [25:39] we might have dogs that do need a little [25:41] bit of bungee work or they just need [25:43] some more frustration or something so if [25:44] we feel that we can work through it on [25:46] the suit and they're they're feeling [25:47] good about it and they're confident [25:48] we'll do it but a lot of times yeah [25:50] we're just gonna take a step back and [25:51] rebuild the dog a little bit and then [25:52] come back to the suit it's not as [25:54] important to go to the suit fast it's [25:55] just a matter of making sure the dog's [25:57] ready for that when it's time [25:59] and if you this is going to be a sport [26:01] question and it's something that i've [26:02] had to deal with in the past [26:04] if you have a dog that is having issues [26:07] with something like let's say the pistol [26:10] attack the dog's afraid of the the [26:12] gunfire or in psa the dog might be [26:15] afraid of a bottle curtain or something [26:17] like that that the decoys are using [26:19] what's your best approach to getting the [26:21] dog to work past that fear or that [26:23] discomfort to where the dog is able to [26:26] do that part of the training so for [26:28] example with my dog first time she [26:30] became afraid of the gunfire and she [26:32] went off the bike [26:33] what would be your best approach to [26:34] fixing an issue like that [26:36] so with with anything the dog has issues [26:38] with in in sport work uh the biggest [26:40] thing is just kind of recreating a [26:42] different association with with what [26:44] they're having an issue with and making [26:45] them get comfortable with it i will say [26:47] i i you know i do do do it a little bit [26:49] differently than some people in the [26:50] sense of i do believe that dogs have to [26:52] learn to work through stress a little [26:54] bit um to an extent and so i think that [26:56] you know sometimes with like the gun for [26:59] example or sometimes in sport work they [27:00] have an issue with the baton [27:02] the bamboo stick the clatter stick and i [27:05] i kind of take the approach of yes we're [27:07] going to back up we're going to create [27:08] some good sensations with it and make [27:10] sure that the dog can learn how to [27:11] counter it you know properly but i [27:13] definitely don't dance around it too [27:15] much i mean in the sense of i'm going to [27:16] use that object or whatever it is the [27:18] gunfire of the stick and i'm going to [27:20] teach the dog how to deal with that in a [27:21] way that they feel come out confident [27:22] about it [27:23] especially with sport work a lot of [27:25] puppies sometimes people will look at a [27:26] puppy and it looks a little bit more [27:28] sensitive might have you know they say [27:30] it might have a you know what we call a [27:31] stick issue you know an issue with the [27:33] clatter stick or a gun issue and and [27:36] they might but a lot of times when they [27:38] see that when they're puppies they kind [27:40] of like stop using those things [27:41] altogether and in fear that they're [27:43] going to make it worse and and they you [27:46] know i guess in layman's terms baby the [27:48] dog a little bit and then you know as [27:50] the dog gets older it learns that it can [27:52] be kind of more sensitive in a baby in [27:54] those situations and it never learns how [27:56] to be what we consider like a warrior in [27:58] in ring sport you need a warrior so you [28:00] have to teach the dog that even if it's [28:01] sensitive it has to learn how to [28:02] overcome that so we definitely create [28:04] good associations with it but i would [28:06] say we do it in ways you know and [28:08] obviously it's really difficult to [28:09] explain there's lots of different [28:10] methods we can use and things like that [28:11] but you know teaching them the gunfire [28:14] is a good example you know typically [28:15] with gunfire a lot of times when people [28:17] are teaching it the first time they do [28:18] it is there they have somebody off to [28:20] the side and they're shooting the gun as [28:22] a puppy's running in for the bite you [28:24] know and we i do that a little [28:25] differently i actually have the the [28:27] decoy with the gun and the decoy [28:28] shooting the gun as the dog's being [28:30] dragged in and the decoys running away [28:32] in prey and you know [28:34] shaking a stick or whatever that dog [28:36] associates as fun for that protection [28:38] work and so they're getting used to [28:40] seeing that that person that they love [28:41] and is fun is the one doing that gunfire [28:43] and it's not causing them harm whereas a [28:45] lot of times when you're you know you're [28:47] sending a puppy to to do some protection [28:49] work or sport work and somebody off the [28:51] sidelines is shooting a gun the puppy's [28:53] gonna go oh what's that and they're [28:54] gonna look away and they're gonna be [28:56] weirded out because something from the [28:57] sidelines is is is going off and they [28:59] don't know what it is so i prefer it [29:01] comes from the from the decoy but it [29:03] comes in a way that the puppy is or the [29:05] young dog is successful in that [29:06] situation and that's typically how i [29:08] deal with with like a gunfire problem is [29:10] i would i would have the decoy use it [29:11] and more and pray and running away [29:14] agitation and make it a fun experience [29:16] and then it would slowly close the gap [29:18] and make it closer and closer as the dog [29:20] comes in and then eventually on the bite [29:22] and things like that [29:23] i love that you said that having the [29:25] decoy run away because of course in that [29:27] exercise [29:28] they're usually just standing there as [29:30] the dog comes in but adding that factor [29:32] of them running away i can totally see [29:34] how that would increase the dog's [29:35] confidence and then associated with like [29:37] oh even though i hear that loud gunfire [29:40] they're still running away i'm the one [29:42] in charge of this situation absolutely [29:44] love that so we're actually out of time [29:47] i really appreciate you taking the time [29:49] to come down and talk to us about [29:50] protection training for people that are [29:52] interested in learning more or wanting [29:55] to reach out to possibly get a [29:56]

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 360/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:01] hey everyone welcome to today's live q a [00:05] i'm going to start by answering a [00:06] question that was asked to me previously [00:09] which is how do we determine if a dog is [00:12] going to make it through a service dog [00:14] program or if they need to be dropped [00:15] out of that program it really comes down [00:18] to of course each individual dog and [00:20] whether or not they're able to do the [00:21] tasks that's required of them in order [00:23] to become a service dog something that's [00:25] really big that we look for is whether [00:27] or not the dog is interested in humans [00:30] we want a dog that's going to be very [00:32] motivated to work with their human and [00:34] not a dog that is more interested in [00:36] their environment another thing is going [00:38] to be a dog that is comfortable and [00:40] confident in multiple environments so we [00:44] don't want a dog that's going to be [00:45] skittish when they're out in public we [00:47] want a dog that's going to be able to [00:48] become generalized to the training so [00:50] they're obedient in multiple [00:52] environments but also that they're able [00:54] to do the service dog tasks that are [00:56] required of them in these different [00:57] environments so again it comes down to [01:00] working with the dogs seeing if they're [01:01] capable of these tasks a big part of it [01:04] is going to be perseverance [01:06] hey how are you guys i'm seeing some of [01:07] the comments coming through thank you [01:09] very much [01:10] so again that's what it's going to be [01:12] for the service dog it's really [01:13] something that when we're working with [01:15] the dog we can kind of tell whether or [01:16] not that dog has what it takes of course [01:18] being friendly with people not being [01:20] overly interested in other dogs and [01:22] people but again being more focused on [01:24] the person that they're providing their [01:25] services for and something that's very [01:28] important to understand when it comes to [01:29] service dogs this is a common issue that [01:32] we run into when we're training service [01:33] dogs or if somebody has a service dog [01:36] and that's when people come up and they [01:38] want to pet the service dog now [01:40] people don't understand why [01:42] we tell others not to pet the dog when [01:45] they're working and the main reason is [01:47] we need the dog to be focused on the [01:49] human that they are working with we [01:52] don't want them be being focused on [01:54] everything else in the environment it's [01:55] actually one of the reasons why i tell [01:57] people not to allow their dog to say hi [02:00] to other dogs when they're on a walk [02:02] anytime i take a dog on a walk that [02:05] dog's responsibility is the walk it's [02:07] not an opportunity to go out and say hi [02:09] to every dog and hi to every single [02:11] person that they see [02:12] they should just be elements within the [02:14] environment the dogs aware that they're [02:16] there but they know that it's not [02:19] something that they're going to interact [02:20] with if you have a dog and every time [02:22] you take them out on a walk and when you [02:23] see the neighbor's dog with their dog [02:25] you want to walk up and say hi and let [02:27] every single person say hi [02:29] then when you're out and about your [02:31] dog's going to be looking around to get [02:32] attention is that dog going to play with [02:34] me is this person going to say hi to me [02:36] and now these are going to be additional [02:38] distractions that's going to make it [02:39] significantly harder when you're working [02:41] with your dog another question that i [02:44] had recently is my dog is very reactive [02:47] to [02:49] people and other dogs when on a walk uh [02:52] how can we get our dogs to be calmer in [02:53] public okay this is something that i'm [02:55] actually kind of be uh addressing right [02:57] now with this question so a dog being [02:59] reactive on a walk not reactive as far [03:02] as being aggressive but being overly [03:04] excited to meet new people or meet other [03:07] dogs [03:08] when we're working with a behavior that [03:10] this is why it's very important to [03:12] understand the science of dog training [03:14] it's something that i talk about on a [03:16] lot of my videos if we can understand [03:18] the science then we can master the art [03:21] now the art is being able to separate [03:23] what's different between each dog like [03:26] how much perseverance does this dog have [03:28] how intelligent is this dog what [03:30] motivates this dog i'll give you a quick [03:32] example [03:34] one dog if you spray them with a water [03:35] hose they could see that as positive [03:37] reinforcement they enjoyed being sprayed [03:39] with a water hose where another dog if [03:41] you spray them with a water hose they're [03:43] not going to like it so for that dog [03:44] it's going to be positive punishment and [03:47] this is why we have to adjust according [03:49] to each dog that we're working with the [03:51] science is always the same so first when [03:54] i'm working with a dog let's say i'm [03:56] going to take this dog and i'm going to [03:57] enter it into a stay and train program [03:58] where i'm going to start working with [04:00] the dog the first thing i want to do and [04:02] of course this is what i do with any dog [04:04] that i'm working with it doesn't matter [04:05] if it's search and rescue basic [04:07] obedience competition obedience or our [04:10] family pet we want to start with those [04:12] communication channels because that's is [04:14] what's going to give us the ability to [04:16] clearly communicate with our dogs in a [04:18] timely manner when they're right and [04:20] wrong it's known as engagement training [04:22] or loading the markers that's the first [04:24] thing that we're going to want to do [04:26] we're going to want to make sure our [04:27] dog's conditioned to these markers now [04:29] there's two that i use that predict [04:30] positive reinforcement it's known as a [04:32] continuation marker and a terminal [04:34] marker i'm not going to go too much into [04:36] detail on this because i do have [04:38] multiple videos covering this specific [04:40] subject but once we get our dog [04:41] condition into these markers then we [04:43] want to start teaching them the concept [04:45] of luring now lauren's important because [04:47] it leads us to our next step which is [04:49] teaching a dog the concept of leash [04:51] pressure now leash pressure should [04:53] really be called a leash cue because [04:55] once the dog is trained on it it's not [04:57] pressure but rather a signal to let the [05:00] dog know that they need to do something [05:01] and this is when we're implementing [05:03] negative reinforcement again don't get [05:05] confused by the terminology because [05:07] people often think that negative [05:09] reinforcement is some kind of punishment [05:12] negative reinforcement when we turn [05:14] pressure on once they comply we turn the [05:16] pressure off that's the negative again [05:18] an easy way to remember this is negative [05:20] means removing something from the [05:21] equation positive means adding something [05:24] to the equation [05:25] punishment means preventing a behavior [05:27] from being repeated reinforcement means [05:30] encouraging a behavior to be repeated so [05:33] when we're using negative reinforcement [05:35] two very important things must take [05:36] place once the pressure is turned on it [05:38] cannot be turned off until they comply [05:41] and the moment they comply it has to [05:43] instantly be turned off [05:44] often when i'm doing in-person lessons [05:47] when we're going over leash pressure i [05:49] find myself saying at least once turn [05:52] the pressure off turn the pressure off [05:53] turn the pressure off turn the pressure [05:54] off because the moment the dog gets into [05:57] the position we have to instantly turn [05:59] off the pressure when i'm teaching the [06:00] dog leash pressure my number one focus [06:03] is that pressure i have to make sure [06:05] that once i turn it on i don't turn it [06:06] off until they comply and the moment [06:08] they comply boom i instantly turn it off [06:11] look at leash pressure like a problem [06:13] we're presenting a problem to our dog [06:16] and then what we want to do to [06:18] remove the stress that could be [06:19] associated with the training is by [06:21] giving the dog the answer this is [06:23] something i started [06:25] talking about more in my videos because [06:26] i think it's a really good analogy to [06:28] understand this concept for example when [06:30] we ask our dogs to perform a command if [06:32] we give them a verbal command what we're [06:35] really doing is we're asking them a [06:36] question we're saying do you know what [06:39] to do when i tell you sit or do you know [06:41] what to do when i tell you down and the [06:43] dog gives us that blank look no i don't [06:45] know what to do or they might give us [06:46] the wrong answer they down when we tell [06:48] them to sit or they spin when we tell [06:50] them to stand that's because they're not [06:52] a hundred percent sure on the answer yet [06:54] so when we're teaching them a command [06:56] look at it as a question and then we [06:58] provide them with the answer and we do [07:00] this enough times up until one day we [07:02] ask them the question they go boom i [07:04] know the answer and they jump into the [07:06] position [07:07] same thing with leash pressure we turn [07:09] pressure on and that's a problem we are [07:11] presenting a problem to our dogs if we [07:13] don't give them the answer then they're [07:15] going to start to cycle through [07:17] different solutions or different [07:19] possible solutions or answers to the [07:21] problem they might bite at the leash [07:23] they might just resist that classical [07:25] opposition reflex they might roll on the [07:27] ground this is why we give them the [07:30] answer we turn on the pressure and then [07:32] we use the food lure to guide them into [07:34] the position so present the problem [07:36] deliver the solution present the problem [07:38] deliver the solution and we do this [07:40] again as many times as it takes [07:43] up until the point where the dog goes [07:46] with the pressure they give us the [07:47] answer so what i'm going to do right now [07:49] i actually have my computer up on the [07:51] other side so i can't see i'm filming on [07:54] my phone so a lot of the questions [07:57] after they pop up [07:58] they go away so i'm gonna pull this up [08:01] over here so i can see some of the [08:02] questions without them disappearing on [08:04] me [08:05] okay [08:07] someone added something negative means [08:08] removing yes but you add pressure before [08:11] removing it so why isn't it positive [08:13] negative reinforcement assumes the [08:14] pressure has always been there but you [08:17] add it can you please explain thank you [08:19] okay yeah so [08:20] negative reinforcement that's the [08:22] terminology behind it so for example if [08:25] you're gonna push your dog into a sit [08:27] you apply pressure on their rear end and [08:30] then the moment the dog sits you remove [08:32] your hand that would be another form of [08:34] negative reinforcement we are turning [08:37] pressure on but positive reinforcement [08:40] is giving the dog something so they want [08:42] us to remove the pressure [08:44] that's what's reinforcing the behavior [08:46] the dog wants the treat so we hand it to [08:49] them that's what's reinforcing the [08:50] behavior we're giving them something [08:52] that they want we're removing something [08:55] that may be some slightly uh [08:57] uncomfortable [08:58] so again if we're doing leash pressure [09:00] training correctly it shouldn't be seen [09:03] as something that is stressful now i'm [09:05] explaining all this because when i take [09:07] a dog on a walk i want to make sure i [09:10] have all of this established i don't [09:12] want to go on a walk and the dog doesn't [09:14] know markers they don't know luring and [09:15] they don't know leash pressure now i'm [09:17] not going to be able to communicate with [09:19] them remember dog training is being able [09:21] to communicate with our dogs in a timely [09:23] manner when they're right and wrong and [09:25] giving them a clear path to success so i [09:28] take the dog on the walk i also want to [09:30] make sure that my dog understands a stay [09:33] so there is a long process to this but [09:36] if we do it correctly it goes [09:38] very very quickly [09:40] once i have the dog understanding those [09:42] first three steps then i want to make [09:44] sure that the dog understands the basics [09:46] of a stay because if we're taking our [09:48] dog on a walk they're on a heel stay or [09:51] a loose leash walking stay now it's a [09:53] mobile stay but it's still a stay [09:56] when we teach our dogs to stay we want [09:58] to start on the stay that is the easiest [10:00] for them with the least amount of [10:02] distractions this is the same when we're [10:04] working on obedience i have a video on [10:06] this uh it's socializing i forget the [10:09] title but it's socializing our dogs but [10:11] also working on obedience in multiple [10:13] environments getting them generalized to [10:15] the training [10:17] so the generalization someone wrote fix [10:20] that oh okay i'll look at that once i'm [10:22] done with this [10:23] so [10:24] when we're getting a dog generalized to [10:25] the training that means that they can [10:27] perform the obedience in all kinds of [10:29] different environments they can perform [10:31] the obedience at home at the park if [10:33] they're at the veterinarian clinic going [10:35] into the vehicle it doesn't matter they [10:37] perform it in every location when we're [10:39] doing this we want to start an [10:41] environment with the least amount of [10:42] distractions possible the most ideal [10:45] training room to start a young puppy in [10:47] is a completely empty room no [10:49] distractions so we have the dog and the [10:52] only thing that they're interested in [10:53] focusing in on is us because we're the [10:55] only interesting thing in the room [10:58] once they become proficient at that then [11:00] we start adding new environments now [11:02] it's the same with our stay what i mean [11:04] by that is i like to start a stay on the [11:08] easiest stay that there is and for me [11:10] it's the climb command [11:12] excuse me some people called the place [11:13] command it's just an elevated position [11:16] and the reason why i like to start on [11:18] this and the reason why it's the easiest [11:20] is because when a dog breaks the stay [11:23] and we place them back it's very clear [11:25] to them that's where we want them to be [11:28] now this is also important to understand [11:30] why we have two different markers when [11:32] the dog does something incorrect [11:35] we don't want to start now [11:37] let me take a step back [11:39] if i have a marker that lets the dog [11:41] know they're going to receive a [11:42] correction that's known as a condition [11:44] correction correction not correction a [11:46] condition correction just like if we [11:48] have a marker that predicts a reward [11:51] that's a condition reinforcer because [11:54] it's been conditioned to be reinforcing [11:56] a marker that predicts a correction has [11:57] been conditioned to be a correction [11:59] therefore it's a conditioned correction [12:02] but we also have a marker that predicts [12:04] negative reinforcement now the big [12:06] difference between the two if i'm [12:08] teaching a dog something and they make a [12:10] mistake [12:11] if they don't know the rules yet then [12:13] you don't want to correct them because [12:15] it can make our dogs become as one of my [12:18] favorite dog trainers michael ellis says [12:20] it can make them become careful if we [12:23] correct a dog too early or if we correct [12:25] them for mistakes they become cautious [12:27] and of course that's not what we want we [12:29] want confident dogs that know how to [12:31] navigate properly within our world so [12:34] when a dog is learning something if they [12:36] don't know it yet then we want to use [12:38] negative reinforcement and again if we [12:40] taught leash pressure correctly then [12:42] it's not going to be seen as a [12:44] punishment so let's use this day as an [12:46] example we have the dog on stay the [12:49] moment the dog breaks the stay i like to [12:52] use the marker that predicts negative [12:54] reinforcement i use the word wrong [12:57] dogs don't have dictionaries you can use [12:59] whatever word you like you can say blue [13:02] could be your marker for negative [13:04] reinforcement it could be uh-uh it could [13:07] be incorrect it could be whatever you [13:08] want it to be as long as you're [13:10] consistent with that sound so the dog [13:13] breaks i say wrong they know that when i [13:15] say wrong i'm going to take the leash [13:18] and i'm going to place them back on the [13:19] position they just broke now i can use [13:22] this in multiple different situations [13:24] let's say you have a new baby you have [13:26] the baby's room you don't want the dog [13:28] going into the baby's room the moment [13:30] the dog steps into that room you would [13:32] say wrong use the leash and guide the [13:34] dog out of the room the dog tries going [13:36] out the front door before giving [13:38] permission when stepping out on a walk [13:40] the moment the dog goes out the front [13:41] door you would say wrong you use a leash [13:43] to guide them back the dog jumps up on [13:45] somebody you say wrong you use a leash [13:48] to pull the dog off so now the dog is [13:50] starting to understand that wrong means [13:52] stop what you're doing or go back to the [13:54] previous position [13:55] once i have the dog staying on the climb [13:58] stay and they're successful in that [13:59] position now i'm going to work some of [14:01] the other stays i'm going to do my sit [14:03] stay my down stay [14:05] maybe center stay center is actually [14:07] pretty easy to keep the dog in the [14:09] center position and that could also [14:11] start teaching them the concept of being [14:13] in a mobile state maintaining a position [14:16] whether or not we're moving because it's [14:18] a position now once i have all that [14:20] established now i can take the dog on [14:22] the walk and i can reinforce the heel [14:25] stay also when i go on a walk with a dog [14:27] i don't just walk i like to incorporate [14:29] obedience throughout the work now or [14:32] throughout the walk now i'm not doing [14:34] all kinds of different commands i'm [14:35] keeping it relatively simple i'm doing [14:37] automatic sits when halted verbal sits [14:40] verbal down verbal come when called [14:43] sometimes i'll bring him into the heel [14:44] position and the heel position that's [14:47] pretty much it but if you're on a walk [14:49] and you're incorporating this obedience [14:51] it makes your dog stay more aware to you [14:55] now if you just take a dog out and the [14:56] dog just walks in front of you they're [14:58] pulling on the leash they're doing [15:00] whatever they want and the only thing [15:01] that the leash is doing is preventing [15:03] the dog from running off now you're [15:05] going to run into issues because now the [15:07] dog has the ability to focus on the [15:09] squirrels focus on the neighbor's dog [15:11] focus on the person cutting their front [15:13] grass focus on the mailman as they drive [15:15] by [15:16] now these are going to be added [15:17] distractions but if your dog has to pay [15:19] to pay attention to staying in the heel [15:21] command and your dog has to maintain [15:24] focus or [15:25] pay attention whether or not you're [15:26] going to give them a random sit or down [15:28] command now that's going to be the [15:30] primary focus [15:32] if i have a dog [15:34] i know this is a long answer to one [15:36] question but there's a lot to it if i [15:38] have a dog now being reactive to other [15:39] dogs i want to use that concept of [15:42] counter conditioning and desensitization [15:44] that's where we are introducing the dog [15:46] to whatever stimuli is getting them [15:48] overly excited or fearful it works for [15:50] fear works for aggression as well we [15:52] introduce it at a very low level [15:54] gradually increase it as the dog becomes [15:57] more confident and incorporating [15:59] obedience so by exposing them to it over [16:02] and over again it's no longer a big deal [16:04] it's not something that is going to be [16:06] super exciting because they see it every [16:08] day it's become a part of their normal [16:10] routine [16:11] a great place to do this is the local [16:13] dog park now you don't want to go into [16:15] the dog park you stay outside of the dog [16:17] park and you first [16:20] this goes back to the video i was [16:21] talking about earlier with socializing [16:23] and getting our dogs generalized to the [16:25] training you want to stay outside of the [16:27] dog park and you want to be far enough [16:29] away that you're not getting a bad [16:31] reaction from your dog if you're too [16:33] close and your dog's reacting well [16:35] you're too close to the stimuli you have [16:37] to back up and then we're going to [16:38] slowly work towards getting the dog more [16:42] confident and more comfortable another [16:44] thing that i like to do if a dog is [16:46] acting up on a walk or let's say [16:47] somebody's walking by i take the dog off [16:50] to the side i put them in a sit command [16:52] and then if i need to i reinforce with [16:55] leash pressure if we look at things in [16:57] the concept of obedience if we always [17:00] tell our dogs what we want them to do [17:02] then when they're not doing what we want [17:04] we can simply reinforce those [17:06] expectations by using the leash pressure [17:09] or if they know the rules then we can [17:11] use corrections for reliability i do [17:13] have a video that [17:15] the the thumbnail says if this then that [17:17] but it has my behavioral and [17:19] modification flow chart it's a [17:21] step-by-step process to identify what is [17:23] the issue and then what do we have to do [17:25] in order to fix it and if you follow [17:27] those steps then you can get results and [17:30] if you're having issues it's be it's not [17:33] because of the science but rather [17:35] being able to adjust to the dog that [17:37] you're working with okay let's see some [17:40] other questions a lot are coming through [17:42] thanks for you know putting down all [17:43] these comments and watching we have a [17:44] good amount of people watching right now [17:46] this is excellent [17:48] let's see [17:50] so getting the dog to be calmer in [17:52] public [17:53] yes it does become easier as they get [17:55] older so if you have a young puppy it's [17:57] going to be more difficult it's like [17:58] doing those puppy classes i actually [18:01] recommend for people to go to group [18:02] puppy classes but not to really learn or [18:05] do obedience because it's [18:07] it's way too difficult for puppies but [18:08] rather to get them exposure and have [18:11] them around other dogs part of [18:13] socializing it's really good [18:16] okay how effective is the flirt pull and [18:19] drag lures for protection [18:21] training [18:23] okay [18:25] martingale collar is used for guide dogs [18:27] global not sure what the issue is in [18:29] general [18:30] i mean i like martingale collars i'm not [18:31] sure what the question is there but [18:33] flirt poles are excellent when i'm [18:35] working a dog for protection which i [18:37] used to do protection way more [18:40] a few years back i don't do it as often [18:43] now [18:44] especially for the guys in the bite suit [18:45] i was talking to a good friend of mine [18:47] spencer bowman last week on the podcast [18:50] he is a protection specialist the guy is [18:53] phenomenal in the bite suit and when [18:55] you're in the bite suit and you're [18:56] working these highly trained protection [18:58] dogs it can be pretty dangerous but [19:01] flirt poles i i do like to start with a [19:04] puppy in the beginning if i'm going to [19:05] do protection training with them by [19:08] doing what tom rose calls drive building [19:11] and the process for drive building is [19:13] you take the dog you put on a harness or [19:15] a martingale collar this gives the dog [19:17] the ability to pull you want to build [19:19] that frustration i do a small example of [19:22] it in my video on how to teach a dog to [19:24] bark with sergio and harley [19:27] so you want to create frustration we put [19:30] the dog on a back tie we put on the [19:31] harness or the agitation collar so they [19:33] can pull and then we start to tease them [19:36] now i like a flirt pull because it gives [19:38] me a little bit more distance if you [19:39] don't know what a flirt pole is it's [19:41] just a pole that has a [19:43] rope attached to it with a toy so you [19:45] can move the toy around sometimes it has [19:47] a basic toy i like the ones that have [19:50] like tug toys attached to it or puppy [19:52] tug toys and then we move it back and [19:54] forth to get the dog excited we're using [19:57] that prey drive as well as that play [19:59] drive and the frustration once the dog [20:02] barks or they show excitement then i [20:04] move i respond to the bark what i used [20:07] to tell people that i was working with [20:09] students at the tom rose school i would [20:11] say imagine that these dogs are like [20:14] the cartoon disney character bolt and [20:17] they all have a super bark and when the [20:19] dog barks at you respond as if you're [20:23] being hit with the dog's bark so a dog [20:26] would bark boom oh whoa and the dog [20:28] would see that and that would get them [20:29] even more excited and more amped up and [20:31] they bark again and we move again they [20:33] bark we move they bark we move up until [20:35] the point where i give the dog the bite [20:37] now once they bite it i swing the toy [20:39] around they bite it then i instantly [20:41] pull to get them to hold on nice and [20:43] tight then as i walk my way towards the [20:46] actual toy that's in the dog's mouth [20:48] because at this point i want to get the [20:50] dog to do what's known as a re-bite we [20:52] want them to have a full bite so this is [20:54] a shallow bite [20:56] when the dog has a full bite [20:58] that would be a full bite now we can get [21:01] the dog or the puppy to do that so what [21:03] i would do is i look away as i come in [21:05] the reason for that is too much frontal [21:08] body language too much eye contact on a [21:10] puppy that's too much pressure it's why [21:12] i always find it funny when people [21:14] instinctively go up to dogs and they [21:16] stand over them and they look big and [21:18] they're like hi puppy and then they end [21:20] up getting bit i don't know if any of [21:22] you have seen it but there's a video [21:23] it's an older video [21:25] of a german shepherd police dog where [21:28] the person interviewing [21:30] the police officer gets really close to [21:33] the german shepherd he's hovering over [21:35] the dog and when he steps in the dog [21:37] bites him right in the face and if you [21:39] own a dog [21:41] all you have to do is own a dog and you [21:42] can identify it right away it makes you [21:44] cringe you're like oh he's going to get [21:45] bit he's going to get bit he's got he [21:46] got bit [21:47] and the news report says everyone was [21:50] shocked [21:50] if you own a dog and you're watching [21:52] this pull the video up you won't be [21:53] surprised that he gets bit it's so [21:55] obvious but it's too much pressure so [21:58] when i come in i look away i keep [22:00] pressure on the toy so the dog doesn't [22:02] let go of it once i get to the dog i [22:04] grab the toy and i pull [22:07] not hard enough to pull it out of the [22:08] dog's mouth just enough to make the dog [22:10] hold on tightly [22:12] then when i'm ready i loosen the [22:14] pressure and the dog will naturally [22:16] re-bite so i'm pulling the dog's like i [22:19] gotta hold on to this toy i gotta hold [22:20] on to this toy then i go loose boom the [22:22] dog re-bites once they re-bite i pull [22:25] again to make sure it's nice and tight [22:26] and i keep the toy active so it's [22:28] teaching the dog to hold it it's making [22:31] the game fun [22:32] what you don't want to do is get the dog [22:34] to bite the toy and then stop playing [22:36] now it's not fun anymore i've had people [22:38] send me videos they go i don't [22:40] understand i can get my dog to bite the [22:41] toy once my dog bites the toy [22:44] i release it and then he just lets go [22:45] the toys because yeah at that point it [22:47] became boring so now the dog has the toy [22:50] we want to keep them engaged [22:52] so uh just to answer that question i [22:54] don't need to go too much into [22:56] protection training but yeah flirt pulls [22:57] are great [22:58] let's see what other questions we have [23:02] uh how do you do how do you build [23:03] confidence on a skittish dog so [23:06] confidence building [23:07] is basically putting our dogs or our [23:11] puppies in new situations and making it [23:14] a positive experience for them [23:17] if you notice that something is too [23:19] difficult the dog is fearful or skittish [23:23] then you want to present whatever it is [23:25] that they're afraid of but you want to [23:27] do it again in a manner that's not too [23:30] intense for that dog i'll give you an [23:32] example vacuum cleaners that's something [23:34] that a lot of dogs are afraid of or they [23:37] respond in a bad way if i have a dog [23:39] that is responding poorly to a vacuum [23:41] cleaner then what i do is [23:44] i take the vacuum i take it apart at [23:47] least as much as you're able to take it [23:49] apart and i introduce one item at a time [23:51] to the dog and i give them a reward so [23:53] they see the bottom half of the vacuum [23:55] cleaner i give them a reward they see [23:56] the top half the bag or whatever type of [23:58] vacuum cleaner that you're using now [24:00] they see the entire thing put together [24:03] now i might move it mark and reward move [24:05] it again mark and reward without the [24:07] vacuum being turned on now i might turn [24:09] it on and then turn it off and reward [24:11] turn on off reward so we're getting them [24:14] more confident by having it be [24:16] associated to something that the dog [24:18] enjoys in this case [24:20] positive reinforcement we're using a [24:23] treat [24:24] uh spencer and i talked about this last [24:26] week with gunfire and this is something [24:28] that he said that i hadn't done before [24:31] and i really like the idea for the dogs [24:33] when he's teaching them to get used to [24:35] gunfire he does an escape bite so the [24:38] decoy runs away [24:39] fires the pistol as the dog goes in so [24:42] they're using that prey drive to build [24:43] the dog's confidence the way i used to [24:46] do it was we would have the gunfire go [24:48] off far away from the dog to where it [24:50] wasn't close enough it would cause any [24:52] sort of discomfort or distraction to the [24:54] dog while they're training and then over [24:56] time we would bring the gunfire closer [24:58] and closer up until the point where the [25:00] dog has been completely desensitized to [25:03] it and it's not a big deal anymore so [25:05] confidence building and counter [25:06] conditioning they're very similar the [25:09] main difference with [25:11] counter conditioning is the fact that [25:13] the dog is already afraid of something [25:15] whereas with [25:17] confidence building we are exposing the [25:19] dog to new things and we're trying to [25:22] make it as positive of an experience as [25:24] possible [25:25] for let's use aria as an example when [25:28] she was a puppy i would take her to the [25:30] local playground i would play with her i [25:32] would let her chase me i always like [25:34] taking a kiddie pool and filling it with [25:37] plastic bottles or those balls that you [25:40] can order [25:41] the same balls that they use at kids [25:43] parks like chuck e cheese and things [25:45] like that i don't know exactly what [25:46] they're called but the little plastic [25:47] balls you can fill that inside of the [25:50] kiddie pool as well and just having the [25:52] dog jump through it now they're [25:53] associating these different sounds and [25:55] noises with fun they're having a good [25:57] time they're playing you're playing tug [25:59] with them or whatever game your dog [26:01] likes likes so it's about getting our [26:03] dog exposed to all kinds of different [26:05] things and making it as pleasant as [26:08] possible i had a student once that had [26:10] her dog walking on bubble wrap i thought [26:12] that was a great idea i started to [26:14] incorporate that as well just luring the [26:16] dog over bubble wrap and rewarding the [26:18] dog while the dog was walking over the [26:20] bubble wrap so something as simple as [26:21] having your dog walking on different [26:23] surfaces [26:24] simply being in different environments [26:27] all these things are going to increase [26:29] our dog's confidence another thing that [26:31] i like to do when i play tug with a dog [26:33] i talk about this in my tug video i [26:35] always let dogs win when it comes to tug [26:38] i never win i never i never want to show [26:40] a dog oh look how big and strong i am i [26:42] can rip the tug away from you i'm the [26:44] alpha no it's all about showing them how [26:47] big and how powerful they are if the dog [26:50] bites and re-bites and pushes into me i [26:52] push i fall back a little bit like whoa [26:54] look what you just did or the dog shakes [26:57] the toy i'll throw myself across the [26:59] room it feels really silly but the look [27:02] on the dog's face when they think that [27:05] they threw you across the room by [27:06] shaking their toy [27:08] absolutely prices priceless i mean i [27:10] loved it with ari when she was a puppy i [27:12] played tug with her every day and every [27:14] time she shook the toy i would fly [27:16] across the room and she would stand [27:18] there like a super dog looking at me [27:21] thinking to herself did i just do that [27:23] so that's a big part of confidence [27:25] building [27:26] let's see i want to get through some [27:28] more question questions [27:30] do you know of any good service dog [27:32] trainers i have a standard poodle that [27:34] is in training to be my service dog he [27:36] is starting uh obedience classes this [27:38] week there are a lot of trainers out [27:40] there that will do service dog training [27:43] most professional dog trainers that do [27:45] service dog training they do that on top [27:47] of all their other [27:49] clients all their other uh [27:51] responsibilities that they have so a lot [27:54] of service dog trainers they're also [27:55] doing pet dogs they have stay in trains [27:57] they do private lessons they're dog [27:59] trainers that just do service dog [28:00] training as well most people can train a [28:03] service dog if you have the right dog [28:05] and you're willing to commit the time [28:07] that it takes to train the dog [28:09] service dog training really isn't that [28:11] difficult once you know what to do and [28:13] again it's really about putting in the [28:14] time that's why if you are trying to [28:17] fill out an application on a service dog [28:20] website to get a service dog the wait is [28:23] usually around three to five years give [28:25] or take and it's just because of the [28:27] fact that training a service dog takes a [28:29] long time and it takes a lot of [28:30] commitment because you have to do that [28:32] training as far as getting the dog [28:33] exposed in multiple environments you [28:35] have to make sure the dog is confident [28:37] you have to make sure that the dog [28:39] understands the service dog tasks [28:41] especially when you're doing service dog [28:43] training and the dog has to respond to a [28:46] involuntary natural [28:49] behavior that the person with the [28:51] disability [28:52] may demonstrate if they're having an [28:54] issue like a seizure alert dog so the [28:56] dog has to be able to do these behaviors [28:58] without commands [28:59] and that can take a good amount of time [29:01] but if you have the time to commit to it [29:04] most people can train their own service [29:06] dog again if you have the right dog and [29:08] you have of course you know either [29:10] somebody to help you with the training [29:11] that can give you guidance or you know [29:14] videos or whatever but again to answer [29:16] that question a lot of dog trainers do [29:18] offer service dog help and most [29:20] professional dog trainers can train [29:22] service dogs [29:25] okay let's see [29:30] uh getting a german shepherd puppy in [29:32] about seven weeks working on fencing in [29:34] my yard anything special i should look [29:36] out for [29:37] as long as there's nothing dangerous in [29:38] the yard you should be fine [29:40] if you have anything like a thorn bush [29:43] or something like that [29:44] you want to remove that you don't want [29:47] your dog getting a thorn or if you have [29:49] any cactuses in your yard you want to [29:51] get that out of there as well you may [29:53] not think it would happen but if you [29:54] have a dog german shepherds for example [29:57] most of them will have really high toy [29:59] drive if one of their toys goes flying [30:01] into the the cactus [30:03] they're not going to stop they're going [30:04] to run right into it and now you're [30:06] going to be having to deal with that in [30:08] fact my dog ari [30:10] back in [30:13] 2017 i believe it was [30:15] i was [30:17] outside playing fetch with all the dogs [30:20] this was in the desert so they have i [30:21] don't know what the plant is called but [30:24] they have really sharp tips [30:26] and the ball flew into this plant and [30:28] ari ran into it grabbed the ball and she [30:30] just kept running around playing like [30:32] nothing happened [30:33] then she jumped up at me i allow her to [30:36] jump up at me so she jumped up at me [30:38] with her toy because she wanted me to [30:39] play tug and i looked down at her and i [30:41] could see the sun was hitting her [30:43] directly in her eye and i could see the [30:46] thorn in her eye [30:48] of course [30:49] my heart dropped right at that moment [30:51] you don't want to see a thorn in your [30:53] dog's eyeball [30:54] so i took her to the um [30:58] emergency vet clinic they said we can [31:00] pull the thorn out of her eye but she'll [31:03] probably lose her eye [31:05] and i said okay that sounds terrible do [31:07] we have any other options and they said [31:08] there's a specialist in los angeles [31:12] you can go down there in the morning [31:13] they're closed right now but they might [31:15] be able to help you so i went down to [31:17] this specialist the next day and luckily [31:21] through surgery and [31:23] miracles of modern technology they were [31:26] able to remove the thorn from her eye [31:28] clean her up and she can see perfectly [31:30] fine out of both eyes but at that time i [31:33] also did not have pet insurance which [31:35] that would have been great if i did a [31:37] quick plug-in for prudent pet insurance [31:40] i use them now they're excellent highly [31:42] recommend them [31:44] their information is in the description [31:46] of most of my videos but that mistake of [31:49] throwing the ball into that bush cost [31:51] five thousand dollars and of course it [31:53] cost my dog the pain and discomfort of [31:55] having that thorn in her eye [31:57] so that's not something you want so make [31:59] sure it's safe like you want to puppy [32:01] proof it so they're not going to chew on [32:02] any wires there's another good one when [32:04] i was a kid [32:06] my beagle my family the family dog the [32:08] beagle got into a wire into the backyard [32:11] chewed through it and it shocked her [32:13] face and so she had to go to the [32:15] emergency room so you don't want any [32:16] exposed wires and you don't want any [32:18] sort of [32:19] thorn bushes or anything like that [32:22] okay let's see what else we have [32:28] okay so um going back to this is another [32:30] one it's a huge issue a lot of people [32:33] run into it with the leash pulling if [32:35] you're running into leash pulling issues [32:37] or your dog being reactive remember [32:39] everything that our dogs do is based on [32:42] motivation [32:43] motivation to access something pleasant [32:45] motivation to prevent something [32:47] unpleasant or the behavior itself is fun [32:49] the good thing is as dog owners [32:52] we can determine what motivating factors [32:56] are going to influence our dog's [32:58] behavior [32:59] more often than not if i get a dog in [33:02] let's say i'm doing stay in train which [33:03] i'm currently not doing stay in train [33:05] i'm probably going to start doing it [33:07] again in the near future [33:08] but when i'm doing a staying trained dog [33:11] and their issues are pulling like i said [33:12] before i establish all the communication [33:14] channels up front i want to make sure i [33:16] can communicate clearly with the dog [33:18] then once the dog knows the rules [33:21] then we can start adding corrections [33:24] is what gets reliability [33:26] this is the best analogy that i could [33:29] come up with as far as how adding a [33:31] correction will influence the dogs [33:34] influence the dog's behavior [33:37] let's say either you have kids or you're [33:39] babysitting or whatever [33:41] and let's say the the kid did something [33:43] they weren't supposed to and you said [33:44] okay you're grounded go to your room [33:46] they're in their room they sneak out and [33:48] you say what did i tell you go back to [33:49] your room they go back to the room they [33:51] sneak out again you can say what did i [33:52] tell you go back to your room [33:54] well there's no new punishment being [33:56] added to the equation the biggest risk [33:59] is they have to go back to where they [34:00] already were so there is no risk really [34:02] of sneaking out it's the same thing with [34:04] our dogs when we first use leash [34:06] pressure so if i have a dog that goes [34:08] ahead of me on a walk and i say wrong [34:10] and i use the leash and i bring the dog [34:11] back in the heel position i go loose we [34:13] start walking good dog dog goes ahead of [34:15] me wrong i bring the dog back dog goes [34:17] ahead of me wrong i bring the dog back [34:20] same thing there's nothing new being [34:21] added to the equation all that's [34:23] happening is a dog has to come back to [34:25] where they already were now some dogs [34:27] this is enough to get them to do what [34:30] you want them to do they go okay i got [34:31] it i'll listen a lot of dogs it teaches [34:34] them the rules but it doesn't get them [34:36] to do the behavior it doesn't guarantee [34:39] that they're going to listen to us and [34:40] this is when we have to add corrections [34:43] if we want reliability if you're using a [34:46] martingale collar and i've talked about [34:47] leash pops before and i'm very careful [34:50] about how i talk about corrections [34:52] because corrections are one of those [34:53] things that [34:55] if you use corrections and you do it [34:57] correctly it can help give you a very [34:59] confident dog with reliable obedience [35:02] but if we use corrections the wrong way [35:05] then we can create more problems i [35:08] mentioned michael ellis earlier he has a [35:11] really phenomenal video on his [35:13] psychology on dog training and i highly [35:16] recommend watching it he talks about it [35:19] at one point where [35:20] if the dog [35:22] okay now i just lost my train of thought [35:24] because i started thinking about the [35:25] entire video it's about an hour long [35:27] it's a really good video [35:29] i mentioned it earlier if the dog gets [35:31] corrected okay yeah no i remember okay [35:34] all right so uh he says yeah people say [35:37] you know the dog if you use a remote [35:39] training collar the dog will look [35:40] fearful and scared and he says that's [35:43] just bad compulsion that's [35:46] using correct corrections the wrong way [35:48] if the dog doesn't know why they're [35:50] being corrected if the dog doesn't know [35:52] how to avoid a correction if the dog [35:54] doesn't know how to turn off pressure by [35:55] complying if you haven't given the dog a [35:57] clear path to success then you're going [35:59] to have a very stressed out very fearful [36:02] dog so it's not oh i used a remote [36:05] collar so my dog's fearful it's no i use [36:08] corrections incorrectly so if you're [36:11] going to use corrections you have to do [36:13] it the right way and that's why there's [36:14] a very [36:15] uh strict process that you want to [36:18] follow i talk about it in the video with [36:20] the behavioral modification flow chart [36:23] if i'm going to correct a dog for [36:24] obedience first i want to make sure they [36:27] know the command i'm asking them to [36:29] perform so in this situation the dog has [36:32] to know a heel how do i know the dog [36:34] knows the heel well when i give them the [36:35] verbal command they do the behavior that [36:37] i asked them to do then they have to [36:39] know the stay for that command how do i [36:42] know the dog knows the stay well when [36:44] the dog goes ahead of me and i say wrong [36:47] the dog jumps back into the heel [36:48] position [36:50] now that the dog has shown me they know [36:52] the command they know how to turn off [36:54] pressure by complying [36:56] now i can add a correction to get [36:57] reliability [36:59] one of the biggest [37:01] signs that you have done your training [37:04] the right way before adding corrections [37:07] is how many corrections it takes to fix [37:10] the issue you're currently dealing with [37:12] what i mean by that is [37:14] when i am ready to start correcting a [37:16] dog for issues that they're having [37:18] if i have to continue to correct the dog [37:20] then that usually means i didn't do the [37:23] training [37:24] in the beginning [37:26] to a point where it was clear enough to [37:27] my dog to understand what the rules were [37:30] most the time when we go to add [37:32] corrections the moment we give the dog [37:34] their first correction they go oh okay [37:36] no problem i'll listen and then you [37:37] almost instantly have a dog with [37:39] reliable obedience because now you've [37:42] added a new correction or you've added a [37:44] correction and now you've made the [37:46] training real so let's go back to the [37:48] example of the kids sneaking out of [37:49] their room they sneak out of their room [37:51] and now you say okay now you don't get [37:53] to play video games [37:54] now we've added a new punishment to the [37:57] equation now they go okay it's not worth [37:59] sneaking out the other important factor [38:01] when we're adding corrections of course [38:03] we don't want to correct the dog too [38:04] hard because if we correct them too hard [38:06] that can create fear issues we don't [38:09] want to yell at our dogs if we yell at [38:11] our dogs that can create fear issues [38:15] and if the correction is not changing [38:17] the dog's behavior and you've done all [38:19] the steps correctly then more often than [38:22] not it means the correction's not high [38:24] enough for that dog it's like trying to [38:26] give a billionaire a speeding ticket [38:29] that loves to speed [38:31] if jeff bezos loves speeding i think i [38:34] said his name right if he loves to speed [38:36] and he gets pulled over and they write [38:38] on even a 350 ticket speeding ticket [38:41] that's nothing to him so [38:44] it's a great analogy to look at how [38:46] wealthy is your dog if you have a very [38:49] wealthy dog that means your correction [38:51] is going to have to be higher so the dog [38:53] has a larger bank account a lot of dog [38:55] trainers like to use that terminology so [38:57] let's say i have this dog on a [38:59] martingale collar and i do a leash pop [39:01] and that doesn't change the dog's [39:03] behavior then you would have to upgrade [39:06] essentially to either a prong collar or [39:08] a remote training collar now i plan on [39:11] putting putting together a series on the [39:13] remote training collar [39:15] i've been really hesitant as far as [39:18] doing that [39:19] because there's a lot a lot of things on [39:21] the internet that say remote collars are [39:23] terrible you should never use them it's [39:26] the worst thing you can do to your dog [39:28] is to use a remote training collar [39:30] i use remote training collars on both of [39:32] my dogs and every time i pull out the [39:35] remote training collars they become very [39:38] very excited [39:39] and they know that the remote collars [39:41] mean we're going to do something fun [39:43] there's an open field close by to where [39:45] i live i take them to that open field [39:47] every day i do a little bit of obedience [39:50] and i do chuck it fetch [39:52] every day i take them there so the [39:53] moment i pull out those collars those [39:55] collars mean we're going to have a good [39:58] time so every time they see it they they [40:00] get really excited now often when i am [40:02] teaching someone how to use a remote [40:04] training collar they say do i always [40:05] have to use it [40:07] and i say well with my dogs i always put [40:10] my remote collar on my dogs anytime [40:12] they're going to be off leash [40:14] that's the only way we can have true off [40:17] leash reliability is with a remote [40:20] training collar now they come up with [40:21] some other technology that could be [40:23] better then we can look at that in the [40:24] future but right now the best thing as [40:26] far as having off leash reliability is [40:29] going to be the remote training collar [40:30] and there's a process to teach the dog [40:32] the remote training collar [40:34] let's say for example you have a dog [40:36] that digs in your backyard you can put a [40:38] remote collar on that dog send the dog [40:40] into the backyard and you just sit and [40:42] watch [40:43] the moment the dog starts to dig you [40:46] stimulate the collar and then you get to [40:48] be the good guy you say what happened [40:50] fluffy did that dirt bite you [40:53] probably shouldn't be digging and the [40:55] dog's going to associate that correction [40:59] to the activity [41:01] where most people run into issues is [41:03] when they start using the remote [41:05] training collar [41:06] for obedience and they haven't taught [41:08] the dog [41:10] or the terminology that's used is they [41:13] haven't taught the dog to be directional [41:15] to the collar yet [41:16] meaning if you correct the dog for [41:18] obedience they know that the correction [41:20] came from you [41:22] they know it's because they did not [41:24] listen or comply to what you asked them [41:26] to do and they know how to stop that [41:28] correction from happening again [41:31] michael ellis calls this a phantom [41:34] phantom correction they don't know where [41:35] it's coming from [41:36] so what dog trainers do is when we are [41:39] teaching our dog the remote training [41:41] collar we use the leash [41:44] to give the dog direction like i said [41:46] i'm going to put together a series for [41:47] this i think it is something that is [41:49] important i think it will add a lot of [41:51] value to a lot of people will give you [41:53] the confidence to have your dog off [41:55] leash taking them on hikes taking them [41:57] camping [41:58] you can have your front door open walk [42:01] outside to get your mail not worry about [42:03] your dog running off oh and what i was [42:05] going to say every time i have my dogs [42:07] off leash they have the remote collar on [42:10] now i almost never have to use it but [42:13] for me it's a safety net [42:15] meaning if something does happen [42:18] i can stop them if for some reason let's [42:21] say this actually happened okay perfect [42:23] example [42:24] about two weeks ago i was out of the [42:26] field i was playing fetch with my dogs [42:28] and a stray dog came running up [42:31] now i called both of my dogs in the heel [42:34] charlie goes on my right side ari goes [42:36] on my left and we calmly walked back to [42:39] the vehicle as i was watching the stray [42:41] dog [42:42] it's not a good idea to see a stray dog [42:45] and to go up to them now of course we [42:48] called animal control so they can come [42:50] out and find the owner [42:52] but with something like that you don't [42:53] want to go up because you don't want to [42:54] get risk getting bit [42:56] people often think that they're a dog [42:59] whisperer because they owned a dog and [43:00] they see a stray dog on the side of the [43:02] road i know somebody that went up to a [43:04] stray dog on the side of the road and [43:06] she was bit in the face had i think over [43:08] 100 stitches so anytime you see a stray [43:11] dog always be cautious call somebody to [43:14] come out and get it don't mess with the [43:15] dog yourself even if you're a [43:17] professional there's high risk and the [43:18] person that i'm talking about that was [43:20] bit that person was a dog trainer so you [43:22] have to be careful because you don't [43:24] know where they've been you don't know [43:25] the type of dog but anyways besides the [43:26] point i called my dogs to me and we were [43:29] able to walk all the way back to the car [43:31] i kept watching the dog and nothing [43:33] happened everything was fine [43:35] let's say you have an overly friendly [43:37] dog wants to run up and say hi to [43:38] everybody but your dog is really good [43:40] off leash and you say i don't have to [43:42] worry about it my dog stays next to me [43:44] it's great but then that stray dog shows [43:47] up your dog takes off after the stray [43:49] dog and let's say that stray dog is [43:51] highly aggressive [43:52] now you're dealing with a dog fight that [43:55] could be potentially life-threatening to [43:57] your dog the dog could turn on and [43:59] attack you [44:00] dogs can kill people that has happened [44:03] so we always want to be very cautious [44:05] with any stray dog but point being is i [44:08] was able to control my dogs i had the [44:10] remote training collar and everything [44:12] was fine everyone was safe [44:14] so again there is a process to do that i [44:17] do plan on putting that together but [44:19] essentially what we're doing is we're [44:21] pairing the leash with the correction on [44:24] the remote training collar so then we're [44:26] giving the dog direction i talk about it [44:28] in my manual [44:29] let's say i'm going to give a dog a [44:30] correction and i'm using a leash pop i [44:32] would say no i popped the leash giving [44:35] the dog the correction i tell them what [44:37] i want them to do and then i help them [44:39] so i assist them when we're correcting a [44:42] dog i always look at it this way we say [44:44] our condition correction for me i use [44:45] the word no no [44:47] correction [44:48] recommand [44:49] assist [44:51] so let's say you told your dog to sit [44:52] and they decided not to sit no [44:55] correction sit and then we assist them i [44:58] say we assist them because [45:01] when you first start adding corrections [45:03] in your training some dogs it will throw [45:06] them off [45:07] and they're not going to be able to [45:08] comply because you corrected them so [45:10] let's say your dog knows that your dog [45:11] sits all the time one day you tell your [45:13] dog sit your dog doesn't sit so no [45:15] correction sit and because you corrected [45:17] your dog you'd think okay now my dog's [45:19] going to sit your dog doesn't sit so you [45:21] go no correction sit no correction sit [45:24] no cr [45:25] you don't want to do that [45:27] no one correction one mistake sit and [45:30] then we assist them so you use leash [45:32] pressure or you use a food lure you do [45:35] something to help the dog and that's how [45:37] i use any correction for obedience a dog [45:40] breaks the stay let's say i have the dog [45:42] in a down stay no correction down assist [45:47] we'll talk more about the remote [45:48] training collars in the series that's [45:50] going to be a pretty detailed series but [45:52] i think it's going to be something that [45:54] will be worthwhile and will be very [45:55] beneficial to people [45:58] okay uh someone said i just finished [46:01] your audiobook oh the audiobook by the [46:03] way on my [46:04] youtube channel that's version one [46:07] the current manual is version three [46:10] so i i've added a good amount of content [46:13] which e-collar would i recommend i like [46:15] dogtra and i like e-collar technology [46:18] they're both great they both have really [46:20] nice reliable collars i personally [46:23] really like the dogtra arc that's the [46:25] one that i have for my dogs it works [46:28] great [46:28] the hands free so it also comes with a [46:30] little button you can put on your hand [46:32] so you don't have to hold the remote [46:34] all right let's see [46:40] okay someone has a very food motivated [46:42] dog food motivated dogs are great [46:47] okay what's the best way to use positive [46:49] punishment for a nine week old puppy so [46:52] with nine week old puppies you can use [46:55] positive punishment [46:57] i usually try not to for most things the [47:00] only thing that i use [47:02] positive punishment on a puppy is going [47:05] to be for going to the bathroom inside [47:08] the house [47:09] and doing destructive or dangerous [47:12] behaviors and for me it's a leash pop on [47:15] a martingale collar a light leash pop [47:17] not very hard and also like i said [47:20] earlier in the video when we are adding [47:22] corrections make sure you are not [47:25] yelling [47:26] corrections should not be seen as [47:28] something that's personal it's cause and [47:30] effect the puppy bites the furniture no [47:34] correction the puppy stops biting the [47:36] furniture good nice job buddy excellent [47:39] very good so they don't see anything as [47:42] bad it's they just get a correction [47:43] they're like huh what oh i'm a good [47:45] puppy okay great and we're telling them [47:48] good puppy when they stop doing the [47:50] behavior of course you wouldn't want to [47:51] tell them good puppy while they're [47:53] chewing on the furniture because that's [47:54] going to have the opposite effect [47:56] this is something i talked about in my [47:57] how to stop a puppy from biting video if [48:00] they're biting on your arm now i usually [48:03] don't correct puppies for biting [48:05] it goes away most of the time if they [48:08] enjoy biting it can continue beyond that [48:12] uh teething period at six months like [48:15] ari will run around she'll jump up and [48:17] she'll play bite my arm i've been doing [48:19] it with her since she was a puppy it's [48:20] part of the game and she doesn't bite [48:22] hard at all like we were doing it the [48:23] other day there's nothing on my arm she [48:25] has really good bite restriction and [48:27] it's something we've always been doing [48:28] if it's not something that you like then [48:30] it is good to correct right away so the [48:32] moment that the puppy bites no [48:35] pop on the leash [48:36] we start at very low corrections and we [48:39] increase as needed for each dog so you [48:42] don't want to correct too hard [48:45] what if uh aggressive bite from a 10 [48:47] week old puppy [48:48] most of the time puppies are not going [48:51] to be biting aggressively the only time [48:54] i've seen that with a puppy has been [48:56] resource guarding so a young puppy [48:59] resource guarding food or research [49:02] resource guarding a toy and if that [49:04] happens what i do [49:06] is i like to do what's known as the [49:08] superman technique [49:10] the superman technique let's say i have [49:12] a dog that resource guards food and it's [49:16] a puppy i would reach my hand into the [49:19] dog's bowl where they have their food [49:20] and i would let the puppy bite me and i [49:23] would just sit there and ignore it not a [49:25] big deal it's a puppy once they stop [49:27] biting then i remove my hand so i'm [49:30] showing them that the aggression doesn't [49:32] work [49:33] now if you have a young puppy that is [49:36] resource guarding and you go to grab [49:39] whatever it is that they have and they [49:40] bite at you and you pull back [49:42] then that's going to make the issue even [49:45] worse because you have just shown the [49:47] puppy that the aggressive behavior is [49:50] going to deliver the desired results so [49:54] by doing the superman technique i just [49:56] keep my hand there the puppy bites me [49:58] once they stop biting me [49:59] then i take my hand away so they go oh [50:02] well first of all you're not trying to [50:04] take my food [50:05] second of all biting didn't get your [50:07] hand to go away [50:09] and the most important factor is once [50:11] they stop biting that's when we remove [50:14] our hand so often when a dog wants [50:17] something we show them how to get what [50:19] they want by doing what we want and in [50:22] this situation it was not being [50:24] aggressive [50:26] once the dog was acting out that [50:27] behavior good dog my hand goes away and [50:30] then i can practice doing that i did a [50:31] video with my friend bethany another [50:34] excellent dog trainer [50:36] and it's a technique that works really [50:38] well if you have a dog that has issues [50:40] with resource guarding while they're [50:41] eating or while they have their toy you [50:44] slowly bring your hand towards them with [50:47] something of added value so another [50:49] piece of food so that way when the hand [50:51] is coming towards them they're not [50:53] worried about you taking away what they [50:56] currently have but rather you're adding [50:58] to whatever it is that they have so now [51:01] they see your hand as value this is one [51:03] of the reasons why i also recommend not [51:06] to use your hand as a correction to the [51:09] dog so knife handing dogs or heel [51:12] kicking dogs that's bad because we don't [51:15] want our body parts to be seen as [51:17] something that is potentially dangerous [51:20] to our dogs anytime my hands go towards [51:23] my dogs i want that to be something good [51:26] i'm gonna play with them with a toy i'm [51:28] going to pet them i'm going to give them [51:30] a treat we want our hands to always be [51:32] seen as something positive never as [51:35] something as a punishment again like a [51:37] knife hand or something like that i've [51:39] seen people do that that can cause a dog [51:42] to become aggressive and it can cause a [51:44] dog to lose trust in us and be afraid of [51:46] us so of course that's something we [51:48] don't want to do [51:50] okay let's see [51:56] lots of questions [52:00] sorry give me a second i'm trying to [52:01] read a good one [52:08] okay so one involves two dogs [52:11] two shepherds a three-year-old [52:13] and an eight-month-old so the male loves [52:16] to play fetch but when they play [52:19] together the female tries to chase the [52:22] male in frustration let me see my female [52:24] tends [52:26] to just chase him in frustration barking [52:28] biting okay so the female the eight [52:31] month old female is still a puppy and it [52:34] sounds like she just really doesn't know [52:36] the game yet if i'm going to be playing [52:38] fetch and i'm going to have multiple [52:40] dogs i want to make sure each one [52:42] understands the game so in this [52:44] situation what i would do is i would [52:46] take the female out and i would get her [52:48] to really understand and enjoy the [52:50] concept of playing fetch [52:53] that way when we're playing fetch with [52:55] both dogs she's gonna know okay we're [52:57] playing fetch this is what we're doing [52:59] we're not doing any other activity it [53:02] could also be because she enjoys chasing [53:05] the other dog more she enjoys chasing [53:07] the german shepherd [53:09] it's something that i've seen quite [53:11] often as well with dogs that i would [53:12] have in for [53:14] board and train [53:15] i would have the dogs out playing with [53:17] all the dogs playing fetch with my dogs [53:20] and whatever dogs also enjoy playing [53:22] fetch and some of the dogs just want to [53:23] chase the other dogs that's what that [53:25] dog enjoys remember our dogs do [53:29] behaviors based on what is most [53:31] motivating and for her [53:33] it seems like the most motivating [53:34] activity is chasing the other dog that's [53:36] become a game for her so again i would [53:38] go back i would play fetch with just her [53:40] make sure she understands the game make [53:42] sure you have some good obedience and [53:45] then play with both dogs together if [53:47] you're still running into issues then [53:49] you need to go back a step and work more [53:51] with the female separately but you have [53:53] to be able to reinforce expectations so [53:55] the obedience is going to play a big [53:57] part as well for that [53:59] okay [54:04] a german shepherd barking from some days [54:06] during training so barking [54:10] i'm not 100 sure if i understand that [54:13] question but i'm going to assume that it [54:15] is based on getting a dog or teaching a [54:17] dog maybe a quiet command this is [54:20] something that a lot of people want to [54:21] know is how do i teach a dog to be quiet [54:26] the best way to teach a dog to be quiet [54:29] is to use the command let's say you want [54:32] to use the command quiet [54:34] if you use that as a condition [54:37] correction [54:38] so what i mean by that [54:40] our markers if we're talking about [54:43] markers [54:44] in order for a word or sound to be a [54:46] marker it must predict one of the four [54:49] quadrants of opera conditioning that's [54:51] your positive and negative reinforcement [54:53] positive and negative punishment if you [54:55] have a sound that predicts one of those [54:57] by definition it is now a marker [55:01] no [55:02] for the dogs that i train predicts [55:04] positive punishment so no becomes a [55:06] marker it's a condition correction [55:08] if the dog does something we don't like [55:10] we say no and we give the dog a [55:12] correction [55:13] so what i mean by that is i treat quiet [55:17] the same way so when the dog barks [55:20] quiet [55:21] then i give the dog a correction [55:23] every time the dog barks quiet [55:25] correction quiet correction and i [55:28] continue to do this up until the point [55:31] where the dog barks i tell them quiet [55:34] and they instantly go quiet [55:36] now the dog knows the command [55:39] once i say quiet they know they need to [55:40] be quiet and now i can use quiet without [55:43] having to correct my dog [55:45] that is the fastest most effective way [55:48] to teach the quiet command i've seen [55:50] videos out there where you can teach the [55:52] dog to bark and the moment the dog's not [55:54] barking you say quiet and then you tell [55:56] them good dog that doesn't really teach [55:58] them quiet and it doesn't really work [56:00] the most effective way like i said they [56:02] bark quiet correction [56:05] and as i said once you tell them quiet [56:07] and they stop barking now you've taught [56:08] the dog the behavior just like any other [56:11] command we're trying to teach our dog [56:12] remember the process for teaching a [56:14] command first you want to make sure your [56:16] dog knows the markers markers then you [56:18] want to make sure you can present a [56:19] physical cue that guarantees the dog [56:22] will do the behavior [56:24] once you have a physical cue in this [56:26] case the correction guarantees the [56:28] behavior that you want then you could [56:30] teach the dog the command the command [56:32] always comes before the physical cue [56:35] just like i said earlier in this video [56:36] today questions and then answers the [56:39] question comes first which is the [56:41] command the answer is the physical cue [56:43] that guarantees the dog will do the [56:45] behavior so sit then lift [56:48] down [56:49] then lower to the ground heal then guide [56:52] into the position and we continue to [56:54] give them the answer up until the point [56:56] where we ask the question and they give [56:58] us the answer before we provide it for [57:00] them and it's good to look at it that [57:02] way because just like if you were to ask [57:03] somebody a question you can't give them [57:06] the answer at the exact moment you ask [57:08] the question you have to give the [57:10] question first and then you can follow [57:12] it up with the answer it's the same with [57:14] our dogs if you deliver the question at [57:17] the exact moment you give the dog the [57:19] answer i talk about this often in a lot [57:20] of my videos it's known as overshadowing [57:23] if two things are presented to a dog at [57:25] the exact same time whatever is more [57:28] relevant to the dog is what they are [57:30] going to focus on and they're going to [57:31] completely ignore the other element so [57:34] it has to be separated by about a half [57:36] second or so [57:37] now [57:39] just because the dog knows the quiet [57:40] command doesn't mean that they're going [57:42] to be quiet every time you tell them [57:43] quiet and if that does happen [57:46] then you go to what [57:48] tom rose calls three times in a freebie [57:51] that's if you're using this type of [57:52] training three times in a freebie what [57:54] that means is [57:56] if my dog now knows the quiet command my [57:58] dog barks i tell my dog quiet and my [58:00] dog's quiet [58:02] it's fine it's working let's say for a [58:03] couple weeks then one day my dog barks i [58:05] say quiet my dog ignores me and [58:08] continues to bark [58:10] the next three times i give my dog the [58:12] quiet command i'm going to give my dog [58:15] an automatic correction so i'm going to [58:17] go back to using the physical cue to [58:19] teach the desired behavior dog barks no [58:22] correction [58:23] dog barks no correction [58:25] later on dog barks no correction or [58:27] sorry quiet correction quiet correction [58:29] quiet correction [58:30] then after the third one on the fourth [58:33] one when the dog barks i say quiet and i [58:35] don't correct as long as the dog is [58:38] quiet now the dog is back on freebies [58:40] that's why it's called three three times [58:42] in a freebie [58:44] okay let's see what else we have [58:54] okay so this one is a nine-month-old [58:58] pit boxer mix [58:59] can do tricks leash pressure pretty well [59:01] with the martingale collar but they [59:04] cannot get him to calm down and stop [59:06] jumping up on people new [59:08] so in my video where i talk about [59:10] teaching a dog not to jump up on people [59:12] i use the same technique that i use when [59:14] i'm teaching a dog not to go into a [59:16] certain room not to jump up on furniture [59:19] when i'm teaching the stay and i use the [59:21] marker that predicts negative [59:23] reinforcement so when my dog's meeting [59:25] new people i let them know my dog's [59:28] going to jump up when my dog jumps up [59:30] stop petting i'm going to remove my dog [59:34] once my dog has all four paws back on [59:36] the ground then you can go back to [59:38] petting my dog [59:40] okay great now i walk up the dog jumps [59:43] up they stop petting i say wrong i use [59:46] the leash pressure to cue the dog off [59:48] i do this over and over again up until [59:50] the point where the dog jumps up i say [59:53] wrong and the dog jumps off [59:55] once the dog does that then i can add [59:58] positive punishment just like everything [60:00] else to get reliability so now the dog [60:03] jumps up but instead of saying wrong i [60:05] would say no i give the dog a correction [60:08] then i tell the dog what i want off then [60:10] if i need to i can use the leash [60:12] pressure to cue the dog off so now [60:14] there's a consequence to jumping up [60:16] you wouldn't want to use a remote [60:18] training collar [60:21] one of the rules that i tell people to [60:22] follow if you're using a remote training [60:24] collar is to not use the collar when the [60:27] dog is actively engaged with another [60:30] human or animal meaning the dog is [60:32] touching another human or animal because [60:35] if we use the remote collar in that [60:37] situation [60:38] sometimes the dog may think that it's [60:40] the other human or the other animal [60:43] doing that to them and they can become [60:45] aggressive towards that human or that [60:47] animal so that's why we want to use a [60:49] leash and collar now if you had the mar [60:51] a remote collar on and you've had the [60:53] leash and you pop the leash at the exact [60:55] moment you stimulated the collar that [60:57] would probably be okay but i would [60:59] probably i would more likely to not stay [61:01] away from that as well and i would just [61:03] use a leash pop that's going to help get [61:05] the reliability that i want because now [61:07] there's a consequence to jumping up but [61:09] again you have to make sure that your [61:10] dog knows the rules before you add a [61:13] correction if you add corrections too [61:14] soon you can create a very cautious [61:17] fearful dog that's worried about doing [61:19] behaviors because behaviors can be [61:21] dangerous to them so we want to make [61:22] sure they know the rules [61:25] uh how to prevent dog from jumping up on [61:27] couch that goes back to what i was just [61:29] saying i start with the leash pressure [61:30] dog jumps up wrong i cue the dog off i [61:33] continue to do that until the dog jumps [61:35] up and i say wrong and the dog jumps off [61:37] on their own once they show me that next [61:40] time they jump up on the furniture i'm [61:41] going to add a correction so now they [61:43] jump up no correction off and then i use [61:47] the leash to cue them off something i am [61:49] asked because a lot of times when i talk [61:50] about corrections i just say correction [61:52] a correction for the dogs that i train [61:54] is either a leash pop or a stimulation [61:56] on a remote training collar if the dog [61:59] is already trained on the collar we have [62:01] to go through the process to teach them [62:03] the remote training collar but that's a [62:04] correction i don't like to make [62:06] corrections personal that's why i tell [62:08] people to not use your hand don't hit or [62:11] smack a dog or kick a dog or anything [62:13] like that because that's going to create [62:15] fear issues [62:17] a non-personal correction with a leash [62:19] pop is usually all we need or the remote [62:22] training collar again after the dog's [62:23] been trained on the collar [62:25] okay let's see what else we have [62:27] so as you guys can see [62:29] at least with the questions that i've [62:30] answered so far [62:32] a lot of the solutions follow the same [62:34] process [62:35] and this is why i put together that one [62:37] video on the behavioral and modification [62:40] flow chart if you follow the correction [62:43] correctly [62:44] you should be able to fix most problems [62:46] and if you've added corrections and [62:48] you're not getting results [62:50] that can mean a few things either the [62:53] dog is unaware of what you're telling [62:55] them to do because your timing is off [62:57] or [62:58] the correction is not adequate to the [63:00] dog's bank account so you're giving them [63:02] a correction that's not high enough to [63:03] get them to stop the behavior so for [63:05] example let's say you have a dog that's [63:07] doing a behavior that needs a hundred [63:08] and fifty dollar ticket to get them to [63:10] stop the behavior and you're giving them [63:12] ten dollar tickets that's not enough to [63:14] get them to change the behavior the [63:15] correction would have to be higher [63:19] okay [63:25] okay so how would you apply hand [63:27] corrections when you need to the only [63:29] time if i do need to use my hands to [63:31] correct that the dog doesn't have a [63:33] collar on or something like that is i [63:35] might grab the dog's scruff to move them [63:38] so that would be the most that i would [63:39] do with a hand correction again you want [63:42] to avoid anything like smacking or [63:44] hitting dogs or anything like that so [63:46] i'll give you a quick example [63:49] i don't remember what i told my dog ari [63:51] to do this was a few years back but she [63:53] didn't listen to me i grabbed her scruff [63:55] and i moved her i just made her do it so [63:58] that shows her like [63:59] i don't care if you don't if you don't [64:00] want to do it or not and if you don't [64:02] have a collar on you're going to have to [64:04] comply it was something like she broke a [64:06] stay and she didn't want to go back to [64:07] it i don't again i don't remember what [64:09] the situation was but i just reinforced [64:11] it and again i treated it like anything [64:13] else it wasn't personal it was cause and [64:15] effect once she was doing what i wanted [64:17] good girl nice job way to go again we [64:20] always want to make sure we have a [64:21] really good strong relationship with our [64:23] dogs [64:25] all right [64:28] uh someone who said they just found my [64:30] channel this week thanks for [64:32] checking out the channel if you are new [64:34] to the channel i recommend checking out [64:37] my video everything you need to know to [64:39] train your dog [64:40] that's basically my basic obedience [64:43] series condensed into about two hours [64:47] and 40 minutes so that was the the [64:50] smallest i could condense it it was [64:52] actually recommended by somebody i don't [64:53] know if this person has watched the [64:55] video or seen it but somebody [64:57] recommended it in my comments they said [64:59] the basic obedience series is a little [65:01] overwhelming if you could put it into a [65:03] more condensed video i'm sure that would [65:05] be much appreciated i did and people [65:08] have really enjoyed it so [65:10] if you're watching and you're the one [65:11] who recommended that i put that video [65:13] together thanks for the recommendation [65:16] okay what else [65:20] all right someone's asking about their [65:22] dog as far as not being aggressive [65:24] towards other dogs [65:27] if you have a dog that is aggressive and [65:30] it's a learned behavior that's going to [65:33] be easier to work with than a dog that [65:36] has [65:37] aggressive genetics in a sense now you [65:40] can work with any dog that has [65:42] aggression issues as long as it's not [65:45] too extreme i actually talked about it [65:47] in one of my videos [65:50] the 10 different or 10 miss or five [65:52] minutes i don't remember of dog training [65:54] one of the myths is you can train every [65:56] dog or every dog is trainable which is [65:58] not true unfortunately there are some [66:01] dogs that have such extreme issues the [66:04] example that i talked about was [66:06] in a book that i read recently [66:09] for the love of a dog by patricia [66:12] mcconnell i kind of think i'm saying her [66:14] name correctly she's excellent actually [66:15] i got the book over here [66:17] now i'm not gonna go grab it i got my [66:19] lights set up i'm gonna knock it down [66:20] but for the love of a dog excellent book [66:22] on understanding emotions with our [66:25] animals and there was a situation that [66:27] she had where [66:28] when the dog was only five weeks old as [66:32] a puppy the owners had given it cocaine [66:35] as a joke and it just [66:37] fried the dog's brain [66:38] and by the time the dog was older it was [66:40] so aggressive and so [66:43] uncontrolled like they just couldn't [66:45] control this dog it was really a [66:47] liability and it was because of the [66:49] trauma that the dog experienced at such [66:51] a young age so that can happen but [66:53] anyways going back to the dog on dog [66:55] aggression if i have a dog that is [66:58] aggressive towards other dogs this isn't [67:00] going to be the answer that most people [67:01] like [67:03] but i just keep the dog away from other [67:04] dogs the dog doesn't like other dogs and [67:07] this dog is a malinois [67:10] i believe i lost where the question was [67:12] but [67:13] malinois enjoy interacting with their [67:16] humans they enjoy playing tug they enjoy [67:18] doing [67:19] different games fetch things like that [67:21] so if i have a dog that's aggressive [67:23] towards other dogs again i'm just going [67:25] to keep that dog away from other dogs [67:27] and i'm going to make sure i play with [67:29] that dog enough give it enough [67:30] interaction with me and and make sure it [67:33] still lives an enjoyable life the reason [67:35] why i say this is because in order to [67:38] work with a dog that is dog aggressive [67:40] you have to expose the dog to other dogs [67:44] and [67:45] for me i don't think it's fair to put [67:47] other dogs that are really nice and [67:49] friendly to other dogs in a bad [67:51] situation where they might be bitten or [67:54] have a bad experience and now we have [67:56] another dog with issues so that's why [67:59] for the most part [68:00] i work on the dog's obedience [68:03] and i try to mask the aggression with [68:05] obedience but again i'm not trying my [68:08] goal is not going to be i want to get [68:09] this dog to hang out at a dog park and [68:12] play with other dogs that really [68:13] wouldn't be very realistic and some dogs [68:16] just don't like other dogs but i'm sure [68:18] this malinois enjoys hanging out with [68:20] you so again i would be doing tug with [68:22] this dog plane fetch interacting and i [68:25] would really keep the dog away from [68:26] other dogs now if the dog is reactive [68:29] towards other dogs and i don't have any [68:31] interest in getting the dog to play with [68:33] other dogs but i want the dog to be more [68:36] reliable with obedience then i would go [68:38] back to what i talked about earlier in [68:39] this video and i would do obedience at a [68:42] local dog park but not inside of the dog [68:45] park again i would be outside of the dog [68:47] park far enough away to where my dog's [68:49] not reacting in any sort of negative [68:52] manner and i would work my dog in that [68:54] situation then over time i would get [68:56] closer and closer to the dog park [68:59] to where i'm using that concept of [69:01] desensitization [69:03] and my dog becomes used to seeing other [69:04] dogs but not interacting with other dogs [69:08] and that's a good place to do that [69:09] because [69:10] the dogs are not going to be able to run [69:11] up to your dog because you're going to [69:13] be outside of the dog park the other [69:15] dogs are going to be inside of the dog [69:17] park some of them might try to look to [69:18] check you out to see what you're doing [69:20] but once they realize they can't engage [69:22] with you that's going to be boring for [69:24] them and they're going to go back and [69:25] play with the other dogs inside of the [69:26] dog park so that's a good way to get a [69:28] dog desensitized to being around other [69:30] dogs but again i wouldn't have that dog [69:34] actively trying to engage with other [69:36] dogs some people will try to do muzzle [69:38] training they'll put the dog [69:40] on a muzzle and then they'll put the dog [69:42] into an environment with other dogs [69:44] that's not always the best either [69:45] because now that dog's going to be very [69:47] stressed out [69:48] it's going to try to muzzle punch other [69:50] dogs other dogs might react in a [69:53] negative way now towards that dog so [69:54] again for me obedience is going to be [69:57] key and [69:59] playing with my dog away from other dogs [70:01] is also going to be key [70:03] all right [70:04] what else do we have [70:11] okay so i see one asking about and [70:14] right now i'm just looking at the [70:16] questions at the bottom so many [70:17] questions have come through at this [70:18] point if i missed your question just put [70:21] it in again and i'll try to get to it [70:23] i'm probably going to do another 15 [70:25] minutes or so uh but this one is how do [70:28] i make my five month old puppy [70:30] lay down [70:32] so it says lay down on his front legs [70:34] i'm assuming you just mean having the [70:36] dog go into the down [70:38] so sometimes dogs will resist the down [70:41] you'll try to lure them into the down [70:43] position a lot of you watching have [70:45] probably ran into the same issue before [70:48] the dog's head goes down but their back [70:50] end stays up in the air they don't want [70:52] to lay down all the way the first thing [70:54] i try to do if i'm working with a dog [70:56] like that is i will [70:58] look at how we're holding the food so if [71:01] you're holding the food as a bowl i have [71:03] a video where i talk about this it's [71:05] titled power steering [71:08] the way i hold food is i cup it in my [71:10] hand so i put it in my hand i cup it [71:12] this gives the dog [71:13] a nice valley to place their muzzle into [71:15] one of my other friends ally she says [71:17] she says she tells people to make their [71:19] hands a little taco but the dog is able [71:22] to place their mouth into that valley [71:24] where the food is and now i can use it [71:26] just [71:26] guiding and manipulating my dog into [71:28] different positions when i do it down if [71:31] you bring let's say that the bottom of [71:33] the phone is the ground [71:35] or the screen rather if i bring my hand [71:37] down and i'm treating it like a bowl [71:39] then the dog is just going to be able to [71:41] place their muzzle into it and eat the [71:43] food and their back end will often stay [71:45] up [71:45] that's why if you've seen my video how [71:47] to teach your dog to lay down i create a [71:49] cave so if again the bottom of the [71:52] screen is the ground this way the dog [71:54] has to bring their muzzle underneath the [71:57] cave in order to get to the food which [72:00] when they do that it naturally will [72:02] bring the back end down [72:04] now even that won't work on every dog if [72:08] that's the case then what i'm going to [72:10] do is i'm going to do all the other [72:12] commands [72:13] easy one sit get the dog to walk forward [72:16] with the food lure then i'm going to [72:17] teach the dog leash pressure with the [72:19] sit and walking forward because i have [72:21] the lure for both of those and then i [72:23] will use the leash pressure to teach the [72:25] dog the down as well [72:27] now ideally of course we want to be able [72:29] to get the dog to go into the down by [72:30] using the food lure but again some dogs [72:33] may not do that the other thing that i [72:34] like to do is [72:36] if the dog still doesn't want to bring [72:38] down that back end and if you try to [72:40] push the dog moves away and they don't [72:42] want to continue trying another great [72:44] option is to have a handful of food [72:47] when you lure your dog down give them [72:50] one piece at a time so what happens is [72:52] we're feeding them one piece at a time [72:54] the dog is taking one piece and the back [72:56] end is still up then they get tired of [72:58] having that back end up and they lay [73:00] down the moment they lay down i mark and [73:02] i open my hand and i give them the rest [73:05] of the food that's in my hand [73:06] the reason why i do that if you have a [73:09] dog that has low perseverance they'll [73:11] give up [73:12] and i've seen it really [73:14] more often than not you try to lure the [73:16] dog into the position the dog tries to [73:18] go for the food and they go ah too [73:21] difficult and they walk away [73:23] if that's happening again we want to [73:25] give our dog rewards for putting in the [73:27] effort that's why i like to have my hand [73:29] filled with food and then once the dog [73:32] lays down i give them everything that's [73:34] remaining and that teaches them oh if i [73:36] go right into the down position i'm [73:39] gonna get to the reward [73:40] way faster than if i take one piece at a [73:43] time [73:44] okay [73:49] all right now i lost where i was so many [73:50] questions coming in [73:58] okay so uh recall i saw one with a [74:01] recall [74:02] sorry there's a lot of questions coming [74:03] in so i'm trying to get to them all [74:05] uh if you're having issues with recall [74:07] just like with any other command if you [74:10] know your dog knows the command if you [74:12] taught them leash pressure [74:14] and they have been given a clear path to [74:16] success they know how to turn on [74:17] pressure by complying then you could add [74:19] corrections so when i first teach a dog [74:21] the recall command i start with the dog [74:23] directly in front of me and i do the [74:26] backwards follow exercise and this is [74:28] where we just walk backwards and we give [74:30] the dog food as we're walking backwards [74:32] when we stop we lift our hand up which [74:35] naturally gets our dog to look up once [74:37] they look up and their butt hits the [74:38] ground we mark and we give them a piece [74:40] of food [74:41] then i start building distance i call [74:42] the dog to me and i present the same [74:44] physical cue that i was using for the [74:46] backwards follow exercise [74:48] and we just add distance [74:50] and then once the dog starts to [74:51] understand it we can start to remove the [74:53] physical cue so the come when called is [74:56] a little bit different than some of the [74:58] other commands where we use a physical [74:59] cue let me give you an example if i'm [75:01] doing the down and i'm luring the dog [75:03] into the down position i'm just luring [75:04] the dog into the position it's a very [75:06] straightforward command you say down the [75:08] dogs drop into the position so you say [75:10] down lure yes reward down boom the dog [75:13] does the down great we taught the [75:15] command but with a come when called if [75:18] you're doing it the way that i like to [75:19] do it a lot of competitive dog trainers [75:22] like to do it this way is the common [75:24] call is not just [75:26] come to me and run right past me or jump [75:28] on me or do something like that it's [75:30] come to the sit front position and the [75:33] sit front position is the dog is [75:35] directly in front of us as close to us [75:37] as possible without touching us looking [75:39] up at our face while sitting that's [75:41] going to be the sit front so i like to [75:43] call the dogs into that position and [75:45] that's why i lure them into the position [75:47] making sure that my hands are centered [75:50] to keep them nice centered and straight [75:53] so when we start adding more distance [75:54] for the common call you call your dog [75:56] come [75:58] if you haven't done the physical cue [76:00] enough the dog will start to come to you [76:02] but they may not know to get right into [76:04] that perfect sit front position [76:06] so i read the dog as they're coming [76:08] towards me i stand with my hands down i [76:10] go come [76:11] as i'm watching the dog if i notice they [76:12] might need a little bit of help then i [76:14] help them with that physical cue to get [76:16] them right into that sit front position [76:19] and i continue to do it and as i watch [76:20] the dog you can see [76:22] whether or not they're going to be going [76:24] into that sit front position or if [76:26] they're going to be maybe off to the [76:28] right off to the left you can see that [76:30] they're not doing it exactly the way [76:31] that you want then you assist them in [76:33] the process and over time you'll get to [76:36] the point where the dog comes on in and [76:37] they do that nice sit front position so [76:39] to answer your question though if i know [76:41] the dog knows a command first of all we [76:44] don't want to give our dogs commands [76:47] that we cannot reinforce if they decide [76:50] not to do it [76:51] this is why i teach every dog that i [76:54] work with informal commands now what's [76:57] an informal command we have formal [76:59] commands and we have informal commands [77:02] informal command is going to be [77:04] something like come on guys let's go [77:07] all right my dog's just sat up because [77:08] of that [77:09] but an informal command is going to be [77:11] that it's very informal the formal [77:14] command would be the come or sit or down [77:17] something like that that's very formal [77:19] informal commands i don't reinforce if i [77:22] tell my dogs come on guys let's go come [77:24] on come on and they don't come i'm not [77:26] it's not a big deal because it's not a [77:27] command but if i tell them come or down [77:31] or heal [77:32] now that's a command and it must be [77:34] reinforced if they choose not to do it [77:37] so if i notice that my dog's starting [77:39] not to come to me when i call them let's [77:41] say the dog's in the backyard doesn't [77:42] want to come inside well with my dogs [77:44] i'm going to use the remote collar [77:46] because i can reinforce it with that [77:47] because they're already directional to [77:48] the collar if the dog wasn't directional [77:51] to the collar then i'm going to use a [77:53] long line so now i can tell the dog to [77:55] come to me if the dog chooses not to [77:57] come to me i can say no i can pick up [77:59] the long line give the dog a correction [78:01] recommand and then assist the dog back [78:03] to me [78:04] they have to know that you're going to [78:05] follow through don't make the common [78:07] mistake of [78:09] asking your dog to do certain behaviors [78:12] and then not reinforcing it because you [78:14] don't feel like it because of whatever [78:16] you know the dogs outside you don't want [78:18] to go outside and get them you're [78:20] sitting down relaxing on the couch you [78:22] tell your dog to down your dog doesn't [78:23] lay down and you're like ah forget it [78:27] now the dog's starting to learn in [78:29] certain situations they don't have to [78:31] comply so anytime you give a command [78:34] make sure you can follow through and you [78:35] can get the dog to do it [78:39] okay so someone's asking about um [78:41] getting their dog comfortable with [78:43] gunfire i talked about this a little bit [78:45] earlier in the video [78:47] but that was more towards protection [78:48] training if you want your dog to be [78:50] comfortable with gunfire you're not [78:51] doing protection work maybe you're [78:53] working with a hunting dog or you're [78:55] just you live in your gun range or [78:57] something like that then what you want [78:59] to do is you want to go to the place so [79:01] i i would use a gun range [79:03] go to a local gun range if there's one [79:05] nearby go far enough away outside of the [79:07] gun range where you can hear the gunfire [79:10] but it's not loud enough that it causes [79:12] any sort of discomfort to your dog and [79:14] then play with your dog do some [79:15] obedience [79:17] just get them to associate that sound [79:18] with fun and again you're far enough [79:20] away that it's not so loud that it's [79:22] creating stress [79:24] and then every day [79:26] get closer and closer and closer to the [79:29] gun range up until the point where [79:30] you're right next to the gun range and [79:33] your dog doesn't care and your dog wants [79:35] to play because that's what you've [79:37] conditioned your dog to they hear [79:38] gunfire and they go oh this means we're [79:40] playing but again that's why you want to [79:42] start far enough away where if you start [79:45] too close it's going to be too stressful [79:47] so start far away and this could take a [79:49] good amount of time it really depends on [79:51] the dog some dogs you might be able to [79:53] progress within a week the dog's [79:55] perfectly fine with gunfire other dogs [79:57] may take a couple months so i just [80:00] pay attention to the dog [80:01] i read the dog and that's going to [80:04] determine how quickly i'm going to move [80:07] closer to the gun range to get the dog [80:09] desensitized to it and what i mean by [80:11] reading the dog [80:13] if i bring the dog out and let's say i'm [80:15] 150 yards away from the gun range day [80:18] one dogs great no issues the next day [80:21] i'm like you know what i'm gonna try 100 [80:22] yards away from the gun range and i try [80:25] and my dog is doing this i'm trying to [80:26] engage with my dog let's say you're me [80:29] and i'm the dog and you're trying to [80:30] play tug and normally i'm jumping up i'm [80:32] having a good time playing tug and i'm [80:34] doing this i'm looking constantly in the [80:37] direction of the gunfire okay i [80:39] progressed too quickly [80:41] let's go back to 135 yards so that's [80:44] what i mean by reading the dog if they [80:46] seem like they're uncomfortable in the [80:47] situation that means you've progressed [80:48] too quickly and you need to go back a [80:50] step [80:53] okay let's see [80:57] uh if an adult dog barks to someone and [81:01] a puppy gets scared of people because of [81:03] that how can i bring back confidence to [81:05] the puppy and how to help a dog [81:08] terrified to extreme [81:11] uh okay so dog going into an elevator [81:14] if we are working with a dog that has [81:17] fear issues again counter conditioning [81:20] and desensitization is going to be your [81:22] best friend and really again what that [81:24] means is you're exposing your dog to [81:26] whatever it is that they're afraid of [81:28] but at a low enough stimuli that you're [81:31] not getting a bad reaction so the [81:35] elevator could be the same as [81:38] the vehicle the car if you look at my q [81:41] a video that i posted about two weeks [81:43] ago [81:44] there's one where somebody was having [81:46] issues with their dogs going into the [81:47] car you would just want to change what [81:49] it predicts so if i have a dog that's [81:50] afraid of the elevator i'm going to take [81:52] the dog to the elevator [81:54] and i might do a little bit of [81:56] obedience give him some treats again i [81:58] say obedience because [82:00] if you do obedience correctly the dog [82:03] should enjoy obedience obedience should [82:05] be fun [82:07] obedience shouldn't be oh this sucks i [82:10] don't want to do obedience no it should [82:11] be fun so i say it because it should be [82:13] fun and we're using something the dog [82:15] enjoys so i would take the dog to the [82:17] elevator i would open the door i would [82:19] play with the dog and then i would leave [82:21] i wouldn't even have the dog go in i [82:23] would get the dog used to seeing the [82:24] door opening and closing then i would go [82:26] to the elevator i would walk in and then [82:28] i would walk right out i wouldn't have [82:30] to wait for the dog to close i'm gonna [82:32] build the dog up over time showing them [82:34] that it's not a scary place just because [82:37] we're going to the elevator doesn't mean [82:38] that we're going to be going into this [82:40] room where the door closes and then when [82:43] it does when we do that then i want to [82:45] make sure i'm only going one floor let's [82:48] say you [82:50] have to travel six floors that could be [82:52] too long of a duration when i actually [82:54] start to go into the elevator and the [82:55] first time i go in the elevator [82:57] hopefully no one pushes the button on a [82:59] different floor [83:00] but i would close it and i would open it [83:02] right back up and leave so i would do [83:04] that a bunch of times get the dog [83:06] comfortable with that and then i would [83:08] go one floor at a time get the dog [83:10] comfortable with that and then [83:11] eventually we can get to the point where [83:13] the dog has no issues going into the [83:15] elevator but for anyone watching if [83:17] you're having any fear issues definitely [83:19] check out my video on fear and [83:20] aggression but it's all about counter [83:22] conditioning and desensitization that's [83:25] what we want to use with any dog that [83:27] has fear issues and often same thing [83:30] with issues [83:31] that fall under aggression [83:34] uh [83:35] someone said oh oss yeah so if you ever [83:38] see us [83:39] that's a jiu jitsu thing so those that [83:42] do not do jujitsu i highly recommend jiu [83:45] jitsu just as much as i recommend dog [83:48] training if you're watching this and [83:50] you've never tried jiu jitsu before [83:52] go to a local jiu jitsu club give it a [83:54] shot you won't regret it it's one of [83:57] my all-time favorite things to do next [83:59] to dog training okay [84:01] let's see 14 week puppy seems very [84:03] skittish and scared with leaving the [84:05] front door and we'll pull and go crazy [84:07] to go back inside [84:09] so that's going to go back to counter [84:11] conditioning desensitization if i'm [84:13] using leash pressure i have to make sure [84:14] the dog understands the leash pressure [84:16] first with a young puppy 14 week old [84:19] puppy that doesn't like to go out the [84:20] front door i'm just gonna carry the [84:21] puppy i'll walk out let the dog check [84:24] out the area i'll walk right back in [84:26] i'll get the puppy used to that to where [84:29] it's not a big deal but yeah if we start [84:31] to try to use something like leash [84:33] pressure for something that the dog is [84:35] really afraid of it could make it worse [84:38] so going back to that counter [84:40] conditioning and desensitization i'm [84:42] going to see what other questions are i [84:43] don't want to spend too much more time [84:45] on fear issues that's going to be the [84:47] main approach that's what i'm going to [84:49] say for most issues when it does come to [84:51] fear and it does work when you use it [84:53] correctly and again if you notice that [84:54] you're having issues often it's because [84:56] you're progressing too quickly [85:00] okay [85:03] okay uh this next one is increasing a [85:05] dog's perseverance so if a dog has low [85:08] perseverance we can increase [85:10] perseverance through success so success [85:13] builds success it's something tom rose [85:15] used to always say in class uh excellent [85:18] dog trainer if you don't know who he is [85:20] he's the founder of the tom rose school [85:23] that's where i went to school for two [85:24] years to become a professional dog [85:26] trainer and i was an assistant [85:29] instructor there [85:30] tom rose is awesome incredible [85:33] incredible dog trainer but that's [85:34] something he used to always say and it [85:36] stuck with me [85:37] success builds success when we're [85:39] working with our dogs for example one of [85:41] the exercises that they have in schitzen [85:44] it's known as [85:45] people call it shits in [85:47] it's igp now for a while it was ipo [85:50] but schutzen is a [85:53] sport that is separated into three [85:56] categories protection obedience and [85:58] tracking [86:00] and in the obedience there's what's [86:03] known as a send out you walk with your [86:05] dog and heal [86:06] pull it up you guys can see some really [86:08] awesome videos on it there's some [86:10] phenomenal trainers out there that have [86:12] some really beautiful send outs and they [86:14] take about five paces and then they tell [86:16] their dog run or whatever their command [86:18] is and the dog takes off the dog just [86:20] runs straight [86:22] once the dog runs a certain distance [86:25] the judge will give the handler i think [86:28] they give him the hand the handle or a [86:29] signal or [86:31] they just tell the dog to do it i'm not [86:33] quite sure i'd have to double check the [86:34] rules but anyways at one point they have [86:36] to give the dog the command down so they [86:39] down and the dog has to just lay down [86:40] mid run [86:42] what tom rose used he still does when [86:44] he's teaching send outs and he's [86:46] teaching recalls [86:47] he has this wire that goes over the top [86:50] of the field [86:51] and then he has a leash that comes down [86:54] that you can hook onto the dog's collar [86:56] and what it does is it prevents the dog [86:58] from running too far left or too far [87:00] right so they learn to run straight they [87:02] start to run too far to the left or [87:04] right [87:05] the leash brings them right back it [87:07] doesn't hurt them [87:08] completely safe [87:10] and it works so well that anytime he [87:13] tells the dogs to run they run perfectly [87:15] straight in center and they never veer [87:17] off and that's just an example of [87:19] success builds success so going back to [87:22] perseverance if i notice i have a dog [87:24] with low perseverance they give up [87:26] easily then i'm going to make sure i [87:28] give them a ton of small wins if needed [87:32] another good example i was talking about [87:33] the down earlier a lot of dogs with [87:36] lower perseverance if you try to get [87:37] them to do the spin command and you try [87:39] to lure them into a circle they'll start [87:41] to turn if they don't get the food [87:44] within the first few seconds they give [87:47] up they go ah that's too hard [87:49] if i notice that as i start to lure the [87:51] dog yes reward right there i start to [87:53] lure yes reward i start to lure yes [87:55] reward so before i can even get the dog [87:58] to do a full circle [87:59] i've given them about 15 rewards just [88:02] for doing partial [88:04] of the exercise so perseverance will [88:07] increase as the dog is successful if you [88:10] notice you're trying to get your dog to [88:12] do something too difficult for them and [88:14] they're giving up then you have to make [88:16] sure you give them wins for putting in [88:18] that effort and if you're [88:21] out there and you have a dog with super [88:22] super high perseverance [88:25] then you're lucky that you have a dog [88:26] with high perseverance because high [88:28] perseverance dogs makes it so much [88:31] easier to train you know for example my [88:33] dog ari her perseverance is through the [88:36] roof she'll just continue to try until [88:38] she's successful and often that makes it [88:40] very easy when teaching her new [88:42] behaviors [88:44] okay biting clothes doorknobs so [88:47] destructive behaviors anytime i have a [88:49] dog doing destructive behaviors i [88:51] correct the dog in the act again if [88:53] we're using corrections we don't make [88:55] the corrections personal so if i have a [88:57] dog i know the dog chews on furniture [88:59] number one we set dogs up for success so [89:02] we can reward them the exact [89:04] excuse me so we can reward them the [89:06] exact moment they do the behavior [89:08] correctly but we also set them up to [89:10] fail so we can correct them at the exact [89:13] moment they do the behavior that we [89:15] don't like if i know the dog is [89:17] destructive let's say there's a certain [89:19] blanket that the dog has already gotten [89:21] to chewed it up i'm gonna have that [89:23] sitting out i'm gonna wait till the [89:25] blanket or the dog goes to it the moment [89:27] they go to and they go to bite it no [89:29] correction they stop biting good let's [89:32] say your dog chews on shoes i'm gonna [89:34] have a bunch of shoes laying out the [89:36] moment the dog goes to the shoe no [89:39] correction and i'm going to correct the [89:40] dog for trying to do those behaviors [89:43] if i'm dealing again with destructive or [89:45] dangerous behaviors i correct those [89:47] right away i don't want the dog [89:48] practicing it i'm not going to try to [89:51] just redirect it because redirecting [89:53] those types of behaviors do not stop the [89:56] behaviors if you have a dog that chews [89:59] on furniture and someone says oh just [90:00] give your dog a different chew toy [90:02] that's going to stop the behavior no [90:04] it's not it's giving the dog a new [90:07] option you're saying hey here's [90:09] something you could chew on but the dog [90:11] goes oh cool i could chew on that [90:14] and i can chew on this now i have two [90:16] really cool things to chew on that's why [90:19] if they're doing it i just correct it [90:21] if you do it right away in the very [90:23] beginning they don't continue to [90:25] practice it and it quickly becomes an [90:26] issue of the past so that's how i stop [90:29] destructive or dangerous behaviors [90:32] okay someone said something about hand [90:35] feeding [90:36] can you talk about the important of hand [90:39] feeding is for training [90:41] now [90:42] when it comes to training our dogs [90:46] you'll see different videos or or [90:49] blogs where [90:50] people say things like you can train a [90:52] dog without rewards [90:54] i personally say to steer clear of that [90:57] unless you want to be a tyrant so if you [90:59] want to be a dictator and you just want [91:01] your dog to listen and you don't want to [91:02] pay them then you can do those different [91:04] options but for me [91:06] using rewards using treats that's going [91:08] to be the foundation of the training now [91:10] i posted a video not too long ago about [91:12] how to train without treats because we [91:15] obviously want to get our dogs to a [91:17] point where we can get them to do [91:18] behaviors without always having to be [91:21] rewarded for every single behavior and i [91:24] have it broken down into three stages [91:26] when i'm first teaching a dog a new [91:28] behavior i'm doing continual [91:29] reinforcement also we can use food for [91:32] different behaviors and in addition it [91:35] builds a strong relationship by training [91:37] our dogs with food anytime our dog is [91:40] experiencing something that they enjoy [91:43] they're going to associate that with [91:44] whatever they're doing and what i mean [91:46] by that is if you have your brand new [91:48] puppy and you're doing what myself a lot [91:51] of other trainers [91:52] and just people in general that are [91:54] training their dogs like to do is we [91:56] like to use meal time as training time [91:59] meaning we make the dog work for every [92:02] bite of food now this is only in the [92:04] beginning [92:06] another example both my dogs they have a [92:08] raw diet they eat their raw food and [92:10] then if i'm gonna train i might use some [92:12] freeze-dried dog food and then i'm gonna [92:14] use toys so they're still getting [92:16] rewards while training but they're not [92:18] getting as much as they were in the [92:19] beginning because in the beginning we're [92:21] using that continual reinforcement so [92:23] what i mean by what i was saying earlier [92:25] is [92:26] the dog enjoys eating they enjoy [92:29] training and they're doing both of these [92:31] activities with you it is really [92:33] strengthening that bond they're having a [92:35] strong positive association to the [92:37] training because of the food and they're [92:39] also associating that to you and now [92:41] you're going to have a relationship with [92:43] your dog that other people are going to [92:45] be envious about you know often people [92:47] see me with my dogs and they're like [92:49] they're so focused on you they love [92:51] being around you how did you do that [92:52] well just with training and using that [92:54] food it gives us the ability to do free [92:56] shaping exercises it gives us the [92:58] ability to do fix shaping exercises [93:00] which are excellent techniques to [93:02] teaching different behaviors [93:04] and [93:05] going back to spacing out those rewards [93:07] or how do we get to the point where we [93:09] don't have to give the dog a reward for [93:11] every single correct behavior the three [93:13] stages that i've broken it down to this [93:15] is what works best for me when i'm [93:17] teaching a new behavior i'm doing [93:19] continual reinforcement that means every [93:21] single time the dog does it they're [93:23] getting a reward [93:24] once the dog is no longer having to be [93:27] given the physical cue to get them to do [93:29] the behavior meaning you tell the dog [93:31] down and the dog lays down you don't [93:33] have to lure the dog into the down then [93:35] you move to stage two so now every time [93:38] your dog does the behavior correctly [93:39] you're gonna do one of two things either [93:41] you're going to mark and reward just [93:43] like you were doing at the very [93:44] beginning with that continual [93:45] reinforcement or you're going to give [93:48] your dog verbal praise verbal feedback [93:50] so now it's going to be instead of down [93:52] yes reward down yes reward down yes [93:54] reward it's going to be down and you [93:57] might say yes reward or free reward if [93:59] you're using free as a terminal marker [94:01] as i do or you might say down good boy [94:04] or good girl nice job excellent giving [94:07] them that verbal praise [94:09] then we're gonna do that for about two [94:11] weeks [94:13] and we'll move to stage three stage [94:15] three when the dog does the behavior [94:16] correctly you're going to do one of [94:18] three things either a mark and reward b [94:21] provide verbal praise or c [94:23] say nothing at all and then eventually [94:25] you're going to fade out a and b [94:28] until you can get the dog to do multiple [94:30] behaviors without having to be rewarded [94:32] on every single correct repetition but [94:34] you still want to give your dog the [94:36] reward i usually will reward my dogs [94:39] after doing anywhere between five or ten [94:41] different commands and then i'll throw [94:43] in a reward remember when our dogs are [94:45] doing behaviors i've mentioned this i [94:46] think three or four times in this video [94:48] it's always based on motivation so when [94:50] you ask your dog to do a behavior they [94:53] have to either a [94:54] think that if they do the behavior they [94:57] might get a reward [94:59] b they like doing the behavior it's fun [95:03] so it's a self-releasing behavior or c [95:06] they have to believe that if they don't [95:08] do the behavior there will be a [95:09] consequence and if we have those three [95:12] elements in play then we will have very [95:14] very reliable obedience [95:17] okay [95:21] another one with puppy biting so that [95:24] i would just recommend checking out my [95:25] video on puppy biting [95:27] i usually ignore it it doesn't bother me [95:29] some people don't like it because it [95:31] could be pretty painful if that's the [95:32] case usually correction's the easiest [95:34] way there's a couple other techniques [95:36] that i talk about in my puppy biting [95:38] video [95:43] uh okay so let's see [95:45] somebody's black lab jumps up and [95:47] punches new people he meets out of [95:49] excitement he [95:51] he's great with people and dogs apart [95:53] from that how can we train him out of [95:54] that i talked about that earlier in the [95:56] video i don't know exactly where but [95:59] i would recommend checking out my video [96:01] on the behavioral and modification flow [96:03] chart just to answer it quickly i first [96:05] teach what the dog is not allowed to do [96:07] using that marker that predicts negative [96:09] reinforcement once the dog knows the [96:11] rules then i can add correction in order [96:13] to get reliability now this has actually [96:16] been a pretty long video so far i was [96:18] only planning on doing 30 minutes but to [96:20] be honest with you guys i love talking [96:22] about dogs so people want to listen to [96:25] me talk about dogs i could i could do it [96:27] all day it's one of my favorite things [96:29] that and jiu-jitsu love both of those [96:31] things so if you've been watching this [96:34] entire time which if you have thanks [96:37] i know it's a long video [96:39] you'll notice that a lot of what i'm [96:41] talking about is very very similar [96:43] if we know the structure [96:45] then we can deal with any issue and [96:47] that's why [96:49] in my manual [96:51] um [96:52] i'm sure a lot of people have it if [96:54] you're watching my video right now [96:56] and you send me an email within the next [96:59] 10 minutes i'll send you a free copy of [97:02] my dog training manual [97:04] but chapter seven in my manual it's the [97:07] step-by-step process to teach a dog any [97:10] command it does not matter if you are [97:14] working with a puppy if you're working [97:16] with an older dog it doesn't matter what [97:18] you're training your dog [97:20] to perform the process is always the [97:23] same and that's why [97:25] anytime i'm talking to somebody about [97:27] dog training i try to stress the [97:30] importance of understanding the science [97:32] of dog training because the science [97:35] stays the same [97:36] what varies between each dog is going to [97:39] be things like their motivation their [97:41] perseverance their temperament their [97:43] disposition these things are going to [97:45] vary across the board but the science [97:48] remains the same and that's why it's so [97:49] important to understand the process now [97:52] um i'm sure a handful of people watching [97:55] this video right now are either in the [97:57] military or their prior military i was [97:59] in the military for eight years and what [98:02] works in my brain is having a [98:04] step-by-step process i need structure i [98:06] need to know if this happens what do i [98:09] have to do and that's why i came up with [98:11] that step-by-step process step one [98:13] teaching the markers step two teaching [98:15] the dog luring step three teaching leash [98:17] pressure step four teaching the command [98:20] by using the physical cues that we [98:21] established step five using the leash [98:24] pressure the physical cues and the [98:25] markers to reinforce and teach the stay [98:28] and then after all that we can add [98:30] corrections for a lot reliability and [98:32] that transfers over to behavioral issues [98:35] as well i know that's obedience but [98:37] remember with behavioral issues we don't [98:39] have much when it comes to behavioral [98:41] issues either we have fear aggression [98:43] destructive dangerous and behaviors we [98:46] just don't want our dogs to perform [98:48] that may not be dangerous or destructive [98:50] you may have a couch you don't want your [98:52] dog to go on the dog going on the couch [98:55] for the most part is not dangerous or [98:56] destructive unless it's [98:58] you know a leather couch that the dog [99:00] might scratch or it's you're worried [99:02] about the dog making it dirty but for [99:04] the most part it's not really a [99:05] dangerous or destructive behavior and [99:07] then we know how to approach each one of [99:09] these issues [99:11] so anyone that is running into any sort [99:14] of issues because i'm going to be ending [99:15] this video here very shortly [99:18] check out that video behavioral and [99:19] modification flow chart it's going to [99:22] show you exactly how to deal with any [99:24] issue that you may be running into and [99:26] then the video on [99:28] um everything you need to know to train [99:30] your dog [99:31] it is almost three hours but that that [99:34] does cover that step-by-step process [99:36] that i talked about [99:37] if you could watch that video fully [99:40] understand it and go out and practice [99:42] with multiple dogs [99:44] you can even become [99:46] almost i mean it's going to take a [99:47] little bit more experience and training [99:48] but that's almost enough to even go out [99:51] and start training dogs professionally [99:52] i'm not saying it is but it's close to [99:54] it as far as putting in the practice [99:56] because it covers a lot of that science [99:59] okay we got enough time for maybe a [100:01] couple more questions [100:06] all right so that's a tough one [100:07] someone's asking about aggression with [100:09] certain people or uncertain people so [100:12] what i think you mean is [100:14] it's um [100:15] aggression that the dog is demonstrating [100:18] to people [100:19] where there are no signs that the dog is [100:22] going to be aggressive [100:24] i think that's what you mean [100:26] i'm not [100:27] completely sure but [100:29] sometimes you can have a dog that may be [100:31] aggressive to certain people and not [100:33] aggressive to other people a lot of [100:35] times it could be maybe [100:38] a past experience not always the case [100:40] though because that's something that [100:42] every dog trainer if you're a dog [100:44] trainer and you're watching this you can [100:46] agree i'm sure [100:48] there's been more than one occasions [100:50] where somebody has told me that the [100:52] issues that they think their dog is [100:54] having is due to [100:55] being abused just because a dog has fear [100:58] issues or does certain behaviors doesn't [101:00] always mean that they've been abused [101:03] but sometimes it can mean that like if a [101:05] dog is aggressive has selective [101:08] aggression towards certain people it [101:10] could be because of a past experience [101:12] another great example was in that book i [101:14] was talking about earlier for the love [101:16] of a dog [101:17] there was this golden retriever she's [101:19] talking about in the book i don't [101:20] remember the name of the golden [101:21] retriever but [101:23] it was a family dog they never had any [101:26] issues very sweet loving golden [101:28] retriever and the family went on [101:30] vacation they asked one of their friends [101:32] if they could watch the dogs they said [101:34] no problem they'll watch the dog they [101:36] had a 12 year old son and that 12 year [101:38] old son was teasing the dog i think that [101:42] the [101:42] sun was like pulling the dog's fur [101:45] messing around with the dog the kid [101:46] thought it was funny and it affected the [101:49] dog and then after that that dog was [101:51] becoming reactive towards men and they [101:54] didn't understand what it was or like [101:56] this dog has always been good with [101:59] people and now the dog is acting out in [102:01] a way that we've never seen before and [102:03] it's directed towards men well it's [102:05] because of the experience that the dog [102:07] went through before so just like people [102:08] can have ptsd dogs can have that as well [102:12] so if i'm working with a dog that is [102:13] unpredictable when it comes to [102:15] aggression [102:16] then that's something where i look at it [102:18] as safety is always priority number one [102:21] if i have a dog that has unpredictable [102:23] aggression towards other dogs [102:25] again i keep the dog away from the other [102:26] dogs i don't think it's worth [102:29] risking another dog's well-being to try [102:31] to you know socialize this dog that [102:35] is [102:36] unpredictably aggressive and more often [102:38] not the behaviors are predictable it's [102:40] just most people aren't good at reading [102:43] certain signs that dogs have [102:45] however if you own a dog and you've [102:47] owned a dog for multiple years and [102:49] you've had multiple dogs throughout your [102:51] life you're probably much better at [102:53] reading these signals than you may give [102:54] yourself credit for [102:56] for example we have dogs that will oh [102:59] yeah and i didn't tell people my email [103:01] address just my name gmail.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 362/841,com put in the subject line [103:08] just write manual in all caps so i can [103:11] see it really easily and i'll send over [103:13] a digital copy of the dog training [103:15] manual chapter 7 covers that [103:17] step-by-step process that i was talking [103:19] about and again that's just for like the [103:20] next 10 minutes if you send me an email [103:22] tomorrow i might still give you a free [103:24] copy but anyways [103:27] and then if the dog is having again bad [103:29] reactions towards people then for me if [103:32] i need to socialize that dog with other [103:34] people i'm going to do it with other dog [103:35] experts just because a lot of people [103:37] don't know how to act towards a dog that [103:40] may be aggressive [103:42] may have certain fear issues issues [103:44] while reacting and some dogs [103:47] will bite for no reason at all in fact i [103:49] talk about this [103:51] in my manual i had a dog that i was [103:53] evaluating and it was a much larger dog [103:56] it was a massive mix [103:58] and i break down how i deal with dogs [104:00] that have fear and aggression issues [104:02] when i do stay in trains with them [104:05] and i'll be honest it is pretty scary [104:07] doing this with a dog that is aggressive [104:08] so this is a larger dog [104:10] she was really aggressive inside her [104:12] crate they dropped her off she was in [104:14] the crate so i hadn't had her out of the [104:15] crate yet and i sat next to her for a [104:17] few hours just getting her comfortable [104:19] seeing me and then what what i did was i [104:22] opened the crate and i let her come out [104:24] i had my phone so i could watch her [104:26] through my phone so i wasn't [104:28] using any direct eye to eye contact [104:30] because that could create aggression if [104:32] you're dealing with a dog that's already [104:34] aggressive and so i was watching the dog [104:35] through the phone she came up to me and [104:37] was she brought her nose right next to [104:40] my leg and was just staring at my leg [104:43] which that was a little stressful [104:45] and i waited there eventually she walked [104:47] away i took her outside i had her [104:49] outside i was able to start working with [104:51] her everything was going great [104:53] i turned away and i started to walk away [104:55] from her and as i was walking away she [104:58] came up to me and she bit my back [105:01] in that situation i knew i pretty much [105:04] had two options [105:06] if i try to continue walking away [105:09] more likely than not she would continue [105:10] to bite the second option was to turn [105:13] around grab her collar and try to [105:14] control her so that's what i did she bit [105:17] me i turned around i grabbed her collar [105:19] she bit my hand and then i held her [105:21] moved her away put the leash back on her [105:23] put her back in the crate everything was [105:25] fine [105:26] once i turned around and grabbed her and [105:28] she bit me and i continued to hold on to [105:30] the caller [105:32] she kind of realized that it wasn't [105:34] going to work and she was doing more of [105:35] what i like to call bluffing i talk [105:37] about this in my manual as well [105:40] and it's where they'll act out certain [105:41] behaviors in order to get a certain [105:43] response from the human and if it [105:45] doesn't go as they had planned then [105:47] usually that behavior goes away so i [105:49] don't know what she was trying to do [105:51] when she bit me [105:52] but when i went to grab her collar and [105:53] she bit my hand she did not bite my hand [105:55] that hard it was a small little mark [105:58] wasn't a big deal at all but it could [106:00] have escalated into something worse [106:03] sorry that's just a random story that i [106:05] started to tell like i said i'll talk [106:07] about dogs forever [106:09] someone else was asking about my email [106:10] again nate shomer gmail.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 363/841,com [106:14] uh serious fetch struggling with border [106:17] collie puppy do you have any advice i've [106:18] tried everything uh okay [106:20] playing fetch with the dog i think [106:22] that's what you're asking [106:24] fetch is great so this is going to be [106:26] the last question that i'm going to ask [106:28] dogs get anxious around my cat and wines [106:31] so the cat one okay i'll talk about that [106:33] one too okay last two questions all [106:36] right so playing fetch i think you're [106:37] asking about teaching your border collie [106:39] to play fetch [106:41] if [106:41] if that's the case what i like to do [106:43] with dogs where i'm tr [106:44] not every dog is going to play fetch but [106:46] if the dog does have toy drive if the [106:48] dog enjoys playing with toys then more [106:51] often than not you can teach the dog [106:52] fetch i should probably make a video on [106:54] this as well [106:56] you want to have two people for this it [106:57] helps with the exercise you have one [107:00] person holding the dog have the dog on a [107:03] harness or an agitation collar again an [107:07] agitation collar is a really really [107:08] thick collar that the dog wears so they [107:11] can pull without putting too much [107:13] pressure on their neck since it [107:15] distributes the pressure [107:16] you have someone holding the dog and [107:18] then you have the other person having [107:20] either the um like a ball on a rope the [107:24] flirt poles were great for this and then [107:26] what you do is you tease the dog the [107:29] other person that's holding the dog i'm [107:30] gonna try to explain this well you have [107:31] one person teasing with the flirt pull [107:33] one person holding the dog [107:36] with the harness or the agitation collar [107:38] as you're teasing with the flirt pole [107:40] when the dog becomes excited the person [107:42] that's holding the dog allows the dog to [107:45] pull [107:46] towards the toy very slowly so the dog's [107:49] pulling and you're kind of going with [107:50] the dog as the dog's point once the dog [107:53] gets to the toy [107:54] then you keep the toy active in the [107:56] dog's mouth by using the flirt pull you [107:58] just do little tugs like this just to [108:00] keep the toy active so the dog wants to [108:02] hold the toy [108:03] then you and the other person i like to [108:05] call this a victory lap you have the dog [108:08] run in a circle so the person that's [108:09] holding the dog with the harness they [108:11] run in a circle and then the other [108:12] person runs while keeping the toy active [108:15] with the flirt pull you run in a circle [108:17] and you go to where you want the dog to [108:18] bring the toy once you get to that point [108:22] then the person handling the dog as long [108:24] as it's a friendly dog it's a puppy so [108:26] shouldn't be an issue pick the puppy up [108:28] from the back end that'll get your puppy [108:30] to naturally drop the item you don't [108:32] want to pull it away from the dog [108:34] because that could create more problems [108:36] but by lifting up their back end i do it [108:38] in the video on how to teach your dog to [108:40] bark i did it with harley and she was [108:42] about a year a little over a year at [108:44] that point and no issues pick up the [108:47] back end that gets them to drop the item [108:49] once the puppy drops the item pull it [108:52] away from the dog using the flirt pole [108:54] and then you go out into the field where [108:56] you would throw the toy and then you [108:57] have the person drag back in as you're [109:00] teasing the dog with the toy once they [109:02] get to it same thing you keep it active [109:04] in their mouth you do the victory lap [109:05] and you bring the dog back to where you [109:07] would throw the toy you continue this up [109:09] until the point where the dog has it [109:12] teaches a dog to want to get the toy and [109:14] want to possess the toy which is part of [109:17] playing fetch and those of you that have [109:19] a dog where you throw the ball they'll [109:21] chase the ball they'll grab it and then [109:23] they'll drop it right away you know what [109:25] i'm talking about you're like great i [109:26] could play fetch [109:28] but my dog doesn't bring the ball back [109:30] he grabs the ball sets it down and now i [109:33] have to walk over and get the toy so [109:36] this helps with that as well like i said [109:38] i need to make a video on it so it's a [109:40] little easier to understand explaining [109:42] it is kind of difficult [109:43] but i think you can kind of get the idea [109:46] i hope off of that explanation [109:48] i forgot what the other question was [109:52] someone said you're crazy man i guess i [109:54] can be if you mean with dogs [109:57] how do you not stress the freak out when [109:59] that happens [110:00] oh with the biting you're talking about [110:02] yeah yeah i mean [110:03] oh i've been bitten a couple times if [110:05] you're thinking of becoming a dog [110:07] trainer if you're going to become a [110:08] professional dog trainer [110:10] that's part of the risk of the job being [110:13] bitten i've been bitten a few times [110:15] it's never fun [110:17] you are [110:19] you you it happens less and less the [110:21] better you are as a dog trainer but [110:23] sometimes it could just happen i'll give [110:25] you guys one last quick little story [110:28] i was working with a dog that was [110:30] fearful [110:32] i taught the dog [110:33] how to follow a lure i started to teach [110:35] the dog leash pressure the same way i do [110:37] in my videos i apply the pressure first [110:40] then i lure the dog into the position [110:42] turn off the pressure give the dog the [110:43] food so when done correctly there's [110:45] almost no stress associated with the [110:47] training [110:48] so i was doing that with the dog when i [110:50] first started teaching leash pressure [110:52] with the dog i get down at the dog's [110:54] level i don't stand over them because [110:56] i'm trying to alleviate any additional [110:58] pressure i want to make it as easy as [111:00] possible for the dog [111:02] also with dogs that are fearful i'll lay [111:04] down on the ground where they're more [111:07] towards my feet and i'm farther away [111:09] from them again to remove as much [111:11] pressure as possible [111:13] i'll take the leash i'll slide it under [111:14] my foot and then i'll start to use my [111:17] hand to pull once the dog feels the [111:18] pressure i'll use the food again to lure [111:21] the dog into the position [111:23] turn off the pressure give the dog the [111:25] food [111:25] well for some reason once i started [111:27] applying downward pressure on this dog [111:30] he or she i don't remember decided to [111:32] stop following the lure i was able to do [111:34] it for the sit i was able to do it to [111:36] get the dog to walk forward but once i [111:39] started to apply the downward pressure [111:40] the dog did not want to follow the food [111:42] the dog didn't want to budge [111:44] so [111:45] this was an in-person lesson i told the [111:47] person i'm like well unfortunately we [111:48] just have to wait we have to wait until [111:51] she lays down so i didn't add any [111:53] additional pressure i just stepped there [111:55] i stayed there and we hung out and we [111:57] chatted for a little bit i was answering [111:58] questions that she had about dogs [112:01] and about five minutes later [112:04] the dog did what i called a hail mary [112:07] she started to jump up she she didn't [112:09] want that pressure anymore and it wasn't [112:11] very hard it was very light and then she [112:13] bit my leg about three times as i had [112:16] the leash there and i was wearing shorts [112:19] i always wear shorts so i was i had the [112:22] pressure she bit my leg about three [112:24] times and i just kept it there i just [112:26] waited i didn't react i just waited and [112:30] then after that [112:31] she realized the biting didn't work so [112:33] she stopped biting me and then she laid [112:35] down once she laid down i turned off the [112:37] pressure i was like good girl nice job [112:39] or good boy and then we were good [112:42] we were good no more issues after that i [112:44] was able to get her to follow the lure [112:45] follow the leash pressure everything was [112:47] great [112:48] now if i had released the pressure [112:52] when she bit my leg [112:54] then i would have taught her that biting [112:57] will prevent her from having to complete [112:59] the task [113:00] and that's what i told the owner [113:02] i had allowed that biting to work i [113:04] would have been doing you a huge [113:06] disservice [113:07] i had to take the bites it was a small [113:09] dog so the bites weren't that bad but [113:11] again once she stopped and then she laid [113:13] down i turned off the pressure and [113:15] rewarded her i was able to show her like [113:17] look i'm not against you we're on the [113:19] same team i'm working with you towards a [113:22] common goal and after that it was [113:24] amazing no more issues at all but yeah i [113:27] mean sometimes if you're going to be a [113:28] professional dog trainer getting bit [113:30] could be part of the risk [113:32] someone else asks what's uh my option on [113:35] a raw diet i feed my dogs a raw diet i [113:38] think it's the best way to go [113:40] i've had a lot of clients that have had [113:43] issues with their dogs health issues [113:45] like they had [113:46] excuse me they had skin issues [113:49] and they were put on different types of [113:51] diets all these other diets were not [113:54] working [113:55] and we put the dogs on a raw diet and [113:57] almost every single time they were [113:59] switched to a raw diet a lot of the [114:00] issues went away now i'm not a [114:03] nutritional expert when it comes to dogs [114:06] i've done some studying on it i really [114:08] like uh i believe her name is dr rhonda [114:12] or uh [114:13] i'm drawing a blank right now [114:15] let me see i think it's [114:21] uh oh no all right so i'm thinking of [114:23] someone else [114:28] i was gonna say dr rhonda patrick but [114:30] that's a different doctor [114:33] um [114:40] all right let me see [114:43] okay [114:44] dr karen becker okay i don't know why i [114:46] was drawing a blank on that dr karen [114:48] becker i really like her she has some [114:50] really great videos [114:52] one if you look up best and worst dog [114:54] foods she breaks down what she believes [114:56] is the best and worst and she's an [114:58] expert in that field so i watch her [115:00] videos i study the stuff that she puts [115:02] out there's a documentary on food for [115:05] dogs that i recommend to people it's [115:07] called pet food [115:09] f-o-o-l-e-d [115:10] pet food [115:12] if you have a dog i recommend checking [115:14] out that video [115:15] now with the raw my dogs are on a [115:18] pre-made raw dog food i switched them [115:21] through different brands so i've used [115:24] steves on them i've used [115:27] small batch [115:29] tuckers [115:30] there's different brands i i buy the [115:32] pre-made raw ones simply because if [115:35] you're going to prepare the raw dog food [115:37] yourself [115:38] then you really have to make sure you [115:40] know what you're doing because if you [115:41] prepare it yourself [115:43] it could be [115:45] the worst or best thing you feed your [115:47] dog according to [115:50] um [115:52] dr becker so [115:54] all right i think that answers that [115:57] i would check out her videos [115:59] does your training work for pitbulls the [116:01] the training works for every breed every [116:04] breed the process works if you do it [116:06] correctly again i talked about it on my [116:08] myth video not every dog is trainable [116:11] but that's a very very small percentage [116:13] we're talking point zero zero zero zero [116:15] zero zero one percent [116:17] might not be trainable but [116:19] ninety nine point nine nine nine nine [116:21] percent of the dogs out there are [116:22] trainable and the process that i teach [116:24] works on all the dogs now that doesn't [116:27] mean that it's the only process for [116:29] training dogs [116:30] i've done uh [116:32] actually [116:33] let me rephrase that i've had a couple [116:35] friends of mine go through [116:38] nepopo [116:39] training which is negative positive [116:41] positive any dog trainers watching you [116:43] may be aware of what i'm talking about [116:45] nipopo was developed by bart bellen and [116:48] that's a different style of training [116:50] that is supposed to be really really [116:52] good like i said some of my dog trainer [116:54] friends have told me a little bit about [116:56] it [116:57] but [116:58] i haven't personally taken any of his [117:00] seminars but bart belen if you look him [117:02] up b-e-r-t [117:03] b-a-l-l-o-n i think or b-e-l-l-o-n [117:07] unbelievable dog trainer i mean his dogs [117:10] are incredible [117:11] another really good one is [117:14] um [117:15] dog training without conflict i want to [117:17] take this guy's course too ivan bella [117:20] bonoff some of you might be familiar [117:21] with him [117:23] another incredible dog trainer we're [117:24] talking he wins titles [117:27] on a regular [117:28] uh [117:30] just [117:31] i think he's won the world championship [117:34] three times or maybe four times and [117:36] schutzen incredible dog trainer so there [117:38] are different styles out there but again [117:41] this dog training without conflict [117:43] another great course that some of my [117:45] friends have done and they've told me [117:46] about i need to do it myself all right [117:48] but anyways i think that's good for [117:50] today someone asked what belt i am in [117:52] jiu-jitsu i'm a really really good blue [117:55] belt [117:56] so i've been doing it for about three [117:57] and a half years but with jiu jitsu i've [118:00] transferred to many different schools so [118:03] i've trained at um i started at a gracie [118:07] gym then i did 10th planet jiu jitsu in [118:09] san diego under pj barch

excelled and [00:31] graduated with honors his education [00:34] didn't stop there as he traveled to [00:36] another school in brazil to focus on [00:38] training aggressive dogs before becoming

dave [01:24] van garderin [01:26] thanks for joining us on another episode [01:28] today i am here with dave van gaardran [01:31] professional dog trainer at kennel wood [01:33] academy in missouri and today we're [01:35] going to be talking about becoming a [01:37] professional dog trainer first thanks so [01:39] much for being on the show i really [01:40] appreciate it thanks for having me i [01:42] appreciate it so the first question and [01:44] something that a lot of people are very [01:46] curious about is what is the steps that [01:48] somebody needs to take if they are [01:50] interested in becoming a professional [01:52] dog trainer what are the routes that [01:54] will help give someone the highest [01:56] chances of being successful within that [01:58] industry [02:00] well that's a good question there are a [02:02] couple different ways um you could [02:04] apprentice for someone [02:06] but the kind of the fast track and the [02:09] best way to get a very well-rounded [02:12] education is to come through a dog [02:15] training school um here at kendall wood [02:17] academy we teach a really broad spectrum [02:20] of dog training and our goal is through [02:24] that broad spectrum of dog training is [02:26] to teach our students how dogs think and [02:29] learn so that they can eventually teach [02:32] things that we didn't even teach them to [02:33] do so we'll do things like specific odor [02:36] detection agility protection work [02:40] tracking search and rescue [02:42] um [02:44] all kinds of different areas of dog [02:45] training so that they really get an [02:47] overall broad spectrum of how dogs think [02:50] and learn [02:51] right and that's a good point just [02:53] because somebody is going to be let's [02:55] say primarily focused on obedience or [02:57] pet training learning what you said [03:00] scent detection search and rescue [03:02] tracking these things have a huge impact [03:04] because number one they're having a [03:07] wider understanding of dogs and dog [03:09] training but number two which i think is [03:11] even more important is the ability to be [03:13] able to read a dog and that's where it [03:16] comes down to i think you can correct me [03:18] if i'm wrong but the art of dog training [03:20] of course the science when we're looking [03:23] at it i always tell people the science [03:24] is always the same well what separates [03:27] it is the the [03:28] different personality traits the dog's [03:30] motivation their perseverance and being [03:33] able to read that so doing all those [03:35] different things you know at least for [03:37] me it helped me a great deal when i was [03:39] learning to become a professional dog [03:41] trainer and i've mentioned you before on [03:43] my channel and told people that i had an [03:45] opportunity to learn from you in fact [03:47] you were one of my first mentors when i [03:49] was becoming a professional dog trainer [03:51] and something i noticed with you because [03:54] of course we want to be like our leaders [03:56] our teachers our instructors [03:58] your ability to work throughout the day [04:00] non-stop i mean during lunch you're [04:03] training dogs you're working protection [04:05] i remember you'd always tell me like hey [04:06] go get that dog we're doing some [04:08] protection training [04:09] you think that [04:10] passion that you have is something that [04:12] is necessary for somebody to be [04:14] successful within this industry [04:17] i think it definitely helps i think [04:19] passion for for whatever subject you are [04:21] you know that you're studying is [04:22] definitely going to help um and i think [04:24] it's definitely driven me but i think [04:26] that i think that [04:29] that you can do well um i don't think [04:31] that you have to be a competitive dog [04:33] trainer to do well um [04:35] but [04:37] kind of going back to what you were [04:38] saying earlier of having like [04:40] understanding or learning these [04:42] different subjects [04:45] even if you even if a student isn't [04:47] necessarily interested in protection [04:49] work or developing a protection dog i [04:52] still encourage those students to [04:54] sit in at least on those classes [04:57] because if you learn how to develop [05:00] aggression so to speak then it's going [05:02] to help you learn how to dismantle it in [05:05] a different sense also so kind of you [05:08] know every every behavior kind of has [05:10] two sides of a coin [05:12] and in some cases you want it in some [05:14] cases you don't [05:15] um and so really kind of learning all [05:17] those aspects is really is i think is [05:19] going to be the key to success whether [05:21] people compete or not that's just one [05:23] way to spread your name it's definitely [05:25] not the only way [05:27] behind you you have a few trophies what [05:28] are those from i think some of them [05:30] you've competed nationally as well as [05:33] internationally with schutzen or igp if [05:36] you did akc as well or what other sports [05:38] have you done [05:39] yeah um i've done a lot of akc um [05:42] obedience schutzen igp um you know that [05:46] kind of stuff uh the different names [05:48] that it's constantly changing um i i [05:51] have won a couple of national [05:52] championships in schutzen um i [05:55] competed or went to worlds um in 2011.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 368/841,[05:59] um i've won [06:01] a handful uh or two highest scores in [06:04] the country for psa um so kind of [06:07] mainly [06:08] uh [06:09] as far as the competition side of stuff [06:11] goes akc psa and schutzen is is mainly [06:14] what i've competed in [06:16] so earlier you said that when you're [06:19] training a protection dog in a sense [06:20] it's developing aggression can you [06:22] define what you mean by that because of [06:24] course just because a dog's trained in [06:26] protection or a protection sport doesn't [06:29] necessarily mean that the dog's [06:31] aggressive but rather the behavior that [06:34] we're teaching them may appear to be [06:36] aggressive or the act of being [06:37] aggressive just like maybe a martial art [06:40] expert they're not an aggressive person [06:42] but they're learning certain skill sets [06:45] yes yeah and that and that's that is a [06:47] really good point to [06:48] kind of put out there and to separate um [06:51] not every dog that does protection [06:53] sports is actually gonna bite somebody [06:55] or even has the ability to bite somebody [06:57] um but some of these dogs definitely do [07:00] uh and that just depends on the person [07:02] if they want to go that route or not um [07:05] but when we do go that route and we do [07:07] make a serious protection dog like a [07:09] personal protection dog for example or a [07:11] dog for the police department that is [07:14] actually going to bite somebody when we [07:16] learn how to do that then we can also [07:19] learn how to [07:21] kind of reverse that process with dogs [07:24] that are biting people or that are that [07:26] are being aggressive when they're not [07:28] supposed to be and it could also do the [07:31] opposite as well teaching them to be [07:33] more calm and relaxed because it builds [07:35] up the confidence it makes me think of [07:36] something that bart belen said where he [07:38] goes if you teach a dog to come to you [07:40] you have to teach a dog to go away from [07:42] you whenever you teach the dogs the kind [07:44] of what i was saying is that those two [07:45] sides to the coin to each behavior you [07:48] know you have you have the [07:50] the in that case the recall and then the [07:52] going away [07:54] so same thing with aggression being able [07:55] to turn it on and off [07:57] whether it's you know like actual act of [08:00] aggression or if it's just a taut [08:01] behavior [08:02] and something you said earlier was you [08:04] encourage the students to at least watch [08:06] during the protection training so i'm [08:08] assuming that the protection portion of [08:10] the school is not one of the [08:12] requirements in order to graduate [08:14] correct the protection is an elective so [08:17] we tend to do it near the end of the day [08:19] um [08:20] and [08:21] we we work through the any student dogs [08:24] that they have whether they're puppies [08:26] or adults and then we also encourage our [08:28] students to come to our club which is on [08:32] saturday so in essence our students if [08:34] they if they want it they're getting six [08:36] days a week of education [08:38] that's awesome i mean that's amazing and [08:41] like we were saying earlier being able [08:42] to do these different aspects within dog [08:45] training i think helps make somebody a [08:47] better dog trainer now somebody who's [08:49] interested in coming down to the school [08:51] because i have people constantly asking [08:52] me what schools do i recommend for [08:55] somebody to become a professional dog [08:57] trainer and of course you guys are on [08:58] top of that list what's something that [09:01] someone should do in order to prepare [09:04] would you say there's certain books [09:05] maybe that they should read maybe they [09:07] should practice certain things with [09:08] their dog or coming down clean slate is [09:11] the best option [09:12] i really think coming down clean slates [09:14] is typically the best option um [09:17] although people that have experience can [09:20] do and do very well it really comes down [09:23] to the person's how open-minded they are [09:27] um i've had students that have a lot of [09:29] prior experience that were professionals [09:31] before they they had their own dog [09:33] training businesses before they came [09:34] through school [09:35] and because of how open-minded they were [09:37] they did really really well [09:39] but i've also had the opposite where [09:41] people were already dog trainers they [09:43] come through school and they already [09:45] kind of know that the things that they [09:47] have done in the past worked so that [09:49] kind of closes them off of [09:51] new ideas theories and methods and then [09:53] they just kind of get stuck in that box [09:55] and they never really learn anything [09:56] more than they came in with [09:58] yeah and that's something that could [10:00] puts anybody in a stop within their [10:02] career i mean one of my favorite quotes [10:04] i'm not sure if you're familiar with [10:06] socrates but he said i study other [10:08] philosophers like a spy in the enemies [10:11] camp so it doesn't matter how long [10:14] you've been a professional within your [10:16] industry we constantly have to continue [10:18] to learn to be open-minded to learn [10:21] different techniques and strategies that [10:23] not only will make us better as trainers [10:25] but it will do more value to the dogs in [10:28] which we're training and the people that [10:29] we're helping i mean yeah you couldn't [10:31] have said it any better it goes right [10:33] back to what you were saying before in [10:35] that that dog training is science [10:38] and art because i can tell my students [10:42] all day long and talk about science of [10:44] dog training but that doesn't teach them [10:46] how to teach a sit [10:48] like after i teach them all the science [10:50] they still don't know how this is how [10:52] i'm going to go teach a sitter this is [10:53] how i'm going to go teach competitive [10:55] healing or this is how i'm going to go [10:56] track so it's really like the science [10:59] like you said never changes but the art [11:01] of it and how we apply that science is [11:04] constantly changing [11:06] and [11:07] if you're not adapting in the dog [11:08] training world then you're gonna get [11:10] left behind super quick [11:12] absolutely it's one of those industries [11:13] that is constantly progressing i mean uh [11:17] a dog trainer that i've studied and i've [11:19] always been a fan of has been michael [11:21] ellis and in one of his videos he even [11:24] says look at videos from 30 40 years ago [11:27] of dogs doing competitive obedience and [11:29] look at them now [11:30] it's a completely different animal how [11:33] much the industry has evolved now if you [11:35] don't mind can you take a minute and [11:37] tell me how the school is structured [11:39] what would somebody expect when they [11:41] come down to the school of course [11:43] anytime we're doing something new at [11:45] least for me i try not to show it but [11:47] i'm always super nervous going to a new [11:49] school super nervous doing the [11:51] competition super nervous [11:53] what are some things that you could tell [11:55] them that would either make it a little [11:57] bit easier for them or give them that [11:58] peace of mind of knowing what they're [12:00] stepping into well i i always recommend [12:02] if students can to come out and do a [12:04] tour that way they can they come out we [12:06] show them around [12:08] they get to meet the staff they get to [12:10] see where they're going to be in school [12:12] um they get to kind of like look at the [12:14] like where they're going to be staying [12:15] and stuff like that if they choose to [12:16] stay in student housing um and that [12:18] really alleviates a lot of pressure um [12:21] we also have um a few like move-in days [12:25] before we even get started so it the [12:27] whole kind of like getting to the part [12:29] where we're actually learning um or like [12:32] you know [12:33] working with the dogs and stuff is gonna [12:35] take a little bit so there isn't it's [12:36] not high pressure um [12:39] and we move along we move along pretty [12:41] pretty slow in the beginning any time [12:43] that we start teaching something like we [12:45] introduce something new um we have a [12:47] pretty pretty pretty lengthy process [12:49] that we go through so we're going to [12:51] start off with like teaching a [12:53] lecture [12:54] um kind of just talking about and [12:57] explaining what we are going to be doing [13:00] then we will watch a video on a dog [13:03] doing whatever it is [13:05] then we will add in [13:07] one of our dogs one of our personal dogs [13:09] will show what it should look like [13:12] things to look out for things to do what [13:14] not to do then we'll get a puppy out [13:16] from one of the students we'll demo it [13:18] with a puppy that has never done this [13:20] before and then we'll go through each [13:22] individual student and work those dogs [13:25] individually once everybody kind of has [13:27] an idea of what it is whatever we're [13:29] teaching then we move on to being able [13:31] to do it kind of as a class and as with [13:33] more distractions and stuff like that [13:36] i like that you go through each puppy at [13:38] a time so when one puppy comes out that [13:41] student is participating with one of the [13:43] instructors yourself or one of the other [13:45] ones and then the rest of the students [13:47] i'm assuming are observing what's going [13:49] on with the training yeah and yeah we [13:51] find that that really helps because each [13:53] student like as you know you know every [13:55] stu every dog is a little bit different [13:58] and especially in the introduction [13:59] phases that's where things are so so [14:02] critical so having each student watch [14:04] every other student's dog in the [14:06] introduction phase can really bring a [14:08] lot of extra learning to the table [14:11] rather than everybody just trying to do [14:12] it themselves at the same time and that [14:15] also puts a lot more distractions in the [14:17] training building [14:18] yeah and i couldn't agree more i mean [14:20] being able to see the other dogs that's [14:22] going to help develop the art side of [14:24] becoming a professional dog trainer yeah [14:27] yeah i mean it's [14:28] it really it really like you said it [14:30] comes down to experience and having seen [14:33] it so many times before that you see it [14:36] coming before it happens and therein [14:39] lies you know the expert's timing is so [14:42] much better than the beginners [14:44] because you know [14:45] someone that has 20 years of experience [14:48] watching a new trainer can mark a [14:50] behavior four times before the new [14:52] trainer does and that really is gonna [14:54] you know slow down learning [14:56] now you said that uh you watch the video [14:59] you go through the lecture watch the [15:00] video then this then you demonstrate [15:02] with one of your dogs or one of the [15:04] other instructors dogs then you work [15:05] each puppy [15:06] then the students as a group start [15:08] training their dogs individually or what [15:10] takes place after that for a certain [15:12] exercise you'd be working on yeah then [15:14] then they then they work them [15:15] individually for a certain amount of [15:17] time just kind of depending on the dogs [15:19] and the individuals how quick they all [15:21] catch on and stuff and then when they're [15:23] ready then we start adding in you know [15:25] more [15:27] students and dogs at the same time [15:30] and do they have an opportunity to work [15:32] with clients as well because kennelwood [15:34] of course is also a dog training [15:37] business aside from the school portion [15:40] so do they have a chance to work with [15:42] clients from the dog training [15:45] portion yeah that's a really good [15:47] question and uh yeah kennel wood pet [15:49] resorts our parent company actually has [15:51] eight other locations one of those [15:54] locations holds 500 dogs itself [15:57] so you know we really encourage our [15:59] students to to look for and we'll help [16:02] them find the best puppies to bring [16:04] through the program that are able to do [16:06] all of those different things that we're [16:08] talking about [16:10] and then they'll get experience with [16:11] dogs that don't want to eat that are [16:13] aggressive that are dog aggressive that [16:16] are reactive [16:17] that don't like people [16:20] you know all these problem type of dogs [16:22] and pets we have eight locations that we [16:25] go to [16:26] with our students and each one of those [16:28] locations has two or three professional [16:30] trainers and so there's a lot to be [16:32] learned like right there um in those [16:35] locations [16:37] and that's something that we often say [16:39] as dog trainers training pets is the [16:41] bread and butter often of many dog [16:43] training businesses so i could see that [16:46] being incredibly valuable [16:48] it really is it really gets them ready [16:51] for it really gets them job ready you [16:53] know they really are ready to hit the [16:55] ground running and start training dogs [16:57] so the program really does kind of all [17:00] around um get them ready for the job [17:02] market and something that does separate [17:04] somebody trying to learn by watching [17:07] videos maybe doing some online courses [17:10] in comparison to coming in and seeing it [17:13] in person [17:14] i'm guilty of it myself i try not to do [17:16] this in my videos but often we cut out [17:19] some of the mistakes that maybe the dog [17:21] makes because we don't want to show that [17:24] but when you're seeing it in person [17:25] there is no hiding covering anything [17:27] they see the entire process which of [17:30] course in my opinion is going to make [17:32] them more successful especially right [17:34] off in the beginning would you agree 100 [17:36] i mean all of the all of the you know [17:38] the social media videos they tend to be [17:42] what we all [17:43] strive for you know that is like that's [17:46] the goal of what we show that's the goal [17:48] um we don't typically tend to show all [17:51] of the things that happen to get there [17:53] and therein lies the learning for the [17:55] dog and for us and the students [17:58] what would you say is probably one of [18:00] the most common mistakes [18:03] that a new student makes when they come [18:05] down to the school [18:07] most common mistake that a student makes [18:08] when they come down to the school [18:10] um [18:11] i would say probably [18:15] going a lot of students think that they [18:17] should have a puppy or they need a dog [18:20] to come to dog training school and [18:21] although yeah you do need a dog to come [18:23] to dog training school um we want the [18:26] right dog um and not any dog can become [18:29] a protection dog not any dog as you know [18:32] can become a service dog [18:34] um so if we're looking for [18:36] dogs or puppies that are gonna fill all [18:39] these categories you know protection [18:42] tracking obedience [18:44] um agility [18:45] uh you know all that kind of stuff then [18:48] we need like really specific dogs that [18:51] can do though that can fill all of those [18:54] uh you know all those boxes um and so [18:57] like i said you know we want to find the [18:59] best puppies or the best dogs for the [19:00] students so they can have very versatile [19:03] dogs that can fill all those [19:04] requirements and then we'll get them [19:06] experienced with those not so great dogs [19:09] that want to bite and that don't want to [19:11] eat and that are aggressive and reactive [19:14] in our other locations [19:17] so coming through like i said you know [19:19] with a blank slate um and with [19:23] ideally no dogs or with a dog that you [19:26] know doesn't have a whole lot of [19:27] training but is has a very low level of [19:29] fear and really high level of drives are [19:31] ideal [19:33] and if a student comes down without a [19:35] personal dog yet the instructors help [19:37] find and identify the right dog for the [19:39] program definitely yeah um we have a lot [19:42] of lectures in the in the first few [19:44] weeks on picking the right breed the [19:47] right um [19:48] dog for you and then to set you up for [19:50] the for the success in the program but [19:52] also for success after you graduate that [19:55] way the students have the right breed [19:58] the right temperament and the right [20:00] drives to you know go do whatever it is [20:03] that they're wanting to do when they [20:04] graduate and that's an important note [20:07] for people that want to train their own [20:09] service dog or train a therapy dog or [20:12] something like that i mean myself i'm [20:14] guilty of it when i first came down to [20:17] learn to be become a dog trainer my [20:19] thought process was you could train any [20:21] dog to do this any dog has the ability [20:24] and unfortunately that's simply not the [20:26] case not every dog can do protection [20:29] work not every dog could be a service [20:31] dog not every dog can be a competition [20:33] obedience dog when you are looking to [20:36] select a puppy for [20:38] working purposes regardless of what it [20:40] is what are some of the characteristic [20:42] traits that you are trying to identify [20:45] well that yet like you said you know it [20:47] does depend on what you're looking for [20:49] typically for the school for puppies [20:51] that are coming through the school or [20:52] dogs that are coming through the school [20:54] um because we have such a broad spectrum [20:57] of you know behaviors that we're going [21:00] to be teaching these dogs um we tend to [21:02] look for [21:03] really low fear so dogs that aren't [21:05] don't get scared quickly of you know [21:07] something dropping on the ground or [21:09] something different in the room that [21:11] they're not used to [21:12] dogs are just self-confident [21:15] um drive is something also that we look [21:18] for so food drive a dog that will want [21:20] to eat all the time ideally even when [21:22] they're not hungry so think of like a [21:24] lab a lot of labs kind of tend to be [21:26] like that [21:27] um [21:28] and then pray drive you know the dogs [21:30] desire to play with a ball or a bite or [21:32] rag or something like that [21:34] um then we can look at compliancy um [21:37] kind of how eager to please they are so [21:40] to speak [21:41] um [21:42] and so there's a lot of different kind [21:44] of traits like that that we're looking [21:45] for but the main ones would be low fear [21:48] and high drive [21:50] yeah and of course the high drive [21:51] because that's a motivational tool that [21:53] you can use to get the dog to do certain [21:56] behaviors right the more they want [21:59] something that we have the more they're [22:01] willing to work for it and contrary to [22:03] popular belief dogs don't do things just [22:06] to make us happy as a lot of people [22:08] think now as you say sometimes some dogs [22:10] do i mean of course you got those labs [22:12] or golden retrievers or certain breeds [22:14] that just want to be around they're [22:16] human but of course we need to have some [22:18] sort of motivating factor to get our [22:20] dogs to do certain behaviors which makes [22:23] me think of a very common question and [22:25] this doesn't necessarily pertain to [22:26] becoming a professional dog trainer but [22:28] it does of course deal with training [22:30] dogs people often say i want my dog to [22:33] perform just because i tell them to i [22:35] don't want to have to give my dog treats [22:37] or food or something like that what is [22:39] your advice when somebody has that sort [22:42] of mindset in the beginning [22:44] um i i mean it's [22:46] it's understandable um i think that you [22:48] know [22:50] i probably at one point was hoping for [22:52] that as well [22:54] but as we as we like you said as we [22:56] start to kind of understand dogs and we [22:59] look at the science behind things um [23:03] everybody everything every being [23:05] including humans only do things for a [23:07] reason uh there has to be motivation [23:09] behind it that's why we go to work um [23:12] that's why we don't speed um and so you [23:15] know learning how to apply all of our [23:18] four quadrants of dog training is is i [23:20] think imperative um if we kind of cut [23:23] ourselves into just [23:25] one box or two boxes then [23:28] um we really get to the point where [23:31] it's kind of like playing that remember [23:33] that hot and cold game that you used to [23:35] play as a kid where you're like say hot [23:37] as you're getting closer and cold as [23:38] you're getting farther [23:40] it's kind of like that but you can only [23:42] say hot like how much harder is that [23:44] game [23:45] if you can only use one motivation type [23:48] so that's that's a perfect analogy now [23:51] if you you if you can use two [23:53] motivations i'm gonna get you there [23:54] twice as quick as if i can only say hot [23:57] or if i can only say cold [23:59] and that brings me to another question [24:01] so the school teaches [24:03] balance dog training and if we look at [24:05] it there's traditional which is [24:08] primarily based on just corrections [24:10] there's pure positive which is primarily [24:12] based on just rewards and then balance [24:14] incorporates both of those and i think [24:17] you already pretty much answered the [24:19] question perfectly by saying it makes it [24:21] way more clear and the dog ends up [24:23] learning faster which [24:26] makes a dog more confident it makes them [24:28] happy it lowers those stress levels [24:30] often people think oh if i do something [24:32] like use any sort of pressure then the [24:35] dog's going to shut down which of course [24:37] can happen to maybe some very very [24:38] sensitive dogs [24:40] well then you use too much pressure [24:41] right and then you didn't do it right [24:43] perfect point and someone does start to [24:45] do that then what is the best option for [24:47] them just take a step back a lot of [24:49] times if we use pressure too soon with [24:51] like a weak weaker-minded dog then [24:54] they'll shut down because they don't [24:55] know how they don't understand the [24:57] pressure the exact same thing will [24:59] happen to a stronger dog if we way over [25:02] pressure that dog that's that's then the [25:04] trainer using too much pressure the [25:06] pressure isn't the issue it's the amount [25:08] of pressure that's the issue [25:10] you know a tire needs a certain amount [25:12] of pressure if we over inflate it's not [25:14] going to be able to handle that pressure [25:15] it's going to blow up [25:16] now something i meant to ask [25:19] i had a protection specialist on [25:22] my last episode and of course you're a [25:23] protection specialist as well within dog [25:26] training and i meant to ask this so i [25:28] get to ask you now which is great when [25:30] people are watching protection sports if [25:32] they don't know very much about it you [25:33] can see that the dogs are hit with [25:35] clatter sticks or batons and things like [25:38] that during the training and of course [25:40] they're not hitting the dog very hard [25:42] however there is value within that as [25:45] far as the training and it made me think [25:47] of something i don't know if you've seen [25:49] this footage but there's a video i think [25:51] it's on the front lawn of the white [25:53] house from years ago and the dog runs up [25:56] to somebody who's in the property that [25:58] shouldn't be there and the person kicked [26:00] the dog and the dog ran away [26:02] so that right there shows part of a [26:05] failure i would say in the training so [26:07] can you explain what the importance is [26:09] of doing things like using clatter [26:10] sticks or using bottle curtains and [26:13] different types of distractions that you [26:14] see in these protection sports yeah it's [26:17] actually not we're actually not using [26:20] them in a way to [26:22] like distract or hurt the dog um it's [26:25] all started as off as a very young puppy [26:28] and it's basically desensitizing the dog [26:31] to this stuff so it all starts off with [26:34] just making those noises clattering [26:37] shaking the can curtain things like that [26:39] and then like giving them the reward on [26:41] the like giving them a rag to play with [26:44] and to bite on and playing tug and that [26:45] kind of thing and then slowly over time [26:48] that pressure is just increased and it's [26:52] it never actually affects them in a [26:55] negative way if you do it if you meter [26:57] the [26:58] the uh pressure with the [27:01] accessories appropriately [27:03] so there it's you know it's just like [27:04] desensitizing a dog to a vacuum cleaner [27:07] um or when hunters desensitize them to [27:10] guns [27:11] um you know dogs are gonna and end up in [27:14] the real world like you know like you [27:16] said with police dogs or military dogs [27:18] they're gonna end up um getting too [27:21] adversives and if they have never [27:24] encountered that before then that's the [27:26] type of thing that's gonna happen [27:27] they're gonna probably you know that [27:29] fight or flight instinct is gonna kick [27:31] in they've never dealt with [27:33] being [27:34] um you know striped with a with a stick [27:36] before and [27:38] they're gonna you know they're gonna [27:39] head out if we [27:41] slowly over a very long period of time [27:44] start tapping them with a stick and [27:46] giving them a reward and building that [27:48] then pretty soon they really don't mind [27:51] being hit um just like martial artists [27:54] don't like being hit just like football [27:57] players don't mind being hit um not ever [28:00] not not all impact is negative [28:03] dogs that do protection work they love [28:05] it they really enjoy it they dogs that [28:08] do protection work for the most part um [28:10] that is their favorite thing that is [28:12] definitely the most favorite thing um [28:15] they're always going to choose [28:16] protection over anything else [28:19] yeah definitely and i have another [28:20] question i was just thinking about as we [28:22] were talking about earlier always trying [28:24] to learn more about dog training i [28:27] started reading a book and one of the [28:28] things that i have an issue with when [28:30] i'm reading other dog trainer books is [28:33] i find myself sometimes getting [28:34] frustrated when i don't necessarily [28:36] agree with what the person's saying in [28:38] the book but i still read it anyways [28:40] because i want to make sure i stay [28:41] open-minded and continue to learn well [28:43] this one that i was reading [28:45] he said that obedience doesn't fix [28:47] behavioral issues but i disagree i think [28:50] obedience often does fix behavioral [28:53] issues now at the school a lot of what [28:56] you're doing is you're teaching [28:57] obedience you're teaching how to train [28:58] the dog to build their confidence how [29:01] does that transfer into [29:03] behavioral modification or fixing [29:06] behavioral issues i mean it's [29:08] with with dog training you're able to or [29:11] with with teaching [29:13] you know traditional obedience you're [29:15] able to [29:16] kind of manage the dog's behaviors a lot [29:18] and in turn they end up learning what [29:21] works and what doesn't work [29:24] and therein a lot of times it ends up [29:26] fixing the [29:27] behavior i thought that was a good one [29:30] though because i mean when i'm working [29:32] with [29:33] dogs and i have them in a stain train [29:36] program i'm doing obedience and people [29:38] are often telling me well my dog does my [29:40] dog runs out the front door well [29:42] obedience is going to help with that [29:44] because i can tell the dog to sit oh are [29:46] you going to teach a weight command i [29:48] don't have to teach a weight command [29:49] what do you want your dog to do while [29:50] they're waiting i'd like them to lay [29:51] down so tell them to down often when [29:54] dogs do behavioral issues it's because [29:55] they haven't been told what to do right [29:59] they don't know what the right behavior [30:01] is [30:01] exactly and when we tell them this is [30:03] what you do in this situation this is [30:05] what you do in that situation they end [30:07] up becoming way more confident i was [30:09] doing an interview with another dog [30:10] trainer about two years ago and she said [30:13] people are always just telling me what [30:14] they don't want their dog to do how [30:16] about telling your dog what you do want [30:18] them to do [30:20] yep [30:21] yep and there we go with those two sides [30:23] of the coin again right yeah absolutely [30:25] and that falls into that obedience [30:28] obedience often does fix behavioral [30:30] issues now if we look at behavioral [30:32] issues i always say that there's five [30:34] main behavioral issues that people have [30:36] to deal with fear aggression destructive [30:39] dangerous or simply behaviors that we [30:42] don't want the dog to perform are there [30:44] any other ones that i may be missing [30:47] no i don't think so but i think with i [30:50] think for most for most people [30:53] um [30:55] you really can kind of solve most things [30:58] with just teaching three behaviors [31:00] and that would be walking on a leash [31:03] a climb or a place command you know [31:05] where they stay up onto something and [31:07] just remain there and then coming when [31:09] called [31:11] you know i think with with those three [31:13] things most people are going to be able [31:15] to manage their dogs pretty well and [31:16] then from there on out everything else [31:18] is just cherries on the top [31:20] but i agree uh you know manage [31:22] management is is kind of where i think [31:24] the most of the general public falls a [31:26] little bit short [31:28] so do you have any advice for somebody [31:30] who is [31:31] maybe they're not going to become a dog [31:32] trainer but they do want to do advanced [31:35] type of obedience with their dog whether [31:36] they want to do herding [31:38] they want to join a local protection [31:40] club do akc obedience scent detection [31:42] and they're getting a brand new puppy [31:44] what advice would you give to them as [31:46] far as what should they be doing with [31:48] that brand new puppy to help that dog [31:50] become successful with whatever sort of [31:53] endeavors that they have for that dog [31:55] that's a that's a really good question [31:57] the best thing to do is before you get [31:59] the puppy [32:00] go to a competition of what you're [32:03] interested in so whether it's lure [32:04] coursing schutzen psa doc diving frisbee [32:09] whatever it is [32:10] go out there [32:12] watch the competition talk to people [32:15] that are doing well in the competition [32:17] and then from there you're gonna figure [32:18] out where you should get your dog and [32:21] then at that point when you have your [32:23] puppy start looking at um or maybe even [32:26] before a puppy before you get the puppy [32:28] start looking at uh joining a club that [32:30] is [32:31] either does that sport or [32:34] um at least you know spent like maybe [32:36] specializes in that sport or at least [32:38] does it [32:39] awesome and last question for those out [32:42] there that want to become a professional [32:44] dog trainer but they simply don't have [32:46] the money at this point to go to a [32:48] school and to learn from a professional [32:50] like yourself what advice could you give [32:52] them as far as getting started in that [32:55] journey of being a professional dog [32:58] trainer i would probably say going back [33:00] to um you know [33:01] looking at apprenticeships or following [33:04] you know your channel on youtube [33:07] or even maybe a local shelter or a [33:09] rescue or something like that [33:11] yeah yep you know going to going and [33:14] getting a job in the industry somewhere [33:16] is gonna help uh going and working for a [33:19] vet or going working at a kennel or [33:21] whatever um if you're a really good [33:23] employee uh they may even send you to [33:25] our school we have some some employers [33:27] out there that are sending their good [33:29] employees through school [33:31] so that they come back and then they [33:33] have a contract that that trainer will [33:34] work with them for a couple years and so [33:37] then the employer has [33:39] this student that or this you know [33:41] trainer that's going to work for them [33:42] for a couple years they don't have to [33:44] worry about that and the student gets an [33:46] education how can people find you if [33:48] they're interested in coming down to the [33:49] school all of our information is on our [33:51] website kennelwoodacademy.

for going on 11 years his [00:06] journey started with learning the ins [00:07] and outs of positive training at a local [00:09] petsmart that then pushed jacob to [00:12] continue down this journey of learning [00:15] and working with dogs from there jacob [00:17] moved from california to missouri to [00:20] help further his education in the art of [00:22] dog training [00:23] there jacob attended and graduated the [00:26] courses at the tom rose school that [00:28] helped to build a foundation in lots of [00:30] different avenues and dog training he [00:32] had the opportunity to dive in and learn [00:35] about subjects such as detection work [00:38] tracking search and rescue basic to [00:41] advanced obedience and lastly protection [00:44] protection quickly became a passion and [00:47] jake dove into the bite sports scene [00:49] starting with igp and then landing in [00:52] psa protection sport association [00:55] jake has competed in psa both as a decoy [00:58] and competitor he has gone on to decoy [01:01] four psa nationals now he strives to [01:04] achieve titles from both of his malinois [01:07] closing out a level two with one and [01:09] working on getting his level one title [01:11] with another [01:12] he also helps his club members do the [01:14] same as the training director of high [01:17] country working dogs in colorado one of [01:19] jake's most recent accomplishments is [01:22] attending and graduating from the napo [01:24] post silver and gold schools there he [01:27] had the opportunity to work with michael [01:29] and bart bellen to help

service the denver area and beyond [01:45] please welcome jacob placencia [01:48] first thanks for being on the show i [01:50] really appreciate it yeah nate it's [01:52] great to be here man it's great talking [01:53] to you uh love the channel dude love all [01:55] the things you're doing very [01:57] enthusiastic man and i'm happy to be [01:58] here thank you so much and today we're [02:00] going to be talking about the five most [02:03] important commands that everybody should [02:05] be teaching their dogs now with that [02:07] being said what would you say is the [02:08] most important out of the five let's [02:10] start there of course yeah this is a [02:12] very common one and the most [02:14] common request that we get for uh [02:17] helping dogs is [02:19] the come command coming when called [02:22] right by far it's the one that is most [02:25] needed uh i do believe it is the most [02:28] important command because [02:30] when you're out and about in a busy [02:32] place and if your dog somehow slips the [02:33] leash gets out of their collar yanks the [02:36] leash from your hand [02:38] we want to ensure that our dog will come [02:41] back when called [02:43] too often distractions [02:46] are what makes this command one of the [02:49] hardest because we have competing [02:51] motivators we have squirrels rabbits [02:53] other dogs other people if your dog is [02:56] social so come when called i would say [02:59] is most definitely the most requested [03:02] and the most important command out of [03:05] all five and so what would be the [03:07] process for getting to the point of [03:09] teaching that reliable come when called [03:11] because just like you said there's all [03:12] kinds of different motivating factors [03:14] within the environment that are going to [03:16] impede on the progress of somebody [03:18] teaching their dog that reliable come [03:20] when called so how do you start it and [03:22] then how do you take it to where people [03:24] want it for that ability to call their [03:27] dog regardless of what's going on in the [03:29] environment yeah [03:31] so [03:32] one of the questions that i love to ask [03:35] owners i usually start this off in my [03:38] evaluations by asking this simple [03:40] question [03:42] why does a dog do anything for us [03:45] why do our dogs want to do these five [03:47] commands or why do our dogs want to do [03:49] anything [03:52] it's a very it's a very simple answer [03:55] but we sometimes forget because we do [03:58] sometimes put human characteristics on [04:00] dogs [04:02] but dogs do things because it betters [04:04] their situation they find their [04:06] advantage [04:08] in doing that because they maybe get [04:10] something they like [04:12] right so it comes down to [04:14] motivation we need to find out what [04:16] motivates our dog you know using food [04:19] using a toy finding something that your [04:22] dog loves some dogs have very high pack [04:24] drive [04:25] they love to be with you they love to be [04:27] pet other dogs don't really care for [04:30] that and that's okay [04:32] some dogs love playing with toys whether [04:34] it's tug or a little game of fetch [04:37] some dogs love food or maybe it's a [04:40] specific type of food or treat but [04:44] before we get into teaching any of these [04:47] five commands it's important to [04:49] understand that our dogs do things [04:52] because they get something out of it [04:54] sounds a little bit selfish and i know [04:56] we don't like to think that our dogs are [04:58] that way [05:00] but when it comes to something like a [05:02] recall we have to ensure that they get [05:05] something maybe [05:07] better than the squirrel better than the [05:10] dog and so this is something that i do [05:12] like to start teaching in the house [05:15] right and it simply starts with [05:18] loading a clicker many people are not [05:21] fans of a clicker [05:22] but a clicker is a very distinct sound [05:26] you push it it always makes that same [05:29] sound [05:31] and what i do is when i click it [05:34] i give the dog some food give it a treat [05:36] i may throw the piece of food so it gets [05:38] to run chase grab the tree and then i [05:40] may click it again and then the dog [05:42] comes back to me so i start with [05:44] charging the clicker or loading the [05:47] clicker with meaning when you hear this [05:49] sound [05:50] come to me and fun things will happen [05:53] either a fun game of play chase the food [05:56] or you get to grab a handful of food [05:58] from me [05:59] this is a very important part because [06:01] this clicker will help us in teaching [06:03] many behaviors in the future but it's [06:06] important when we first start to have a [06:09] marker because the clicker is just a [06:11] marker that is charged and charged with [06:14] dynamite i want to be able to click the [06:17] clicker and my dog to come from anywhere [06:20] in the house [06:21] because if my dog is upstairs and i'm [06:23] downstairs and i click and my dog comes [06:25] running down thinking oh my god we're [06:26] gonna get some food or i'm gonna get to [06:28] play this game [06:30] then then at that moment we have our [06:33] recall [06:34] we then need to take that and generalize [06:37] with all of these five commands it's [06:39] important that when we teach them we [06:41] start at home [06:42] in a little bit less of a distracted [06:44] environment [06:46] but we very quickly [06:48] need to start to generalize that [06:50] behavior because sit inside or come to [06:53] me inside does not mean the same thing [06:56] to them outside [06:58] because there's so much other things for [07:01] them to find out explore they can find [07:04] their advantage in pulling on the leash [07:06] because they get to go and smell [07:08] everything that they want to smell [07:11] or they find their advantage in ignoring [07:13] your common call command because they [07:16] get to [07:17] eat goose poop right that's not very [07:19] cool i don't want that that's very bad [07:22] and so we need to first start off with [07:25] charging a marker again i like a clicker [07:29] because as a human i also have emotions [07:33] and i'm not the best at controlling how [07:36] i sound sometimes i'm over enthusiastic [07:39] sometimes i'm tired especially if i [07:41] haven't had coffee [07:43] and so the clicker [07:45] no matter how i'm feeling [07:47] remains the same [07:48] because sometimes i may be like come [07:51] other times i may be like come [07:53] or good [07:54] good right [07:56] when i change my tone [07:58] the dog can definitely sense that and [08:00] that's a very important thing to [08:02] understand is we're not very consistent [08:05] with how we communicate with our dog [08:07] that's why these five commands are [08:09] important but to start it off [08:12] charging and loading that clicker [08:15] is key [08:16] because now we have [08:18] a way to create excitement it's the why [08:22] our dogs want to come to us because [08:25] fun things will happen when they hear [08:27] the clicker when they hear a yes marker [08:30] and we need to start off there [08:33] yeah it's funny and you hit on a couple [08:35] things that i was thinking about with [08:37] loading the marker something i tell [08:39] people if you want to use your voice [08:40] because i do use my voice most of the [08:42] time instead of using a clicker but it [08:45] is because i don't want to carry around [08:47] a clicker and i always tell people [08:48] there's two main reasons why clickers [08:51] tend to be very successful and very [08:53] useful tools within our training one as [08:56] you already mentioned beautifully it [08:58] always sounds the same it's incredibly [09:00] consistent because of course our dogs [09:02] don't have a dictionary they're not [09:04] looking up the words that we're using [09:06] they just hear a sound [09:08] so the click being very distinct and [09:10] consistent makes it a very useful tool [09:12] then the other thing is for me it's much [09:14] easier to separate two physicals than it [09:17] is to separate a physical and a verbal [09:20] meaning click reward is much easier [09:23] timing wise than yes [09:26] reward because of course we always want [09:29] to move at the exact same time we go yes [09:32] and then the dog is not becoming [09:34] conditioned to the marker something i [09:36] tell people is contrary to popular [09:38] belief our dogs don't do things just to [09:41] make us happy now granted we have some [09:43] of those dogs like some of those golden [09:45] retrievers or labradors that just want [09:48] to be around you 24 7 and that's their [09:50] number one thing but a lot of different [09:52] breeds don't necessarily always have [09:54] that characteristic so i like to use the [09:56] term we use in the military which is [09:58] with em [10:00] what's in it for me [10:02] now i do have one question on something [10:04] that you mentioned when the dog might be [10:06] upstairs and you click and the dog comes [10:08] running down what if the dog was doing a [10:10] behavior that you didn't like [10:13] when you clicked on the clicker so like [10:15] let's say he was chewing on [10:17] the carpet upstairs and you clicked now [10:19] he's coming running down but he's being [10:21] rewarded for chewing on the carpet [10:23] that's a very good question right and [10:27] the way i like to think of it especially [10:29] if we're talking about a young dog [10:34] if you can click and he comes off of the [10:37] shoe the carpet whatever he shoot the [10:40] curtain [10:42] we can now call him away from things [10:44] that may be a little bit higher value [10:46] than us [10:47] so it very much depends on how we look [10:50] at it so we may be marking that moment [10:52] in time [10:53] that he's chewing on the shoe [10:56] but we're also calling him off [10:59] of the shoe whereas [11:01] what i hear most of the time is i was [11:04] chasing my dog around with a shoe in his [11:06] mouth and he wouldn't let it go right [11:08] that that's the exact opposite of what [11:10] the clicker is doing the clickers say [11:12] okay i would rather drop this shoe and [11:14] come to you [11:16] and [11:17] and engage with you and so [11:20] it can and sometimes our timing we can [11:23] mark [11:25] a bad behavior but if they leave the [11:28] shoe in come to us [11:30] now we have re-successfully [11:33] redirected their attention [11:35] and can plan a strategy to help [11:38] with the behavior of chewing on shoes [11:41] but in uh [11:43] what i want you to think of is you're [11:45] also kind of teaching an out or a drop [11:48] it command because if they drop it which [11:50] again is not what's common typically we [11:53] have to chase the puppy around and then [11:55] they're jumping on the couch and around [11:57] the table and then we're hitting our [11:59] shin on something and yelling [12:02] we now have also a drop it command or an [12:05] out command so that clicker even though [12:08] the timing of it is marking the moment [12:10] that they're chewing is also teaching [12:12] them to let it go and also teaching them [12:15] to come back to us [12:17] and so if we notice that they do have a [12:19] tendency to chew on shoes or the carpet [12:23] then in our training program we have to [12:26] be aware of that and create a plan [12:29] that will help to provide them with [12:31] things that they can chew on [12:33] and then we can also work on teaching [12:35] them teaching them not to chew on [12:38] certain things yeah i always tell people [12:40] like the the marker pinpoints the moment [12:42] in time when the dog is right or wrong [12:44] so uh [12:46] if we have the dog loaded to the marker [12:48] and the dog is cause i tell people like [12:50] i've seen people with their dog outside [12:52] running around and then they look [12:54] outside they're like where's my dog and [12:55] he's behind a bush digging they don't [12:58] see it and they go oh well i'll use my [13:00] marker and they go free i use free as a [13:02] terminal marker and then the dog comes [13:04] running around and they're like oh [13:05] awesome it worked it got the dog to come [13:07] to me but they did it while the dog was [13:09] digging so now the dog is like oh [13:11] digging is fun [13:12] but [13:13] it also means i'm gonna get a treat if i [13:15] dig so like double whammy awesome i got [13:17] two things for this one behavior that [13:19] was a lot of fun and now they have to [13:21] work on fixing that so i always said [13:23] don't use the markers unless you can see [13:25] your dog doing the behavior so i was [13:27] thinking it might fit well with that i [13:29] mean do you agree with that or because i [13:31] feel like it could cause some issues if [13:34] you accidentally mark a behavior like [13:36] chewing or something yeah i mean it can [13:39] i would say it would more so affect that [13:41] if the dog has a foundation in shaping [13:44] which most dogs don't because in shaping [13:46] they're figuring out so if they have a [13:48] more free brain and then they make that [13:50] association i do believe that it [13:52] eventually can't but like i said if if [13:54] you can play it in a way to where you [13:57] set like the dog's digging and you're [13:59] you're essentially calling him off of [14:01] the digging right it's a call off of a [14:02] decoy which is very difficult to do it's [14:04] a call from something that they enjoy [14:06] and if you can call them off of that [14:09] then what we then you know then that [14:10] could be a really good uh reason to then [14:12] start to use something like the remote [14:14] collar right because then the remote [14:16] caller can can very clearly say okay the [14:18] digging is now not okay but when we talk [14:20] about positive if i can call you off of [14:22] something that you know is [14:24] self-rewarding is something that uh you [14:27] get enjoyment out of and you will [14:28] actually come to me because most of the [14:30] time they [14:31] if you click it they may not even come [14:32] to you right i mean that that's you know [14:34] that's ultimately they could be saying [14:36] come click you know yes and the dog most [14:39] likely probably won't because the [14:40] digging is more [14:42] rewarding than coming to the people uh [14:45] but if the dog has a good foundation and [14:47] free shaping then you could potentially [14:49] run the risk of teaching them to dig [14:52] more but that could then be a cause of [14:54] saying okay i don't like the digging i'm [14:55] gonna click you off of it and now let's [14:57] do this other stuff to exer uh expend [15:00] that energy that you have [15:03] and then we can [15:05] say okay i need to maybe work more [15:07] around places that you enjoy digging [15:10] sand maybe a particular spot at the park [15:13] and you take the dog there and you work [15:14] around that particular uh environment [15:17] but uh if your dog like i said if your [15:19] dog has a very strong and is more of a [15:21] free thinking dog [15:24] right uh i have a dog diaz [15:26] oh i did a ton of shaping with uh he [15:29] definitely will kick stuff up [15:31] if i start clicking it he's like oh [15:33] like i gotta go over here put my nose in [15:34] this thing or i gotta go over here and [15:36] put my paws on this or i gotta jump on [15:38] this he's a lot more than like cruz cruz [15:40] i trick [15:41] trained more like the the tom rose [15:43] school it's not his free thinking he's [15:46] more of like [15:47] i had to do a lot to kind of unlock his [15:49] brain and let him kind of think for [15:51] himself [15:53] right and so [15:54] uh with that cruz is going to [15:57] have less of an association of like he's [16:00] marking me for digging [16:02] whereas diaz may have a [16:04] a faster [16:06] response and like oh if i dig he clicks [16:08] me if i dig he clicks me but at that [16:10] moment then i would click him back to me [16:12] and i would redirect his attention with [16:15] sit down because uh it's it's a [16:17] self-rewarding behavior and it comes [16:19] from a place where there's just an [16:22] excessive amount of energy that they [16:24] need to release and so uh teaching some [16:27] some of these commands teaching commands [16:30] that will help to expand that energy in [16:31] a more productive way is [16:34] what i and how i kind of foresee it so [16:37] yes you may be marking that moment but [16:39] you have to think if i can click my dog [16:41] off of a decoy [16:43]  hey you know [16:44] you know [16:45] that is pretty damn good you know it's [16:47] not easy doing that and so no matter if [16:50] it's like come [16:52] if they if they come off of a decoy if [16:54] they sit out like on the on the entry to [16:56] a decoy that is impressive [16:58] because the biggest reward is that decoy [17:01] right and so if you could call like i i [17:04] view it in that sense right where like [17:06] some of these behaviors digging and all [17:07] this stuff is uh chewing and then we [17:10] have to it's a little bit [17:12] different because we have to then come [17:13] up with a plan if we know notice that [17:14] it's excessive if they're constantly [17:17] chewing on the shoe okay maybe but maybe [17:19] we then have shoes around and play games [17:21] click come get the food click come get [17:23] the food that's a really good point and [17:25] the free shaping is something that i [17:28] talk about a lot on my channel to help [17:30] create that proactive dog and a big [17:33] thing that you said which stood out is [17:35] of course making sure that when the dog [17:37] comes to you it's this really awesome [17:40] exciting thing to wear when the dog is [17:43] in a sense being told to come it's [17:45] exciting because it predicts something [17:47] that the dog really enjoys what are some [17:50] techniques that you've used as far as [17:53] maybe making the come when called a [17:55] little bit more valuable than some of [17:57] the other commands that don't have as [17:59] much safety involved with the command's [18:02] success i use a lot of unpredictable [18:06] rewards [18:08] varying the rewards is [18:10] what helps our dogs to never know if [18:13] they're gonna get a ball if they're [18:14] gonna get one piece of kibble or 20 [18:17] pieces of kibble or get to just get a [18:20] bunch of lovin from you by varying what [18:23] we give our dogs they never really know [18:26] what to expect [18:28] right and this is a little bit different [18:30] because [18:32] a lot of times and how i've trained in [18:35] the past is i have very specific markers [18:38] that will cue my dog [18:40] this is what you're getting [18:42] and so [18:43] i almost want my dog to not really know [18:46] what they're gonna get how much they're [18:48] gonna get i want it to be a surprise i [18:51] want it to be [18:52] unpredictable [18:54] right when we talk about dopamine it's [18:56] very important to understand that [18:59] when our dog receives [19:01] the reward [19:04] dopamine starts to [19:06] drop they've already [19:09] got it they're already satiated they've [19:12] just been satisfied too many times as [19:15] trainers or owners we think the reward [19:18] is where the highest they love what i [19:20] give them food [19:22] when in actuality it's the work [19:25] that produces that cue that says [19:28] this [19:29] is coming and by making it unpredictable [19:33] we create more excitement and more [19:36] dopamine than when it's predictable [19:39] and so there's a uh there's a very [19:42] awesome video [19:43] it's called jackpot dopamine by [19:46] professor sapolsky and it explains an [19:49] experiment that they did on monkeys [19:52] and pulling levers [19:54] the button they pull lever they receive [19:56] reward the [19:58] the the the light that cued [20:02] the monkeys to work [20:04] that is when their dopamine spiked the [20:06] most because they're like yeah if i do [20:08] this [20:09] i get [20:10] oh i got nothing i got to do it harder i [20:12] got to work a little bit harder to [20:14] potentially get more and so by making it [20:17] very variable [20:19] by changing up the reward and making it [20:22] unpredictable we can create so much more [20:25] excitement if i always click the dog and [20:28] give them one piece of food click the [20:30] dog and give them one piece of food [20:31] click the dog and give them one piece of [20:33] food we do a little bit the opposite [20:36] they they already know click means all [20:38] right i get one piece of food [20:40] but if we surprise them and give them [20:43] 30 pieces of food [20:46] that in itself is like whoa okay what [20:49] did i do to get this one maybe they came [20:51] back a little faster maybe they called [20:53] off of a squirrel [20:55] those type of things i would start to [20:57] maybe pay them a little bit more right [21:00] in a capitalistic society we are [21:02] rewarded uh hopefully [21:06] by our efforts if we work harder [21:09] we [21:10] in turn hopefully receive more if we put [21:13] more work in it's not a communistic [21:16] society whereas like no matter how hard [21:18] you work you get the same as that person [21:21] that doesn't create [21:23] very excited workers [21:26] and it doesn't create very excited dogs [21:28] now there is a time and place where i do [21:30] believe we need to [21:32] make things a little bit [21:34] less exciting right because when we talk [21:36] about motivation or excitement in young [21:38] dogs [21:40] guess what that does it ruins [21:43] our stability [21:45] excitement is the awesome the exact [21:47] opposite of [21:49] now be calm [21:50] so it's a double-edged sword and it's a [21:53] balance and so when we're working with [21:55] our dogs we need to find that balance i [21:57] want my dog to enjoy training but i also [22:00] need to teach him you also have to stay [22:02] there and so when we talk about [22:04] different reward systems for things [22:07] where i'm trying to create stability i [22:09] don't want to use a lot of unpredictable [22:11] rewards but to create excitement i do so [22:15] for something like the come when call [22:17] command i definitely use more of an [22:20] unpredictable reward system because [22:23] i want my dog to be like maybe he'll [22:25] whip out a ball this time i don't know i [22:27] better go check and in doing so it's not [22:30] only calling my dog to grab them to put [22:32] the leash on because that is what's most [22:34] common most of the time when we're [22:36] calling our dogs is because they're [22:38] doing something bad [22:40] they're doing something we don't like [22:43] and so we call them to say hey get over [22:44] here i'm gonna put the leash back on you [22:46] now [22:48] and you better believe our dogs we'll [22:50] figure that out fairly quickly [22:52] so [22:53] we don't just want them to come to say [22:56] okay now i'm taking away your freedom [22:58] right we're punishing them and they are [23:00] very smart so they will come and then [23:02] avoid you again and then go do what [23:04] they're doing anyways but by [23:07] using an unpredictable reward system for [23:09] something like the come when called [23:10] command [23:12] we have [23:14] a better way to [23:16] uh create more motivation in wanting to [23:19] come back to us again it's the why why [23:21] does our want to come back with stuff [23:24] like our sit with stuff like our down [23:27] as much as i want my dog to be excited [23:29] doing it i don't need them to be like [23:31] sitting and like shaking like oh my god [23:33] we're gonna have so much no i want to [23:35] create more stability in my sit in my [23:38] down in my place command and maybe even [23:41] in my heel command [23:43] for competition obedience i do want more [23:45] motivation so i will at times use more [23:48] of an unpredictable reward system but [23:50] for sit down place [23:53] i don't need them to be so excited [23:55] because again when we have too much [23:57] motivation we don't have stability and [23:59] that can be a problem if we want to work [24:01] on the down stay for five minutes a [24:03] place stay with company [24:05] we want to change how we're rewarding [24:08] our dogs to match what we're looking for [24:11] i don't when my dog gets on a place i'm [24:12] like whoa you're doing great because [24:14] what's most likely gonna happen in the [24:16] beginning they're gonna jump off [24:19] too much excitement too much motivation [24:21] is gonna ruin stability which is [24:23] stability is kind of like our stay [24:26] yeah and that's great and i love that [24:28] you talk about mixing in different types [24:31] of rewards it's actually not something [24:33] that i've thought of using before for [24:35] the come when call but i can definitely [24:37] see how that will add more motivation to [24:40] the exercise i think it's something i'm [24:42] going to start incorporating because of [24:44] course anytime we're trying to get [24:45] reliability from something it's a matter [24:47] of are we able to control the motivating [24:49] factors that in a sense dictate what our [24:52] dogs are going to do [24:53] traditionally or usually what i would do [24:55] is i would have my kibble that i'm using [24:58] just for all the other basic obedience [25:00] commands and then i would use [25:01] freeze-dried dog food for the come when [25:03] called because that's more valuable but [25:06] i'm definitely going to incorporate [25:07] adding a few different things into it [25:09] because i can see how that can add more [25:12] excitement to the command which of [25:14] course is so important now you mentioned [25:16] some of the other ones those are [25:18] important for these five commands that [25:20] everybody should be teaching their dogs [25:23] can we go into some of those other ones [25:24] a little bit or did you have anything [25:25] else you wanted to add with the come one [25:27] called yeah no i think um [25:31] the example that i think we [25:33] as dog trainers know and and we we speak [25:36] of is kind of like [25:38] the gambler [25:39] right when we talk about a gambler he's [25:42] got a little bit of an addiction problem [25:44] right he goes to the casino and he plays [25:47] the slot machines but he never knows how [25:51] much he's going to win [25:54] but it's the same action that causes [25:56] that same excitement and maybe he wins [25:58] nothing and then he's like it's the same [26:00] action with the unpredictable reward [26:03] sometimes he gets nothing other times he [26:05] hits the jackpot and that's what creates [26:09] that [26:09] addiction and i do want my dog to be [26:11] addicted to a command like i want my dog [26:13] to come whenever i call him it's a very [26:15] important command dogs running in the [26:17] street dogs running after another dog [26:19] dogs running after people it is never a [26:21] fun thing to have to chase your dog [26:24] and so creating a very a dog that is [26:27] very addicted to coming when called is [26:29] not a bad thing i want my doctor to be [26:31] like heck yeah i want to come you know [26:33] and so [26:35] but that example of the gambler it's the [26:37] same chi-ching [26:40] it's not a different one [26:43] cueing the gambler to what he's going to [26:45] win [26:46] it's the same sound [26:48] and yet he keeps coming back because he [26:50] never knows how much he's going to get [26:53] but [26:54] going into some of the other commands [26:56] you know we have to understand that any [26:57] of the commands that we use with our [26:59] dogs [27:01] that is the language that we are [27:03] teaching them [27:05] whether you say sit or you use a [27:07] different language like [27:09] asi or [27:10] sits [27:12] german [27:13] we are building an understanding and a [27:16] response we're conditioning our dogs to [27:18] do a particular behavior [27:21] with these commands and it's very [27:23] important one of the most common things [27:24] i see people do with their dogs [27:27] say sit they didn't sit hey put your [27:29] butt down hey come on all the elbows [27:31] down [27:33] that right there is being inconsistent [27:36] with what we're looking for them to do [27:38] sit means put your butt down on the [27:39] ground so if i say sit and they didn't [27:41] do it i'm going to say sit again i'm not [27:43] going to then change up the language and [27:45] try german or spanish if i've never [27:47] taught them that so [27:50] the commands [27:51] that we use with our dogs our primary [27:54] way of communication with my dog [27:57] if i want my dog to chillax and not be [28:00] so crazy because as you know you got a [28:02] malinois shirt on malinois don't really [28:05] have a chill button they're not really [28:07] chill dogs [28:08] so [28:10] i use the down command instead of saying [28:12] hey stop moving around what are you [28:14] doing just [28:15] i just say [28:17] down down is a very important command [28:19] especially when we talk about duration [28:21] so i use down and i teach down as a [28:23] command to say we're just gonna hang out [28:26] here for a bit whether it be at a coffee [28:28] shop whether it be in my living room [28:31] down is one of those ones that i love [28:34] because it helps to create [28:36] a little bit of that off switch down is [28:39] the position that they rest in down is [28:41] the position that they sleep in right [28:45] where the body goes the mind hopefully [28:48] follows not always with these melon [28:49] walls right but [28:51] another command is sit sit i think is a [28:55] very important one [28:56] but it's i use this for brief moments [29:01] in time i don't [29:03] i don't really practice a 10 minute sit [29:06] stay [29:07] i would just use it down but if i need [29:09] my dog to sit there while i say hey yo [29:11] how's it going nice to meet you i will [29:13] have them go into a sit and then go on [29:15] my merry way or if i'm coming to a [29:17] crosswalk i don't want my dog to down [29:19] and get comfortable and be like all [29:20] right come on [29:21] we got 10 seconds now get up and let's [29:23] cross the street [29:24] and so at specific moments i do like to [29:27] use the sick command to create some [29:29] stability just we're just going to stay [29:31] here for a second [29:33] and then we [29:34] carry on whether it's to greet somebody [29:36] whether it's at a stop sign [29:38] or or crosswalk [29:40] so sit is another valuable one [29:44] i do also think [29:46] heal [29:47] we need to teach our dogs to heal and [29:49] walk with us not walk us or us walk them [29:53] dragging them behind us right so this is [29:56] a very important command and i usually [29:58] go in [30:00] teaching the heel command with the [30:01] mindset of [30:02] it's a game of follow me [30:06] i don't like to say hey just heal he'll [30:07] stay on this side i don't hold my dog i [30:09] don't restrain my dog i don't tighten up [30:11] the leash to where they can't leave my [30:13] side [30:15] i let them make a choice [30:17] but i also make it engaging i teach it [30:20] as a game of follow me because when we [30:22] go into places where it's a little [30:25] crowded i love taking my dogs out to [30:27] outdoor malls or uh place hikes and [30:30] stuff like that but in crowded places i [30:33] need to make sure that my dog's not at [30:34] the end of a six foot leash taking out [30:36] people that are walking by us right so i [30:39] want my dog to be nice and close to me [30:41] and kind of follow me [30:42] right one of the things that i see with [30:44] this heel command is we don't spend a [30:47] lot of time focusing on teaching them to [30:49] want to be with us and instead we're on [30:51] our phone looking and walking as our dog [30:54] is walking pulling and we're just like [30:56] here you go do your thing and then two [30:58] years later we have a little bit of a [30:59] problem [31:00] so with the heel make it a game i love [31:04] to make it a game of follow me [31:07] we have to think that our dogs are [31:08] constantly learning if they're pulling [31:11] and they find something [31:13] disgusting to eat [31:15] they will eat it [31:16] and they will learn something that by [31:18] pulling it gets them to all the [31:20] disgusting things [31:22] so heel is another really important [31:25] command that i like to have in my toe [31:27] bag [31:28] place [31:29] is a fantastic one place teaching our [31:31] dogs to go to a specific area and just [31:34] hang out there it's very similar to a [31:36] down [31:38] right but maybe it's a little bit more [31:40] comfortable because you know i do teach [31:42] my dogs to place on dog beds so i just [31:44] say go chill on your bed i'll leave the [31:47] room come back and my dog's on her back [31:49] with her feet up in the air she's very [31:51] comfortable but it's also teaching her [31:53] you do have to [31:55] stay on there whether guests come over [31:58] whether we're eating dinner [32:00] or in [32:01] particular situations where i just need [32:04] her to go away [32:05] for a second while i bring in groceries [32:07] if i'm bringing the groceries i can't [32:09] get out of my way move what are you [32:10] doing i just say place and my dog [32:13] go to her place [32:15] hang out [32:16] and it creates so much more clarity as [32:19] far as what i'm looking for from her or [32:22] him [32:23] and he's like yeah sure okay yeah i'll [32:25] go over here and as soon as i'm done [32:26] with the groceries you can get off and [32:27] then we can do what we're gonna do i [32:30] love the place command now i call it the [32:32] climb command i thought you called it [32:34] the climb command as well oh yeah man i [32:37] i've uh [32:38] i've changed my ways i'm a placer now [32:42] because i was like what what's a good [32:43] command for the bowl where we have the [32:45] dog put their front paws on the bowl and [32:47] then we can teach them to pivot their [32:48] back and i was like you know what i'll [32:50] call that place i'll stick with climb [32:52] but regardless it doesn't matter what we [32:53] call it as you said earlier as long as [32:55] we're consistent with the command and [32:58] climb as you said or place there's all [32:59] kinds of different applications for that [33:01] where it could be valuable and i was [33:03] thinking as you were talking about heel [33:05] or loose leash walking [33:07] some people may think that they don't [33:09] really need that command because they [33:10] don't take their dog on walks they just [33:12] keep the dog inside the house and in the [33:14] backyard and the dog's really not [33:16] getting much of that exposure out in the [33:18] environment and you know that's fine if [33:20] some people have those house dogs but [33:22] where does everybody need to take their [33:23] dogs to the veterinarian clinic at some [33:26] point so even if the dog doesn't go out [33:29] on daily walks teaching that especially [33:32] in the beginning so you have it ready to [33:34] use whenever you need to go somewhere or [33:37] they have to take the dog to [33:39] a boarding place because they're going [33:41] to be going on vacation or something [33:42] like that it can definitely come into [33:44] play regardless of who you are and the [33:47] place command or climb command yeah i [33:50] love using that for all kinds of [33:51] different things getting the dog geared [33:53] up to go on a walk having them go to [33:55] their place while you're eating dinner [33:57] you know whatever it is that you're [33:59] doing and that's something that i want [34:01] to talk about as well that i think is [34:03] very important [34:04] is telling our dogs what we want them to [34:07] do in any given situation and you [34:10] basically we're hitting on that i don't [34:11] want to be having to walk by and tell my [34:13] dogs get out of my way while i'm [34:14] carrying groceries i just say go to the [34:16] place so now in that situation you're [34:19] teaching your dog hey when i'm coming in [34:21] carrying groceries go sit over there and [34:24] just chill out for a little bit how can [34:26] doing these things teaching our dogs [34:28] what to do in certain situations that [34:31] the dog is going to be presented in have [34:34] an effect on their overall well-being [34:37] like making them more confident making [34:39] them more comfortable in their [34:40] environment can you hit on that a little [34:42] bit as well because i want people to [34:43] understand the importance not just being [34:45] able to control our dogs but rather [34:48] putting our dogs in a good mental state [34:50] and well-being yeah no for sure man um [34:54] these commands [34:57] ultimately [34:58] help our dogs to understand where they [35:01] fit in our pack [35:04] because typically if we don't have [35:07] these commands or ways of communicating [35:09] with them [35:11] one of the more common things i see [35:14] is anxiety the dogs don't know what to [35:18] do with themselves and they find things [35:21] to do that are self-rewarding or [35:23] self-soothing [35:25] barking [35:26] digging [35:28] chewing because they have this i need to [35:31] do something and if we don't help to [35:34] direct that energy [35:36] to [35:37] something productive or something [35:39] positive [35:41] the more more commonly what you see is a [35:44] dog that has anxiety [35:47] so it helps our dogs to not have to [35:49] think so much about i don't know what to [35:51] do with myself i'm a little bit antsy [35:54] right we can give our dog something and [35:57] with doing that [35:58] it's it's it's very similar to classical [36:02] conditioning just for example that [36:04] example of coming in with the groceries [36:06] after being very consistent when every [36:09] time i come in with groceries and tell [36:11] my dog to place come in with the [36:13] groceries tell my dog to play come in [36:15] with the groceries my dog is going to be [36:18] like hey you don't have to tell me i'm [36:19] going to go to the place [36:21] that is the goal and so by being clear [36:25] with the commands that we're teaching [36:27] by having them do what we would like [36:29] them to do [36:30] right because it's not a problem until [36:31] it's a problem you know [36:33] and then so we need to kind of find [36:36] alternative solutions and these commands [36:39] typically are going to be [36:41] better [36:43] solutions than having them do what [36:45] they're already doing going in between [36:46] your legs with groceries jumping out the [36:49] door you know this is a very important [36:51] one when somebody knocks i'm always [36:52] telling my dog [36:53] place or climb [36:56] but i give them that command so then [36:58] they hear the door and they're like oh [37:00] i'm gonna go place myself and that helps [37:03] to have harmony in my house i'm not [37:06] fighting my dog to get to the door [37:07] classical conditioning does take some [37:09] time to kick in but that's ultimately [37:12] what we're doing pavlov already did all [37:14] the research for us we just have to be [37:16] consistent [37:18] in what we would like our dogs to do [37:21] when we're inconsistent we create [37:25] an environment where it's not clear [37:27] what's expected of them [37:29] and anxiety can happen [37:31] it can be a confidence issue there's a [37:33] lot of things [37:34] that can happen and but when our dogs [37:37] understand [37:38] their place in the pack and what they [37:40] need to do you have harmony so much [37:43] faster you said exactly what i wanted [37:46] you to say because it is important you [37:49] know uh we think about often people are [37:52] told when they're working with their [37:53] dogs that they need to be the confident [37:55] leader well here's the problem you can't [37:58] be confident if you don't know what to [38:00] do [38:01] you know you could tell someone all day [38:02] be confident be confident but if they [38:04] don't know what to do in different [38:05] situations that anxiety or fear or [38:09] whatever you want to call it is going to [38:11] come to the surface and it's the same [38:13] thing with our dogs if our dog knows [38:15] when our owner's in the kitchen i go [38:17] here boom their confidence goes up if [38:19] they know what to do when they're [38:21] out on a walk their confidence goes up [38:23] and as a side effect which you hit on [38:25] beautifully is it drops that anxiety [38:27] level i mean again we just have to even [38:29] look at it from our own perspective as [38:31] humans anytime i'm going into a [38:32] situation and i don't know what to do [38:35] i'm more nervous i'm more anxious about [38:37] that situation i may try to act cool [38:40] calm and collective but inside i'm going [38:43] through a bunch of stress which our dogs [38:45] can experience the same way so going [38:47] through teaching these five commands sit [38:49] down come heel and uh what was the other [38:52] one sit down come heel and place was the [38:56] other one now something that we did not [38:59] say out of the five which some people [39:01] are going to be asking about is well [39:02] isn't the stay [39:04] wouldn't that be in the top five explain [39:07] why it's not in the top five because [39:10] really it actually is yes of course [39:12] there are many times where i need my dog [39:14] to stay right where he's at right i [39:17] don't in particular use the word stay [39:22] but i do [39:24] teach an implied stay so again with some [39:27] of these commands sit [39:30] down [39:31] place i would like [39:33] for them to do it and keep doing it [39:36] until [39:38] we release them [39:40] right that clicker that i said that i [39:42] like to teach my dogs a recall from [39:45] is also my release [39:48] i could also say a word like free i can [39:51] also say a word like break [39:54] those can also be it's kind of a tomato [39:57] tomato right [40:01] by teaching an implied stay [40:05] we eliminate the use of the word stay so [40:08] when i tell my dog to sit i would like [40:11] him to sit there and i will keep [40:13] rewarding him while he's in the sit sit [40:16] i take a step back and i'll go back and [40:18] feed him sit i'll take two steps back [40:20] and i go and feed him and then when i [40:22] release him whether it's with free [40:24] whether it's with a click he can then [40:26] get up and i can give him more food i [40:28] can give him pets depending on what [40:30] we're working and where we're at in our [40:32] training program [40:35] we can [40:36] reward with various items and so [40:39] the stay is very important but i do [40:42] teach an implied stay so when i say sit [40:45] it is also included that they must stay [40:47] there until i release you so i say free [40:50] then you can get up and get this piece [40:52] of food when i say down i would like you [40:55] to stay in that down until i tell you [40:57] free or until i release you the word is [41:00] not the most important [41:02] but the act of them staying there and so [41:06] i like to think of it as this and this [41:08] is a really good way that i heard or [41:10] heard of it or you know heard it put how [41:13] about that so [41:16] to teach the state i like to think of it [41:18] as room service [41:21] when the dog is in a position that i [41:23] want to teach to stay i'm going to be [41:25] bringing them food because i'm room [41:27] servicing them right if we go to a hotel [41:32] and they have room service we may never [41:34] want to leave our room we're like oh i'm [41:36] just going to order all the food to us [41:37] i'm going to be in this big old bed [41:38] watching movies all day i would love [41:41] for that i probably need one of those [41:43] type of things soon here but [41:46] room service can help to make them want [41:49] to stay there so the way that i would [41:51] teach an implied sit is by sitting and [41:53] taking them a piece of food stepping [41:55] back taking them a piece of food i will [41:57] bring the food to you so that you want [41:59] to stay there [42:01] and we create value in staying there [42:03] when i release i can give a food [42:05] sometimes i can pet sometimes if i'm [42:07] trying to create stability i don't want [42:09] the release to have too much excitement [42:11] because then they're like come on tell [42:12] me to get up tell me to get up so we can [42:14] play this big game [42:16] so it's a balance [42:18] where you're at in your training program [42:20] if you have a young puppy if you just [42:22] adopted a dog it will change but the [42:24] same principles remain sit we're [42:27] implying to stay down is implied to stay [42:30] there place is implied to stay there [42:33] heal is implied to stay there because we [42:35] don't want our dogs to learn they put [42:37] their butt down they can you know they [42:39] get a piece of food and they get back up [42:40] and we have to then wrangle them up and [42:42] try it again [42:43] so it's very important to [42:45] also another important thing to teach [42:47] you about is [42:49] a release marker [42:51] free [42:51] a clicker [42:53] break [42:54] something that [42:55] tells our dog [42:57] you can get up now yeah good job you did [42:59] good you know you're released good boy [43:01] uh it's very important to have that in [43:03] place as well absolutely yeah i always [43:05] tell people if you're going to release a [43:06] dog three main ways of doing it giving [43:08] them a new command using the terminal [43:10] marker or using a release word and those [43:13] will get the dog released from that [43:14] position so when we're looking at it [43:16] those five most important commands was a [43:18] sit down come heel place and being able [43:21] to do a stay in each one of those i have [43:24] two final questions for this interview [43:25] the second one is what would be some [43:27] honorable mentions because bare minimum [43:30] somebody can navigate throughout an [43:31] entire dog's life using those five [43:33] commands including the stay within each [43:35] one of those commands where it applies [43:37] what would be some honorable mentions [43:39] that could add additional value control [43:41] and clarity to people who want to do a [43:44] little bit more than the five necessary [43:46] ones for sure for sure so some honorable [43:49] mentions [43:50] we have to think of a drop it [43:53] or an out command that is by far one of [43:56] the things that we leave out and in turn [44:00] we can create problems when it comes to [44:02] toys when it comes to shoes when it [44:03] comes to things that our dogs want to [44:05] put in their mouth sometimes we need to [44:08] take it out of their mouth so teaching [44:10] them a drop it or an out command and [44:12] again i like to start this with food i [44:15] like to say i'll trade you for this you [44:17] have a ball in your mouth i have this [44:19] other ball in my mouth we can switch we [44:21] can trade you drop that one i'll mark it [44:24] and throw the other one and so teaching [44:26] and out especially for a higher drive [44:28] dog some dogs may not have uh well i was [44:31] going to use my pug [44:33] as an example but he has a very high [44:34] prey drive [44:36] it's pretty funny but um [44:38] some dogs may not have an intense prey [44:41] drive and so we may not have to worry [44:44] too much about it but if we have a dog [44:46] that loves to play fetch it's important [44:47] that we teach in out command [44:50] it's important that we also potentially [44:52] teach a quiet command [44:55] some of our dogs [44:56] maybe [44:58] my genetics are going to be a little bit [45:00] more vocal than other dogs so teaching [45:02] them something like a quiet command [45:06] teaching them to be quiet on cue can be [45:08] very helpful in situations where you're [45:10] in an apartment and [45:12] your dog's barking and your neighbors [45:14] are complaining that's never fun it adds [45:15] a bunch of stress and unnecessary [45:18] stress that can [45:20] cause other problems in the long run [45:23] so teaching a quiet command [45:25] and a lot of times it sounds super [45:28] counterintuitive but if you can teach [45:30] your dog to bark on command [45:32] we can teach them to be quiet on command [45:35] right we're teaching a behavior [45:37] and the opposite behavior so i think [45:39] that's a very important thing to kind of [45:40] keep in mind yes with the leave it [45:42] that's incredibly important leave it or [45:44] drop it and that really comes down to [45:46] safety because of course if somebody's [45:47] out on a walk their dog goes to pick up [45:49] something that could be potentially [45:50] harmful telling them to drop it or leave [45:53] it could potentially save the dog's life [45:55] or at least prevent them from getting [45:57] really sick and then i agree too the [45:59] quiet command is very important because [46:02] if we're inside as you said an apartment [46:04] we have a condo we want to be courteous [46:06] to those that are there living in the [46:08] environment with us just being [46:10] part of the community so these are going [46:13] to be some things that people should be [46:14] teaching their dogs now the last [46:16] question that i have is of course we can [46:19] get our dogs to do these behaviors by [46:21] using incentives whether it's affection [46:24] toys rewards how are we gonna get to a [46:27] point where it's reliable regardless of [46:29] what's going on in the environment the [46:31] one i want to direct list specifically [46:33] to is the come when called because as [46:36] you said that's something that's [46:38] incredibly important it's for the safety [46:40] and well-being of the dog if the dog [46:42] sees a squirrel across the street takes [46:44] off after that squirrel the leash flies [46:46] out of the owner's hands how are we [46:48] gonna guarantee to get that dog to turn [46:51] around and come back if it's number one [46:52] favorite thing in the world is the [46:54] squirrel what can we do [46:56] to ensure the reliability for sure for [46:59] sure um so we what we have to think of [47:02] is all of these commands [47:05] are helping to enrich our dogs lives the [47:08] more we do with them and these are just [47:10] some commands i start off with i love [47:13] also teaching my dogs tricks i love also [47:15] teaching my dogs behaviors that have [47:17] nothing to do with maybe the competition [47:20] i'm looking to compete in because it [47:22] just provides enrichment more outlets [47:24] for their energy we have to understand [47:26] that a lot of behavioral issues come [47:30] come because [47:31] of lack [47:35] a lot of the behavioral issues [47:38] come because our dogs have an excessive [47:40] amount of energy that they need to [47:42] release they find behaviors like we just [47:45] mentioned barking as a way to release [47:48] some of that pent-up energy and barking [47:52] is self-rewarding it helps them to feel [47:55] better because all of that energy now [47:57] they're expending but it comes at a cost [48:00] getting evicted causing high stress [48:03] around the house [48:04] chewing chewing on floor bars chewing up [48:07] doors all of that stuff comes because [48:09] our dogs have an excessive amount of [48:11] energy so these commands help to build a [48:14] strong foundation to then build off of [48:17] because the more you do with your dog [48:19] the better life [48:20] you guys will have together the better [48:22] life your dog will also have so i like [48:24] to think of doing these commands but i [48:26] also like to get them exercise whether [48:28] it's playing a game with fetch or [48:30] teaching them something like a treadmill [48:32] those type of things where we can help [48:33] to expend a little bit of that energy so [48:35] that we can create even more harmony and [48:37] provide our dogs with what they need [48:40] so to then answer your question [48:44] it very much so depends on the training [48:47] program that we are going with [48:50] ultimately [48:52] just like i said i do like to start all [48:54] of this with food [48:56] but at some point our dogs are going to [48:59] be full they're going to say you know [49:01] what i can't take anymore [49:04] that's a very good reason for them to [49:05] want to ignore me when i click them [49:07] ignore me when i call them because [49:09] they've already had their feel for the [49:10] day but like dude i'll get food tomorrow [49:12] it's all good [49:14] so [49:15] to help [49:16] build [49:18] on top of that positive i like to add in [49:21] some forms of negative reinforcement and [49:25] the way that i like to start is with a [49:26] leash but then ultimately to get in my [49:29] opinion the most reliability something [49:32] like a remote training caller an [49:34] e-collar a remote collar those type that [49:37] tool in particular [49:39] will allow me to give my dogs the most [49:43] freedom [49:45] and have a way of communicating to them [49:49] most callers go about a half mile so [49:51] from a half mile [49:54] to come to me so these remote callers [49:56] can help when talk correctly it's a very [49:59] that's a whole other [50:01] youtube nathan shelmer video [50:03] when talk correctly [50:05] to respond to it [50:07] we can give our dogs more freedom [50:09] because now i can say come and i can [50:11] give a little tap on the neck and it [50:13] means okay i'm coming back to you [50:15] whether it means excitement's coming [50:17] because we've taught it [50:19] taught it to me to come back to you that [50:21] remote collar will help to build and [50:24] utilize more quadrants in the quadrants [50:28] of learning and the theory of learning [50:30] that will just help to ensure our dogs [50:33] to come back to us so teaching some form [50:35] of negative reinforcement and the [50:37] e-collar the remote collar is one that [50:39] we can [50:40] use [50:41] from distances [50:43] so it allows me to remove the leash [50:47] and feel safe because at a certain point [50:50] there are a thousand pictures that i can [50:53] show my dog i can show my dog [50:55] skateboarders i can show my dogs people [50:56] on bikes i can show my dogs other dogs [50:59] excited dogs fearful dogs but you know [51:01] there are just some things that i [51:03] haven't encountered there are still ten [51:05] thousand other pictures [51:07] that i haven't trained them [51:09] on how to respond so that remote color [51:13] is going to be a little bit easier to [51:15] generalize all of these commands in this [51:18] little tiny feeling when we can teach it [51:20] correctly [51:21] because in the event i run across a [51:23] moose [51:24] a snake something that my dogs have [51:26] never seen before [51:28] i can then fall back on a tool like the [51:31] remote collar if they don't respond [51:33] because they're [51:34] not hungry so to get the most [51:36] reliability in my opinion using [51:38] something like a remote collar is key [51:40] but [51:42] introducing and knowing how to utilize [51:44] that remote collar is very important [51:46] also i could not agree more with that [51:50] come when called very important command [51:52] but if it's not reliable then it's [51:54] completely worthless and the remote [51:56] training collar in my opinion obviously [51:58] as well as yours is going to help get [52:00] that reliability regardless of what [52:02] circumstances or situation the dog may [52:04] be placed in and in the end really if [52:07] you think about it it's for safety it's [52:08] for the well-being of our dogs it's to [52:10] give them freedom something we talked [52:12] about before when i'm getting ready to [52:14] go to a private lesson and i'm taking my [52:17] remote collar with for the lesson i have [52:19] to hide it from my dogs because if they [52:21] see it they get really excited because [52:24] they think i'm getting ready to take [52:26] them out on a hike or i'm taking them to [52:27] the beach or i'm taking them to the [52:29] local park to play fetch it means [52:31] something fun but it also gives us that [52:34] safety that control and that reliability [52:36] that everybody wants [52:38] uh so one of the things that i want to [52:40] do is put all your contact information [52:42] in the

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 378/841,3 seconds between cause and [03:44] effect which is such a minute period of [03:47] time [03:48] but the ability to reach out and poke [03:50] the dog [03:51] in a second and get that dog's attention [03:54] is so important it can save your dog's [03:56] life [03:58] so when it comes to introducing the [04:00] collar properly [04:02] we have to take a slow and steady [04:05] approach and give proper communication [04:07] if we go too fast we'll end up making [04:09] mistakes slow and steady wins the race [04:12] the dog's not going to be awfully [04:14] reliable in a session or two but [04:17] with three weeks or a month of proper [04:20] conditioning [04:22] we can definitely have the dog off leash [04:25] and reliably that whenever we call the [04:27] dog because it's for safety we call them [04:29] they come back to us [04:31] and then at a more advanced level we can [04:33] actually stop the dog and have the dog [04:35] sit at a distance right we're calling [04:37] the dog to us and let's say god forbid [04:39] um a car's coming we can tell the dog to [04:42] sit and we can reach out and actually [04:44] poke the dog on the shoulder [04:46] dogs don't have the ability to multitask [04:48] a dog can only think about one thing at [04:50] one time and then dogs also have [04:52] auditory and visual exclusion [04:54] dog owners all the time tell me oh my my [04:56] dog's ignoring me and i say well are [04:58] they ignoring you or are they staring at [05:00] something very intently and they're not [05:02] they're not hearing you because they [05:04] shut off their ears [05:06] to heighten their their eyes [05:08] right but it's the same thing as calling [05:11] someone's name they're preoccupied [05:13] they're distracted but then you call [05:14] their name and you poke them on the [05:16] shoulder and then you go oh [05:17] and then they hear you [05:19] it's a physical touch paired with an [05:21] audible tone of our command and it [05:24] creates that consistency right away of [05:26] not only can they hear us but they can [05:27] feel us at the same time [05:29] i like that you said that it's like [05:31] tapping them on the shoulder and it made [05:33] me think of something else as well an [05:35] experience that i had i had my dogs at [05:37] the park we're playing having a good [05:39] time and some guy walks up to me crosses [05:42] his arm looks at my dog and says [05:44] is that a shock collar i train dogs the [05:47] real way and i said oh you train dogs [05:49] the real way and i said so you're [05:51] telling me the remote collar taught my [05:53] dog this sit down stand spin heel center [05:56] and he was like oh you're a trainer huh [05:59] i'm like yeah a remote training collar [06:01] is not this terrible device as you said [06:03] beautifully it's [06:04] a tool to communicate very clearly but [06:07] most importantly it's also safety [06:10] a hundred percent and it can it can save [06:13] the dog's life [06:15] so you know people are apprehensive to [06:17] want to use the remote training color [06:18] which i totally understand it can be a [06:21] really scary because it's so easy to [06:24] communicate that it's just as easy to [06:26] communicate the wrong thing and when i [06:28] first started i was terrified of them [06:31] it's perfectly natural to be terrified [06:33] of something that you could potentially [06:34] make a mistake on right it's like when i [06:37] first started riding motorcycles at an [06:39] older age you know i've only been riding [06:40] for four years i'm 39 i started at 35 [06:44] like i was apprehensive that this you [06:46] know i've done so many dangerous things [06:48] in my life i get bit by dogs for a [06:49] living i'm not gonna let this thing be [06:52] the thing that's gonna kill me right so [06:54] i took it slow and i learned over time [06:57] and i and i i graduated into feeling [07:00] confident over time as opposed to [07:03] expecting too much too quickly [07:06] and and that just goes for all dog [07:08] owners everyone expects their dog to [07:09] pick things up right away [07:11] and it just doesn't work that way [07:13] because dogs learn through timing [07:15] consistency and reinforcement [07:17] like [07:18] we have to do anywhere between [07:20] 50 to 150 repetitions just for the dog [07:23] to start to understand the behavior [07:25] right when i tell owners like okay how [07:27] many you know you have to do [07:29] sits for the dog to understand sit well [07:32] that sounds a little like a lot it's [07:34] actually not because if you break it up [07:36] over each day five minutes here five [07:38] minutes there you do 10 sits per session [07:42] in 15 days you know you're like you're [07:44] getting your stuff in and you can [07:45] condition that and it's the same thing [07:47] for the e-collar we have to go slow [07:50] because we want the dog to have proper [07:52] responses when they feel the stimulation [07:56] and the key thing is that when we put [07:58] the collar on the dog the dog should [08:00] never make a sound [08:02] meaning that when the average person [08:04] goes to [08:06] uh petsmart and buys an e-collar [08:08] with no trainer involved they usually [08:12] press the button until the dog feels it [08:14] and then that means that it's way too [08:16] high [08:17] we don't as humans [08:19] without proper training have the ability [08:22] to read the dog's body language of when [08:24] they're feeling it because it's [08:25] literally as little as [08:30] just a minute the dog goes what was that [08:33] it's almost like um [08:34] a fly landing on the dog [08:36] right it would almost like you might [08:37] like try to swat it away it doesn't [08:39] painful it didn't bite you right you're [08:41] just it's a little annoying [08:43] but once we teach the dog how to turn [08:45] that annoying thing off [08:47] and [08:48] get come to us and get the reward right [08:50] for us to pet them love them give them [08:52] cookies whatever motivates your dog [08:55] we want them to come complete the [08:57] behavior and come to us because we're [08:58] safe zone right if my dog is next to me [09:01] i can keep my dog safe now with that [09:03] said i want my dog to be able to roam [09:05] and go on hikes and have all this [09:07] freedom [09:08] but that e-collar gives me the safety to [09:11] understand to know that [09:13] at any moment i can reach out and touch [09:16] my dog right it's think about before we [09:17] had cell phones you didn't know god [09:20] forbid something happened you didn't [09:21] know that you know uh something happened [09:24] at home [09:25] or you had no information you have to go [09:27] find a pay phone check in now with cell [09:30] phones we have immediate [09:32] communication and that's basically what [09:34] the e-collar does it gives us that [09:36] immediate communication which is just it [09:38] it's so important for that timing of [09:41] training [09:42] and how does somebody go about getting [09:44] started with the remote training caller [09:46] i actually have a few people who have [09:48] been waiting for me to put up a video on [09:50] introducing the remote collar which i [09:52] haven't been able to get to yet and so [09:54] it's sitting at home it's in the box [09:56] they want to start using it even without [09:58] having a trainer right next to them to [10:00] show them what to do what could somebody [10:03] start doing right now to at least build [10:06] that strong positive association to the [10:08] remote collar or at least how do you [10:10] like to have your clients and people who [10:12] come to your training seminars approach [10:15] that process [10:16] so with without the guidance of a [10:19] professional trainer the first step i [10:22] would tell people to do that they [10:23] purchased their collar [10:25] now [10:26] put it in their hand [10:28] and very slowly turn the dial up very [10:31] slowly until you feel it [10:34] you should know what the stimulation [10:36] feels like before you ever put it on the [10:38] dog because you should understand the [10:40] communication and how they're going to [10:42] respond to it now if you put it in your [10:45] hand and you turn it up and it's and it [10:47] hurts it's too high [10:49] it's literally i when i do every owner [10:52] that works with me they have to feel the [10:55] collar before i'll put it on their dog [10:57] if they refuse to feel the collar i [10:58] refuse to train with them because if [11:00] they're willing to do it to the dog they [11:02] have to be able to feel it and it's the [11:04] main thing is to show them it's not [11:05] painful [11:06] it's just really annoying so we put it [11:09] in our hand and we slowly move up and [11:11] i'll tell people like you'll have a lot [11:12] of times you won't even feel it in your [11:14] palm so we use the palm because the palm [11:18] the skin on our palm is more like the [11:21] dog's neck skin as opposed to our skin [11:24] on our neck is more like um [11:27] the the skin on the dog's stomach right [11:30] we our neck skin is more sensitive their [11:32] stomach skin is more sensitive whereas [11:34] their neck dogs were bred to have [11:35] collars on and harnesses and all these [11:38] things they have all these muscles and [11:40] thicker skin [11:41] so we put in our hands so we can have [11:43] that feeling that the dog will feel and [11:46] we basically just slowly go up until we [11:48] feel it now everyone's going to be [11:50] different [11:51] everyone has different levels of pain [11:52] tolerance and when i use the word pain [11:54] tolerance because it's your body [11:57] recognizing something it's your body [11:58] telling you that it feels something you [12:00] put your hand over a hot stove [12:03] the nerve endings in your hand tell your [12:05] brain to move your hand away [12:07] right so the whole idea is we barely [12:10] want the dog to feel it it's just [12:11] supposed to be annoying [12:13] and we turn up until we feel it now [12:15] some people feel it i usually feel the [12:17] average collar i would say between like [12:19] 14 and 16 [12:21] is the lowest that i feel it and then i [12:24] can probably put it in my hand [12:27] till maybe [12:28] 20 [12:29] 30 before it starts to become really [12:31] annoying [12:32] but i have put the collar in my hand [12:34] many times and turned it to a hundred [12:36] and all you'll see is just my entire arm [12:39] flex because all it is is a muscle [12:41] stimulator it's just like a tens unit [12:44] that we use for rehab [12:46] i have really um bad backs from training [12:49] protection dogs and police dogs for so [12:51] many years in the bite suit and i use a [12:54] tens unit to flex my muscles and i'll [12:56] turn it to the highest level [12:58] and it it loosens up my back right it's [13:01] the same sensation that the dog feels [13:04] so first we want to get accustomed to [13:06] pressing the button [13:08] feeling in our hand [13:10] understanding how this [13:12] device works before we ever put it on [13:14] the dog now the first step of putting it [13:17] on the dog i first again like i said [13:19] before i want to make it a positive [13:21] experience so i'm gonna put it on my dog [13:24] and i'm gonna play ball with them [13:26] i'm not gonna even bring the remote with [13:28] me i don't need it i'm gonna give them [13:30] cookies i'm gonna put their collar on [13:32] and give them a bone [13:34] i want to create a positive association [13:36] with the collar as opposed to oh you're [13:39] you're being bad let's put the collar on [13:41] you now with that said oh yeah all i [13:44] have to do is show them the remote right [13:46] um which i've heard eight thousand times [13:50] from clients and i go [13:51] okay i'm happy that he's listening but i [13:53] don't want him to listen because you're [13:54] holding this remote i want him to listen [13:56] because you gave him a command and he's [13:58] listening to you [13:59] um [14:01] people that do use the collar in that [14:03] way of put the collar on the dog when [14:05] the dog's being bad it will work but [14:08] only when the dog is wearing the collar [14:11] so i always associate the e-collar as [14:14] training wheels on a two-wheel bicycle [14:18] you want to learn we start out with [14:19] tricycles right [14:21] then when we go to a two-wheel we start [14:22] out with training wheels and training [14:24] wheels are adjustable first we have them [14:26] all the way on the ground then we slowly [14:28] start raising them up to help us learn [14:30] our balance once we learn our balance we [14:32] take them off [14:34] so the goal of the e-collar is actually [14:36] to remove it [14:37] the goal is to not be reliant on it now [14:40] with that said i can walk my dog through [14:43] times square [14:44] off leash with no e-collar and i have no [14:48] questions in my mind [14:49] that she's gonna do anything wrong she's [14:52] gonna not listen to me she's gonna [14:53] listen to me perfectly but [14:55] i'm gonna have an e-collar on her for [14:56] safety because [14:59] god forbid something happens i can [15:02] control my dog but i can't control my [15:03] environment [15:05] so i what to say that another dog [15:07] doesn't come over and try to attack my [15:08] dog or people don't come over and try to [15:11] pet my dog when i didn't ask them to or [15:13] whatever the case may be so i have the [15:15] e-collar on for safety but [15:17] the goal is to eventually remove it in [15:19] the house because the dog loosens well [15:21] and then to have it in your pocket and [15:23] not even really need it you know it's [15:24] like um you know uh [15:28] like [15:29] carrying an ant antacid with you just in [15:31] case you got some heartburn [15:33] right like you know i know there's a [15:35] chance i'd rather have it with me than [15:37] not [15:38] yeah and something i tell people every [15:40] time i take my dogs out if i'm taking [15:42] them out to play fetch go on a hike [15:44] we're doing something fun the collar [15:46] goes on first and [15:47] i [15:48] almost can't even remember [15:50] the last time i actually had to use it [15:54] it's just there it's on them i still [15:55] have the remote with me just in case i [15:58] do need to use it in fact it was [16:01] probably about three weeks ago i was i [16:03] was at a local field and we were [16:05] finishing up playing fetch doing a [16:07] little bit of training and as we were [16:08] heading back there was a stray dog [16:11] and i called my dogs and to heal they [16:13] both got in the heel position and we [16:14] walked back to the vehicle and that was [16:17] it i didn't want that dog to approach [16:19] because i didn't want anything to happen [16:21] of course i don't know that dog it could [16:23] have been a neighbor's dog in that area [16:24] and at the same time i didn't want my [16:26] dogs running over to the dog because i [16:28] didn't know that dog so [16:30] even though i didn't have to use the [16:32] correction or the remote collar in any [16:35] sort of way of communicating often when [16:37] we train this way as you were saying our [16:39] dogs kind of develop that habit of doing [16:42] what we ask them to do [16:44] almost to the point where regardless of [16:46] what's going on in the environment [16:48] they'll still listen but it is important [16:50] as a responsible dog owner to have that [16:53] there just like people who have their [16:54] dog trained well on a leash their dog [16:57] may never pull but they still have the [16:58] leash on because they're supposed to [17:02] yeah just trying to create habitual [17:03] behaviors [17:05] and you know it's like um you know you [17:08] want to eat healthier right [17:11] you you start to do it and the more you [17:13] do it the better you get at it and the [17:15] easier it gets and then before you know [17:18] it you don't even have to question what [17:20] you're eating you just know what you're [17:21] supposed to eat and you know what's [17:22] right for you so it's it's so important [17:26] to create those consistent behaviors as [17:29] opposed to the way that i was [17:31] traditionally taught just like you was [17:33] to use a leash and a collar now when i [17:36] went to dog training school for my first [17:38] course we had to have a dog off leash [17:41] without the use of a remote training [17:43] cobbler we could only use training [17:45] regular only training collars [17:48] uh six foot leashes [17:50] you know uh tab leashes and then like [17:52] long lines 20 foot 30 foot hundred foot [17:55] lines [17:56] and [17:57] we had to do that in three months have a [17:59] dog fully off leash well [18:02] when i graduated they said well now go [18:05] and learn how to use remote training [18:06] collars and i said wait [18:08] you could have taught me how to do this [18:09] easier the whole time and they said yes [18:11] however we want to teach you [18:14] traditionally so that when you then go [18:16] and learn the easier techniques [18:19] it just makes your life easier but you [18:20] always have that foundation to go back [18:22] on now the average dog owner doesn't [18:25] need all of that [18:26] right the average dog owner just wants [18:29] to enjoy their dog [18:31] and part of enjoying your dog is your [18:33] dog being well behaved and listening [18:35] so [18:36] i don't need to sit there and teach them [18:39] five weeks of leash handling skills when [18:42] in five weeks i can have the dog fully [18:44] off leash with a remote training collar [18:46] and if they can use their cell phone [18:48] they're more than capable of using [18:50] an e-collar because usually it only has [18:53] three buttons [18:54] whereas my my phone had does you know 8 [18:57] 000 different functions right if you can [18:59] use i've taught little children i go can [19:02] you use the tv remote and they go yeah i [19:03] go okay i can teach you how to train the [19:05] dog [19:06] and i have a question when you we were [19:08] talking about introducing [19:10] the remote collar and creating that [19:12] positive association do you base it on a [19:15] certain amount of time let's say one [19:17] week two weeks of doing this or do you [19:20] base it on each individual dog i would [19:22] imagine that often it's easier to [19:24] present something black and white when [19:26] you're working with people who are not [19:28] dog trainers like hey do it minimum two [19:30] weeks do you have a certain process you [19:32] like to follow with that [19:33] so you know yes it is dog to dog case [19:37] but if i was gonna give a blanket [19:38] statement i would say two weeks [19:41] right so okay so it takes 21 days to [19:44] change a behavior [19:45] right [19:46] so you know two to three weeks [19:49] typically once after two or three weeks [19:52] you show that dog a collar and they get [19:54] super excited and it starts sending all [19:57] this dopamine in their brain of like [20:00] okay i'm gonna do something fun [20:02] so i would say about two weeks two to [20:04] three weeks i agree with that and people [20:06] often wanna rush training because they [20:09] wanna get that final picture they want [20:11] their dog to look like your dog and what [20:13] i always say is stop looking at that way [20:16] it's not like you're training a dog for [20:17] client that you have to get done in [20:19] three weeks or a month you're training [20:21] the dog for yourself but more [20:22] importantly it's really about developing [20:25] that strong relationship and giving that [20:27] dog everything that they need throughout [20:29] their lives so like with you i know you [20:32] continue to train your dogs all the way [20:34] up until the point they just physically [20:36] can't do it anymore because they love it [20:38] so much and it's that opportunity for [20:41] them to work with you and it's you know [20:43] something makes me think about when i [20:45] would do a stain train and i do the go [20:47] home lesson the owners are always like [20:49] it's amazing how the dog looks at you [20:52] and i said yeah because the past three [20:53] weeks we've been talking we've been [20:55] communicating with each other the dog's [20:58] like for once oh my gosh this person [21:00] understands me and if people just look [21:02] at training more so as an opportunity to [21:04] communicate with their dogs throughout [21:06] their entire lifetime now three weeks [21:09] two weeks seems like nothing [21:12] and it's worth going through that yeah [21:14] sorry go ahead [21:15] oh the god willing the dog's going to [21:16] live for 15 years [21:18] well it's two or three weeks [21:20] right [21:21] exactly so now they have the dog excited [21:25] about the remote training collar [21:27] and when you look up remote training [21:29] collar [21:30] training online what you often see and [21:33] you already hit on this a little bit [21:35] they'll say like oh put the collar on [21:37] hit the continuation button and then [21:40] turn it up until the dog does a reaction [21:42] okay good that's what i want to see so [21:45] how do you approach it [21:48] so [21:49] once we've found the the stimulation [21:52] that we feel [21:54] then the next step would be to find the [21:57] lowest level that the dog feels now the [22:00] dog is going to have what i call their [22:02] baseline which is the lowest level that [22:04] they feel but it is usually not [22:06] necessarily a level the dog will respond [22:09] to [22:10] meaning like you hear the little ringing [22:12] in the house [22:14] but it's so faint that it doesn't make [22:17] you go get up and figure out what is the [22:20] ringing sound [22:21] then the next level [22:24] that we would find for the dog is the [22:26] dog that the level that actually makes [22:27] them get up and look and go [22:30] what is that sound what what you know [22:32] what am i feeling [22:34] and then we pair that with a leash [22:36] and we show the dog how to turn off that [22:39] pressure so dogs have what's called [22:40] opposition reflex when you pull the dog [22:43] a dog pulls away from him when you push [22:44] a dog a dog pushes back into you it's [22:46] why every dog pulls on leash it's the [22:48] reason why we can connect a 35 pound pit [22:52] bull to a harness and it will happily [22:55] pull 3 500 pounds [22:57] because of that opposition [22:59] so i don't like to condition my [23:02] e-collars [23:03] paired with a prong collar i use a flat [23:06] collar something comfortable that i can [23:08] apply a little bit of pressure on the [23:10] neck and it's not going to hurt the neck [23:12] and i can actually guide the dog into [23:15] turn and come in my direction [23:18] so because we're using as negative [23:20] reinforcement negative reinforcement is [23:22] the removal of an annoying stimulus to [23:24] create and shape a desired behavior it's [23:27] before you get in your car you start [23:29] driving and you don't turn your seatbelt [23:31] you don't put your seatbelt on [23:33] right away every modern car is going to [23:34] go beep beep beep beep [23:36] the only way to get that annoying tone [23:39] to turn off is to reach over and put [23:40] your seat belt on [23:42] full [23:43] it was just annoying but you had no [23:45] decision as to when that started [23:47] you only had a decision as to when it [23:49] stopped by you performing an action so i [23:52] guide the dog [23:54] i tap the dog so i don't use continuous [23:57] for about 90 of my training i like to [23:59] use momentary because i can pretty much [24:02] just like [24:03] poke the dog on the shoulder now when [24:05] i'm working with my clients i want to be [24:07] able to give them as much information as [24:09] i can so let's say i'll say okay uh [24:12] tap tap tap it means i tap the button [24:14] three times [24:16] and then the next behavior tap tap tap [24:18] tap okay i had to press the button four [24:20] times there this time tap tap i only [24:23] have to press it two so i'm giving them [24:26] that information whereas with continuous [24:28] you hold it down you would have to then [24:31] start counting in your head per seconds [24:33] of how long did i hold the button down [24:36] because also the timing of doing this [24:40] when the dog starts to perform the [24:41] behavior automatically my finger can [24:44] come off of the button because i'd have [24:45] to re-initiate it by holding down [24:47] continuous the dog could start coming to [24:50] me and i'm still holding it [24:52] and then i have to take my finger off [24:54] because when it comes to come [24:56] the the stimulation stops when the dog [24:58] makes the decision to come in my [25:00] direction [25:01] not until the dog gets all the way to me [25:04] right so it's like um mom told you to go [25:06] clean your room [25:08] you went there but you kind of you know [25:10] you did like a you know you didn't do [25:11] that great of a job right so now you go [25:14] back she makes you go back because she [25:16] makes you redo it right and she's gonna [25:18] sit there and stand on top of you while [25:20] you do it right whereas if you condition [25:22] it properly okay go clean your room and [25:23] then when you're done cleaning your room [25:25] i have fresh baked cookies for you right [25:28] so it depends on what the dog's [25:30] motivated by [25:32] every dog is tactile every dog loves [25:34] affection [25:36] uh words of affirmation right they don't [25:38] necessarily understand what you're [25:39] saying but they understand your tone [25:41] good boy is a good girl right um so [25:44] when the dog comes to us [25:46] we give them a lot of love so i'm gonna [25:49] annoy you until you come to me but then [25:51] when you come to me i'm gonna love you [25:53] right i'm gonna annoy you into loving me [25:55] right but the idea is is that the dog [25:58] understands oh okay [26:00] if i come to you and i stay here i get [26:02] nothing but love and affection every [26:04] time i go away you're gonna annoy me [26:06] until i come back [26:07] from there now we create what we call [26:09] what i call like safe zone is the dog [26:11] learners okay stay in my city you'll get [26:14] nothing but love and cookies and i'm not [26:17] gonna tap you you'll feel no stimulation [26:21] then the next point is now the dog won't [26:23] leave your side and clients will call me [26:24] after a week one and they go [26:26] i i can't get the dog to leave me [26:27] meaning i can't even press the button [26:29] because the dog won't i said perfect [26:31] i'll see you you know tomorrow and i'll [26:33] come back and we do the next lesson and [26:35] now we teach the dogs to then go to [26:37] their bed [26:39] or climb or place wherever you're going [26:41] to call it okay now first the paladins [26:43] come to me [26:44] now the collar means go away from me [26:46] and then at an advanced level the collar [26:49] can also mean go left go right go [26:52] backwards [26:54] right so because it's the [26:56] non-directional stimulation it's not [26:58] like a lesion in collar that when i pull [27:00] it the dog feels it in a direction [27:02] the dog just learns to associate it with [27:05] the sound of our voice [27:06] so it doesn't pull them in any direction [27:09] it just teaches them to listen and [27:11] perform the conditioned behavior [27:14] yeah that's awesome there's two things [27:15] that you said that i love that's one of [27:17] the best analogies i've ever heard about [27:20] negative reinforcement and it's a great [27:22] way for people to understand it i also [27:24] like the fact that the negative [27:26] reinforcement in that example was sound [27:29] often people think that it always has to [27:31] be physical and it's like no just like [27:34] with positive punishment it doesn't have [27:35] to be something physical it could be a [27:37] loud noise we're still adding something [27:39] to the equation if the dog sees it as [27:40] punishment it's punishment and then [27:42] anytime something's taken away i'm [27:44] definitely going to be stealing that [27:45] from you and using that analogy i also [27:48] like the tapping as well [27:51] so [27:52] from what i've always heard as far as [27:54] implementing the remote caller's [27:55] negative reinforcement it's been the [27:56] continuation button now when we use the [27:59] continuation button it does do a tap tap [28:02] tap kind of feel but doing it manually i [28:04] think that's brilliant in so many ways [28:07] as you said it's easy to keep account of [28:09] what you're doing to transfer that over [28:11] to somebody else but it also prevents [28:13] the [28:14] more common mistake of holding it down [28:16] for too long [28:17] i mean that is excellent so now you have [28:20] it to where your clients the dogs [28:23] staying next to them now we're working [28:24] on getting the dogs to go away what are [28:26] some additional [28:28] tricks that you use for the [28:29] communication with the remote collar [28:32] so [28:34] what i like to do is a lot of times just [28:38] um [28:39] you know like i'm going to teach them [28:40] the place i'm going to lure them with [28:42] food [28:43] and i'm going to bring them on to the [28:44] place i don't want to initially tap them [28:46] to get on to place [28:48] because i don't want them to perceive [28:50] that like awesome spot like their bed as [28:53] something bad so i might take them with [28:56] a treat and lure them or guide them with [28:58] alicia onto the bed and then when they [29:01] go to get off just like um i always call [29:03] it like remember when you're a little [29:04] kid when you play the game uh the floor [29:06] is lava [29:08] right so every time they go to get off [29:10] we just tap them and guide them back on [29:13] and then they end up going oh oh so if i [29:16] just lay here and just relax like [29:19] everything's good [29:21] and you go yeah and they go okay and [29:23] they end up going to their bed and just [29:25] laying there right and as a professional [29:28] dog trainer that you know i train all [29:31] different genre of working dogs and pet [29:33] dogs but [29:34] on the pet side just being able to live [29:36] with a dog we can displace about 90 [29:39] percent of all negative behaviors in the [29:42] house [29:43] by using plates [29:45] because how can he jump on the counter [29:47] if he's laying on his bed how can he [29:49] bolt out the door [29:51] to chase the mailman if he's laying on [29:53] his bed you know um and you know it's so [29:57] impressive people come to your house [29:58] like uh you call the the doordash guy he [30:01] comes and he [30:02] you open up the door and the dog's just [30:04] laying there and he's like he's not [30:06] gonna move and i go no he's the there's [30:08] no reason to move right so it's so nice [30:11] first i taught him to come to me because [30:14] number one most important command that [30:16] you can teach your dog is come [30:19] sit doesn't matter down doesn't matter [30:22] place doesn't matter if your dog doesn't [30:24] know come because come will save their [30:26] life [30:27] now with puppies [30:29] ever what does everyone do they their [30:31] puppy runs away and they chase their [30:32] puppy [30:33] well that turns into chase games and the [30:36] dog goes ooh this is fun [30:38] well [30:39] i teach my puppy to chase me [30:42] and [30:43] i have had it actually save puppies [30:45] lives [30:47] because we teach them to chase us i had [30:50] a client when i was living in chicago [30:52] was walking their puppy down the block [30:55] the leash popped off the dog and the dog [30:57] started bolting towards the street [31:00] and perfect instinct he turned around [31:03] and just started running away down the [31:04] block and the dog go whoa daddy were you [31:07] going and came and followed him and he [31:09] was able to pick up the puppy [31:11] like think about from from cause and [31:14] effect from like life happens in an [31:16] instant [31:17] and god forbid bad thing like accidents [31:20] can happen in an instant but little [31:22] things like that can can do so much so [31:25] we teach the puppy to chase us now it's [31:28] the same thing with the remote collar [31:29] i'm always backing away from the dog [31:31] come come come follow me come chase me [31:34] come and meet me here right as opposed [31:37] to me going to them [31:39] they have to come to me to come and get [31:41] the reward i'm not going to come to them [31:42] and pay them they have to come to me to [31:44] get their payment [31:46] that's something that is real common too [31:49] where people instinctively [31:51] want to chase their dogs and it's not a [31:55] natural thing to go oh if i want the dog [31:57] to come to me i need to run away i need [32:00] to go in the opposite direction [32:01] something i always say to people is just [32:03] keep in mind whoever's the one being [32:05] chased is in charge of the game and then [32:08] of course another mistake people make is [32:10] when the dog does run away let's say in [32:12] their backyard or something like that [32:14] they're getting frustrated because [32:16] they're late for work the dog finally [32:18] comes to them and they correct the dog [32:21] and then they wonder why yeah exactly [32:23] they wonder why the dog doesn't come [32:25] back to you next time right exactly why [32:28] why would the dog it's like oh if i come [32:30] to you i'm punished same thing with you [32:32] know let's say a dog [32:34] has somebody's shoe in their mouth and [32:36] they're like give me the shoe and [32:37] they're fighting to get the shoe back [32:38] and the dog finally lets go of it goes [32:40] okay here you go and then they correct [32:42] the dog [32:43] the dog goes wait you don't want me to [32:45] let go of the shoe so next time hold on [32:48] to the shoe [32:49] more [32:50] you know it's those things about [32:51] communication which you know training [32:52] dogs for a long time it's almost at a [32:54] point well pretty much it is it comes [32:56] naturally but a lot of these common [32:58] mistakes it's important to address them [33:00] and bring them up so people know what to [33:03] do [33:04] oh for sure i always say that [33:07] humans are the only stupid animal that [33:10] will come to someone when they're mad at [33:11] them [33:13] right so like your mom's like you get [33:15] over here right now and you're like [33:17] and you come over whereas when the dog [33:20] when you're mad at the dog dogs like [33:21] okay i'm gonna be over here where you [33:24] can't touch me right or you can't be mad [33:26] at me i've had it happen before where [33:29] god forbid the dog got out and i chased [33:32] the dog to catch the dog and i finally [33:34] caught the dog and all i did was give [33:36] them love [33:37] my instincts tell me like oh you should [33:39] tell me he's bad but my training tells [33:42] me no tell him that he's good because i [33:44] was able to catch him and he was safe [33:46] it's hard to go against instinct but if [33:49] you think about it that way it's it like [33:52] it makes them want to come to you even [33:53] more right [33:55] yeah definitely something that i was [33:57] talking about in one of my live q and [33:59] a's the other day [34:01] i was telling the group that was [34:03] watching i said when you're training [34:04] your dog [34:05] no matter how difficult it may seem to [34:08] teach your dog a behavior or whatever [34:10] your dog is doing think to yourself [34:13] that your dog is trying the best he or [34:16] she can to learn what you want and i [34:18] said even if the dog stops and starts [34:20] smelling the ground yeah you want to get [34:22] the dog back and get that focus but [34:24] don't think of it as oh the dog's [34:26] ignoring me and smelling the ground [34:27] think maybe my dog has add and he can't [34:30] control that so let's get them back in [34:32] and let's work with them let's not have [34:33] the mindset where oh the dog's just [34:35] ignoring me or the dog doesn't want to [34:37] do it with all that being said i do want [34:39] to talk a little bit more about the [34:41] remote training collar what other [34:42] information tips and tricks that you can [34:44] provide [34:46] so [34:46] one of the first questions i ask people [34:49] before we start using the collar is [34:52] do you by any chance play an instrument [34:55] and [34:56] some people say yes some people say no [34:58] regardless most people know what a [34:59] metronome is [35:01] and a metronome sets pace you'll see it [35:03] sitting on the top of every piano [35:06] now even if people don't play [35:08] instruments i've never met anyone that [35:10] didn't like music [35:12] and every top 40 song that ever was [35:16] was a hundred beats per minute [35:19] to to [35:20] to to [35:22] to [35:23] now [35:24] if you're into reggae or [35:27] jazz 70 beats per minute [35:32] and then let's say you're into [35:33] electronic or edm [35:37] 120 beats per minute [35:39] so [35:40] the the the pace that i like to use is [35:42] 100 beats per minute [35:44] listen [35:47] pay attention pay attention pay [35:48] attention right and [35:50] the whole idea is there is that split [35:53] second between each tap to allow the dog [35:56] to make the decision to perform the [35:58] behavior the reason why [36:00] i'm not a huge fan of continuous [36:03] for [36:04] conditioning behaviors [36:06] is i could potentially stim the dog for [36:10] one or two extra seconds [36:12] that i didn't actually intend to because [36:15] it took me a second to take my finger [36:17] off the button whereas if i'm pulsating [36:20] i can [36:22] basically stop when i need to because i [36:24] want the dog to understand [36:26] the quicker you turn this off [36:29] the quicker you don't feel it and you [36:31] are in charge of your own destiny so [36:34] i'll have this happen a lot of times [36:36] i do lesson one and i explain i go over [36:39] the entire process this is how we use [36:40] the collar we're not using it as [36:42] punishment this isn't do it or else [36:45] because positive punishment the [36:47] application of a painful stimulus to [36:50] decreasingly decrease the likelihood of [36:52] the behavior which is like no stop don't [36:54] to be honest with you i very rarely use [36:57] the word no in my training because i [37:00] don't really use any punishment i don't [37:01] use negative punishment much which is [37:04] withholding something the dog likes [37:06] and i don't use positive punishment i [37:07] use positive reinforcement and negative [37:09] reinforcement so i prefer the two [37:11] motivators the two reinforcers to make [37:14] my dog more successful because i don't [37:16] want my dog to stop i want him to do [37:19] right and i wanted to do it as quickly [37:21] as possible because [37:23] punishment is never going to speed a dog [37:25] up all it's going to do is slow a dog [37:27] down [37:28] negative reinforcement the quicker i [37:30] turn the annoying tone off [37:32] the quicker i don't feel the stimulation [37:34] the quicker i get rewarded [37:36] so i'm going to do things quick right so [37:39] the example i use for people is the [37:41] difference between [37:43] a salary employee and a commission based [37:47] employee [37:48] the average dog owner treats their dog [37:52] as they work on for salary okay what's [37:56] your job my job as a dog is to be cute [38:00] um greet my owner when they come home [38:02] right play fetch with my owner very [38:05] basic needs [38:07] as opposed to [38:08] think about like a police dog or a [38:10] military dog or a service dog a working [38:13] dog works on commission [38:16] if he [38:17] or she doesn't you know the the more [38:19] they work the more they get paid if they [38:21] don't work they don't get paid now [38:24] what i do is i want the dog to think [38:26] about [38:27] the quicker i do the quicker i make my [38:30] sales the quicker i go home so if i [38:32] could tell you that [38:34] you have to sell ten thousand dollars [38:35] worth of dog collars a day [38:38] and [38:39] if you sell those ten thousand in the [38:42] first hour you go home you're done for [38:44] the day you met your quota you're done [38:47] now you could do [38:48] ten [38:49] thousand dollar sales [38:51] or i would just look for one person just [38:53] for their business training business [38:55] sell them ten thousand dollars worth of [38:56] dollars and then i'd go home so [38:59] my training sessions are dictated by how [39:02] the dog's responding to my communication [39:05] and the quicker that they learn to do [39:08] this the quicker they get the reward and [39:10] the quicker that the session is over so [39:13] like i have a new puppy [39:16] my puppy i'm looking for something in my [39:18] training session that i can jackpot i [39:20] can give him an entire handful of food [39:22] and i can tell him that he's the best [39:24] puppy in the world and then training's [39:25] over because i'm just trying to teach [39:27] him something [39:28] but he does something that i love i want [39:30] to make it such a huge big deal right [39:33] you know you do really well on a test [39:35] and mom and dad take you to the store [39:37] and buy you a toy as a reward [39:39] right they don't then make you go home [39:41] and study more [39:43] right you gotta you can study later but [39:44] for right now let's make this a reward [39:46] experience i tell my clients [39:49] when you're doing the e-collar 10 to 15 [39:52] minutes two to three times a day i don't [39:54] want you doing more than 15 minute [39:56] sessions and i don't want you training [39:58] the dog more than three times a day now [40:00] that's not including working on everyday [40:02] behaviors like calling the dog to you in [40:04] the house and things like that i'm [40:05] talking about designated i go out and i [40:07] do a training session because i want to [40:09] keep it fun i want to keep it [40:10] interesting keep it exciting i had a [40:13] client one time called me and i tell [40:15] every client i'm blue in the face 10 to [40:16] 15 minutes two or three times a day it's [40:19] part of the spiel right and i had a [40:21] client call me and she goes um my dog's [40:24] checking out and i said [40:26] i said in that 15-minute period your [40:28] dog's checking out she goes no well i'm [40:30] training him for about 45 minutes to an [40:32] hour and i go no [40:34] no he's checking out because he's bored [40:36] because this is no fun anymore right it [40:38] wasn't like oh cool mommy's gonna or [40:40] daddy's gonna be arithmetic you know [40:42] like this is like oh great we went on to [40:44] algebra and i'm over this [40:46] right and i said no no 10 to 15 minutes [40:49] two or three times a day and she said oh [40:52] i was trying to do extra credit i said [40:54] it it doesn't work that way dogs are [40:56] about time under like time under tension [41:00] meaning like as many reps as you can get [41:02] it's not about [41:04] you know like okay how many times can i [41:05] lift this barbell it's not about i'm [41:07] gonna lift the barbell and hold it up [41:08] for 45 minutes right we want to get as [41:11] many reps as we can to make the dog [41:13] successful [41:15] so that they understand the behavior so [41:17] i can get my 150 reps in but it's still [41:20] exciting it's not boring right when [41:23] training becomes boring i always feel [41:25] because i spend most of my year [41:28] traveling and training trainers and [41:30] helping people with their competition [41:32] dogs and helping service dog animals and [41:34] other trainers [41:36] like i want to keep it fun and exciting [41:38] if i ever feel like i'm bored i always [41:41] feel like the dog is bored and the dog [41:44] owner is bored and so and i you know i [41:47] don't have much attention so i want to [41:49] keep everything exciting and it keeps [41:51] the attention because the dog's [41:53] attention span is very short an adult [41:56] dog has max like a half an hour 45 [41:58] minutes of attention span so when we do [42:00] lessons i'm going to spend an hour with [42:02] the people but realistically we're going [42:04] to spend about 15 minutes 10-15 minutes [42:06] in the beginning going over everything [42:08] and then we're going to spend about 10 [42:09] to 15 minutes you know recapping [42:12] everything realistically the dog trains [42:14] for about half an hour when it comes to [42:15] puppies you're talking about maybe 5-10 [42:18] minutes before they're like oh i want to [42:19] go chase this leaf you know also when [42:22] we're using food when we fill the belly [42:24] then [42:25] you know the the desire goes away [42:28] you know if you [42:29] we go out like you know we had a great [42:32] interview we decide okay we're gonna go [42:34] out and we're gonna grab a steak [42:36] and [42:37] we're we're we leave the the restaurant [42:40] we're full [42:41] and you say okay jonathan there's a [42:43] there's a taco shop down the block you [42:45] dance the hokey pokey and i will buy you [42:47] a taco and i go come on nate i'm full i [42:49] don't i'm not dancing for you right now [42:52] if we're waiting online at the [42:54] steakhouse and they're like ah it's an [42:55] hour wait and i'm like man i haven't [42:57] eaten anything all day [43:00] and you're like ah dance with hokey [43:01] pokey i'll buy you a taco and i'm like [43:03] okay i'm dancing the hokey pokey right [43:05] so it's difference of level of [43:07] motivation the salary-based dog [43:11] gets their bowl in their food every [43:12] night right they get breakfast and they [43:14] get dinner it's always the same amount [43:16] it's always the same food [43:19] as opposed to the commission-based dog [43:21] has to work for their food now they [43:23] might still also get salary at the end [43:26] of the day my dog will still get their [43:28] bowl of food but during the day i'm [43:30] going to make them work for it and [43:32] depending on how they perform behaviors [43:34] i'm going to pay them throughout the day [43:35] because i want to raise that level of [43:37] motivation if we don't motivate the dog [43:40] then they have no desire right you have [43:43] to think about you know [43:45] do dogs love us [43:47] yes i think once you create a bond a dog [43:50] does love you but to say that dogs love [43:52] us off the bat it's not actually true [43:55] because dogs are animals and [43:58] they're they're resource animals and we [44:00] possess the resources so [44:02] you can say okay well i have your food [44:04] right some dogs come in for training and [44:06] they're not food motivated because [44:08] they've always just been given food [44:10] right now we say okay well now i'm gonna [44:12] make you work for food and they go well [44:14] my mommy and daddy don't make me work [44:15] for food right and it might take a [44:17] couple of days to them to understand oh [44:19] okay i'm no longer at a salary based job [44:22] now i work on commission i just have to [44:24] change how i feel about working because [44:27] everyone's got to get paid right [44:29] and the dog has to be paid for what [44:31] they're going to do but over time as you [44:34] train that dog as you spend time you [44:36] were saying before about the owners are [44:38] like well i just want to get the dog [44:39] trained and that's it well actually the [44:42] training is part of that bond it's that [44:44] communication it's when you know mom and [44:47] dad sat down with you [44:49] and helped you with your homework right [44:51] those are those bonding experience of [44:53] going over things or that tutor or that [44:55] that teacher that you had that put that [44:57] extra time with you to to help you [45:00] understand that's all the dog knows is [45:03] what you teach them [45:04] so [45:05] you're that catalyst to teaching the dog [45:08] create the best communication that you [45:10] possibly can [45:12] and as you said trying to cram [45:14] everything in one night is probably [45:16] gonna do more harm than good and [45:19] spreading it out throughout the dog's [45:20] life and if they're looking at that way [45:22] then it's not a rush for perfection but [45:24] rather opportunities to bond with the [45:26] dog and like you're saying with the [45:28] woman who's training for 45 minutes to [45:31] an hour yeah that could definitely do [45:33] more harm than good in fact when i was [45:35] going through school [45:36] one of the biggest critiques that the [45:38] instructors had against me or towards me [45:40] i should say not against me was that i [45:42] was over training [45:44] my dogs were shutting down because i [45:47] came into [45:48] dog training [45:50] fresh from being in the military as a [45:52] drill instructor so my mindset was it [45:54] died [45:56] say what [45:57] i said you're a really motivated guy oh [46:00] yes i really wanted to get it done and [46:02] i'm like well if they don't know it i'm [46:04] going to train all night until they have [46:06] it down and [46:07] i was still able to pass i did really [46:10] well throughout the course but if i was [46:11] to do it again i definitely wouldn't [46:13] have been putting that much pressure on [46:16] the dogs to try to learn so much in such [46:18] a short amount of time well this is [46:20] about the amount of time we have for our [46:22] session today are there any last little [46:25] golden nuggets that you have that you [46:26] want to share to my audience [46:28] if if you feel like you're struggling [46:32] with the communication [46:34] find someone that can help you [46:37] with that communication because everyone [46:39] needs a coach [46:40] everyone know there's never been anyone [46:43] that's been successful in life that [46:45] didn't have at least someone to help and [46:47] guide them and sometimes you just need [46:50] guidance when it comes to dog owners [46:52] some people need a little bit more help [46:54] they need things broken down a little [46:55] more some people can go a little bit [46:57] quicker the skill set of a dog trainer [47:00] is to be able to adapt their training [47:02] from person to person and train the [47:04] person and the dog in front of them so [47:06] if you're struggling [47:08] find someone that can help you because [47:10] like we don't throw the baby out with [47:12] the bath water right like [47:14] you know i just came back from a lesson [47:16] and the owner was really struggling [47:18] we're on lesson two and she was able to [47:21] walk her dog down the block and the dog [47:23] didn't try to go after and chase bunny [47:25] rabbits and didn't try to rip her arm [47:27] out of a socket to grab a duck [47:29] and she goes like i was really [47:31] struggling i i was even thinking about [47:33] getting rid of the dog now obviously she [47:35] never would have gotten rid of the dog [47:36] she loves the dog to death but that's [47:38] where your brain goes [47:40] she mentioned to a friend of hers who's [47:43] a friend of mine a previous client [47:46] that she's struggling and she said call [47:48] this guy he'll help you so everyone [47:51] needs a little bit of help i've had [47:53] coaches i have multiple mentors i only [47:56] got to my experience level by putting in [47:58] the time and learning from the people [48:00] with experience so if you're ever [48:02] struggling just search for the right [48:04] person [48:05] to help you and the key like for me a [48:08] lot of the way to understand who is the [48:11] right person look at their dogs look [48:14] about how their dogs respond to them [48:16] look at how their dogs react to them [48:19] and that will tell you a lot of how the [48:21] trainer is [48:22] because how they treat their own dogs is [48:24] usually how they're going to treat your [48:26] dogs and you as a person so don't if [48:28] you're getting frustrated don't stop [48:31] just say hey i need a little bit more [48:32] guidance i need a little bit more [48:34] training wheels before i'll be able to [48:35] balance on my own [48:37] i couldn't agree more and reaching out [48:39] when you need help i mean it doesn't [48:40] matter how long you've been training how [48:42] long you've been working on something [48:44] i've said this before in some of my [48:46] other interviews you know there's been a [48:48] few times where i called you up and we [48:49] were talking about a dog issue or [48:51] something it's something that we have to [48:52] do dave i had a you know interview with [48:54] him not too long ago dave van gaarder [48:56] and i still reach out to him it's [48:58] important to have these connections oh [49:00] yeah incredible as are you i've been [49:01] able to learn so much training from you [49:03] and learning from you and something i [49:06] want to provide my viewers is the [49:08] ability to reach out to you if they're [49:09] in your area or how can they find out [49:12] about your seminars that you've been [49:13] doing across the country and what are [49:15] the seminars that you're doing i know we [49:16] were talking about it before we started [49:18] the interview so i do a lot of [49:19] competition training [49:21] um i compete with my dogs in competitive [49:24] protection sports [49:25] um so a lot of people come to me for [49:28] competitive sport training but i also [49:30] train service dogs i do behavior [49:32] modifications seminars [49:34] right now i'm kind of focusing a little [49:36] bit more on helping the e-collar [49:39] community helping the dog training [49:42] and dog owner community communicate with [49:45] the eco a little better because i find [49:47] that [49:48] it's like there's so much information [49:50] out there but it's all kind of like so [49:52] vague [49:53] that it's hard to like really wrap your [49:55] head around it and the main reason that [49:58] wanted me to start and a youtube channel [50:02] was that i spent half of my year on the [50:05] road teaching and then i actually spent [50:07] half the year like giving information [50:09] away for free [50:11] and i said you know what if i'm gonna [50:13] give the information away for free i [50:16] think i should give it to everyone and [50:18] not just that one person because a lot [50:20] of times that one person [50:22] doesn't do anything with it or they take [50:25] you know they take it for granted [50:27] whatever the case may be [50:29] if i'm going to give it away i might as [50:30] well give it away to everyone because i [50:32] want to help dog owners as much as dog [50:35] owners want to help themselves and if it [50:38] turns out to them eventually training [50:40] with me that's awesome but if it turns [50:42] out to them just having a better [50:43] relationship with their dog [50:45] that's also phenomenal too so i'd rather [50:48] just you know it's like um marcus [50:50] iridius said right like uh get give it [50:52] to the people right so for me dog [50:55] training is just is such a passion of [50:57] mine [50:58] and i i coach trainers from around the [51:00] country and [51:02] you know most of it i do for the love of [51:06] the training making the dogs better and [51:08] them you know and if it turns into them [51:11] bringing me out for a seminar or you [51:13] know sending me a client or something [51:15] that's awesome but the most important [51:16] thing is that the knowledge is out there [51:19] yeah one of the things that i've always [51:21] liked to do same kind of perspective [51:23] that you have and what was my mission [51:24] statement still is [51:26] to improve the quality of life for all [51:28] dogs by educating those that care for [51:30] them so i absolutely love that i love [51:32] that you mentioned marcus aurelius as [51:34] well i'm a huge fan of stoic philosophy [51:36] i think i have about 15 books [51:38] entertainment [51:40] love love stone philosophy so where can [51:43] they find you i'm going to put all the [51:44] information in the description of this [51:46] video uh but you have a website or what [51:49] what sources to reach out to you [51:51] directly you can follow me on instagram [51:54] my instagram is catsknowsdogs which is [51:57] k-a-t-z [51:59] k-n-o-w-s-d-o-g-s [52:01] um you'll see [52:02] a lot of you'll see a lot of dog stuff [52:04] you'll see a lot of leather work is my [52:07] uh hobby if you can't see i'm in my [52:09] leather shop right now um [52:12] and uh it's just kind of fun stuff [52:14] um uh look out for when the youtube [52:17] channel's coming i don't have a website [52:20] and it's kind of on purpose because [52:23] i don't really have time to [52:25] you know work with all the clients that [52:27] i have now [52:29] and the hard part about having a website [52:31] is people are going to constantly reach [52:33] out to you and i just don't have the [52:35] time to answer everyone just because i'm [52:38] one person [52:39] and [52:40] it's i find it really rude to reach out [52:42] to a business and that they don't [52:44] respond to you right so for me [52:47] um reach out to me on social media and i [52:50] definitely i respond to everyone um [52:53] but you know as stuff comes along you [52:56] know you'll see i post about my seminars [52:58] and things like that most of the [53:00] pet dog training i do is through uh word [53:03] of mouth [53:04] because [53:06] people that come to me have already [53:08] trained their friends or relatives or [53:11] whoever [53:12] have already trained with me so they [53:14] kind of understand i i take training [53:16] very seriously i have fun with it but i [53:18] take it seriously and i refuse to work [53:21] with owners that aren't going to put the [53:23] time in [53:24] so because it's a disservice to the dog [53:27] it's a disservice to me and my knowledge [53:30] so i like people to come that already [53:33] serious and really want to get things [53:35] done because [53:36] that's like if we're going to spend the [53:38] time let's do it right [53:40] right so [53:41] um you know but yeah definitely uh [53:44] instagram is probably the best way to [53:45] reach out to me and you were talking [53:47] earlier about one of your goals of [53:50] setting up a school for professional dog [53:52] trainers do you have anything right now [53:55] as a resource for dog trainers out there [53:57] that perhaps want to improve on their [53:59] skills and their knowledge for the dog [54:01] industry [54:02] so [54:03] um that's where i'm like the youtube [54:05] channel is going to kind of be the start [54:06] of that i do a lot of virtual lessons [54:08] with clients um people you know trainers [54:11] or just private dog owners that i'm [54:13] coaching from a distance just because we [54:15] have a limitation of distance um but [54:19] i'm gonna basically my first goal is to [54:22] give the information out for free [54:24] and then down the road ready to actually [54:27] open up a shop um you know we met when i [54:30] was in chicago i had a huge training [54:32] facility i had multiple trainers i had a [54:35] ton of dogs in the kennel for training [54:37] and it ended up becoming into me just [54:40] running a business and not being a dog [54:41] trainer [54:42] and i quit being a chef [54:45] to be a dog trainer because i love dogs [54:47] and so i had to get away from that [54:50] aspect of the business so i could [54:51] actually focus on the dog training so [54:54] that's the hard part about being one guy [54:56] but [54:56] when i'm one guy i know that i can get [54:59] everything in my capabilities done and [55:01] the dogs have trained well [55:03] and you know everything goes as as best [55:06] as it can right as opposed to [55:09] managing people and things like that so [55:11] eventually down the road when i'm ready [55:13] but my first goal is i want to give out [55:15] informational [55:17] uh to the point [55:19] like almost how to [55:21] you know kind of for dummy videos which [55:24] can really help people be more [55:25] successful [55:26] and and communicate with their dog [55:28] better [55:29] and you're an excellent instructor the [55:32] things that i've learned from you so i [55:34] know that this youtube channel is going [55:36] to be an incredible resource [55:38] once you get it going please let me know [55:41] because i'll post the heck out of it on [55:42] my youtube channel and as i said before [55:44] hopefully we can get together and do a [55:46] couple videos for my channel as well to [55:48] send more people to your channel because [55:51] of course the more we can learn and i [55:53] say that is everybody watching because [55:54] everybody watching even if they're not a [55:56] professional dog trainer they're a dog [55:58] trainer and we can continue to grow [56:01] together so train your dog you're a dog [56:03] trainer [56:04] absolutely you're an absolute dog [56:06] trainer but you're still a dog trainer [56:07] and that's what i tell people every time [56:09] i work with them so thank you so much [56:11] john i really appreciate i really [56:12] appreciate you taking the time yeah this [56:14] was awesome [56:16] let's do it again ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 381/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:01] [Music] [00:11] out [00:13] here [00:16] we'll break down competitive retrieval [00:17] training into 10 simple steps this [00:20] training can also help those of you that [00:21] are in the process of training a service [00:23] dog as many service dogs are required to [00:26] know how to pick up dropped items when [00:28] starting out you may want to use an item [00:31] that you won't mind getting damage from [00:32] chewing or biting for example many [00:35] trainers like to start with a plastic or [00:37] wooden dowel once your dog understands a [00:39] concept you can progress to an obedience [00:42] dumbbell or items you may want a service [00:44] dog to retrieve in today's demonstration [00:47] i'll be using an obedience dumbbell from [00:49] j j dog supplies they are my go-to for [00:52] agility and competition training [00:54] equipment if you want to get one for [00:56] yourself i'll be sure to place a link in [00:58] the description of this video [00:59] first we're going to bring the object [01:01] out and move it in a way that will get [01:03] our dog to bite at it once they do use [01:06] your marker and reward since we're not [01:08] using a command when we start the [01:10] process you can use either the [01:12] continuation marker or the terminal [01:14] marker if you don't know what a marker [01:16] is i'd recommend checking out my video [01:18] titled marker dog training and the four [01:21] quadrants of opera conditioning if your [01:23] dog doesn't attempt to grab the item [01:26] move it away from them to kick in that [01:28] natural prey drive in addition have the [01:30] item behind your back before you present [01:34] it to your dog you want to work on this [01:36] step until it seems as though your dog [01:38] understands the concept of grabbing the [01:40] item when presented make sure you keep [01:42] the sessions nice short and fun it [01:45] should look something like this [01:49] free good [01:53] free [01:54] very good [01:57] free [01:58] excellent [02:02] free [02:02] good girl [02:07] free very good [02:09] the second step is very comparable to [02:11] step one the only difference is that [02:13] you're going to change the position of [02:15] the item each time you bring it out to [02:17] present it to your dog it should look [02:19] something like this [02:21] free [02:24] free [02:26] free [02:30] free [02:32] for the third step we'll ask our dog to [02:34] calmly hold the item in their mouth once [02:36] a dog takes the article keep one hand [02:38] underneath the chin and one on top of [02:41] the head to prevent the dog from [02:42] dropping it if the dog drops the item [02:45] calmly place it back in the dog's mouth [02:47] don't stress out as this can often [02:49] happen in the early stages while the dog [02:51] is holding the object we're going to [02:53] calmly pet and praise our dog after a [02:56] few seconds use your marker and reward [02:59] the climb platform that you see me using [03:01] in this video comes from the petcock [03:03] company hands down one of my favorite [03:05] dog beds and climb platforms i'll be [03:07] sure to add a link in the description of [03:09] this video [03:10] good [03:12] very good [03:17] free [03:18] nice work [03:22] in step four we want our dogs to walk [03:24] with the object in their mouth i like to [03:26] do the backwards follow exercise during [03:28] this step when you first start you may [03:31] need to continually pet your dog as you [03:33] did in the previous step while you're [03:35] walking keep in mind it's about [03:37] developing the muscle memory for our dog [03:39] to hold the article while walking and [03:42] then sitting in front of the handler to [03:44] complete the process once you stop [03:46] walking ask your dog to sit and then [03:48] either use your terminal marker and take [03:50] the item or ask your dog to drop the [03:53] item then mark and reward [03:57] good very good [04:02] free [04:03] excellent [04:06] step 5 starts with the backwards follow [04:08] exercise with minimal to no additional [04:10] help once you can get your dog to [04:12] successfully perform that exercise we'll [04:15] start asking our dog to perform other [04:17] commanded behaviors with the object in [04:19] their mouth this helps teach the dog to [04:22] continue holding the item regardless of [04:24] what barriers may stand in the way which [04:27] transfers over nicely when we start [04:29] training our dog to perform the retrieve [04:32] over the high jump now this step isn't [04:34] 100 necessary but i personally found [04:37] more success with the retrieval training [04:39] process by incorporating this into the [04:42] training [04:45] sit [04:46] heel [04:48] down [04:50] come [04:54] free [04:55] excellent very good [04:58] sit [04:59] stand [05:01] spin [05:03] down [05:04] come [05:07] free very good ari step six we want to [05:11] ask our dog to start picking up the item [05:13] off the ground when i first start this i [05:16] like to place the object on the ground [05:17] while still maintaining contact with it [05:20] this helps make the pitcher look more [05:22] familiar to the dog since they're used [05:24] to taking the item from our hand as your [05:26] dog progresses slowly start to move your [05:29] hand away from the item as your dog goes [05:32] to retrieve it [05:36] good free [05:44] free [05:52] free [05:54] in step seven we'll start throwing the [05:56] item and allowing our dog to retrieve it [05:58] while it's still moving this step is [06:00] helpful since it's much easier for us to [06:02] have our dogs retrieve an item that's in [06:04] motion instead of asking them to perform [06:07] the exercise after the object has [06:09] stopped moving which is required on the [06:12] final stage [06:16] good [06:19] free very good ari [06:26] very good [06:29] free [06:30] nice [06:38] free good girl [06:41] step eight we'll simply go through all [06:43] the previous steps but this time we'll [06:45] be adding the command before we present [06:48] the physical cue [06:49] bring [06:51] free [06:52] bring [06:53] free [06:57] bring [06:58] free [07:00] bring good [07:03] very good [07:06] bring [07:08] good very good [07:11] bring [07:14] sit heel [07:18] down [07:19] come [07:21] bring [07:24] free [07:26] bring [07:28] good girl [07:32] free [07:33] very nice [07:34] during step nine we'll place our dog [07:36] into a sit stay set the article on the [07:39] ground then ask our dog to bring it to [07:41] us each time we'll place the item [07:43] farther and farther away from our dog [07:49] bring [07:51] good [07:52] free very good ari [07:59] bring [08:03] free very good [08:12] bring [08:18] free [08:19] very good [08:30] bring [08:38] out heel [08:42] free good girl [08:44] step 10 we'll put it all together for [08:46] the final picture if you've done the [08:48] first nine steps correctly then this [08:50] step should be pretty smooth if you [08:52] notice that your dog is struggling then [08:54] go back to the appropriate step in the [08:56] training that will help your dog [08:58] overcome the struggle for example if [09:00] your dog is having a hard time coming [09:02] back to the sit front position then work [09:04] on the backwards follow exercise in step [09:07] five [09:11] bring [09:18] out [09:20] heel [09:22] thank you for watching but before you [09:24] leave i would like to announce the [09:26] launch of ari and charlie's freeze-dried [09:28] dog food our food starts with high [09:30] quality fresh raw meat bones and

off with a [00:05] question that was recently asked as far [00:07] as building toy drive or play drive in a [00:10] dog if you have a dog that just doesn't [00:12] have that natural play drive that some [00:14] dogs do there are a few things you can [00:16] do to try to increase that play drive [00:19] but there is no guarantee one of the [00:22] exercises i like to do if at first [00:24] trying something like using a flirt pole [00:27] or perhaps a ball on a rope where you [00:30] can kick in the dog's natural play drive [00:32] and encourage them to play and chase [00:34] if that's not something that's working [00:36] then what you can do is what's known as [00:38] drive building so drive building is a [00:40] pretty simple process of course if [00:43] you're doing it for a specific sport or [00:45] something like that then there's going [00:47] to be a little bit more involved but if [00:49] you're just trying to get your dog to [00:50] play very simple very straightforward [00:52] you take your dog you put on a harness [00:55] or an agitation collar so the dog's able [00:58] to pull i showed an example of this in [01:00] my how to teach your dog how to bark [01:03] episode where [01:05] sergio is holding the leash and i'm [01:06] teasing harley with a toy to get her [01:09] excited and to get her to bark and then [01:11] i reward her with the toy [01:14] excuse me you can do it by yourself [01:16] simply hook your dog onto a back tie [01:18] usually a tree or something like that [01:21] make sure your dog has on the harness or [01:22] the agitation collar and start to tease [01:25] your dog with the toy once your dog gets [01:28] excited enough and shows interest then [01:30] reward your dog with that sort of [01:32] movement so what i like to do [01:36] if you've seen the movie bolt [01:38] i like to pretend that the dog i'm [01:40] training has a super bark so i bring the [01:43] toy out the dog barks or makes a little [01:45] bit of noise and i react to it so then [01:47] the dog starts to realize oh wow i can [01:49] have an impact on this game they bark [01:52] more i bring it closer and closer and [01:53] closer up until the point where i'm [01:55] rewarding the dog with the toy now once [01:58] i give the dog the toy and they bite it [02:00] i pull right away to make sure that the [02:02] dog holds on nice and tight you don't [02:04] want them to bite and then hold it [02:06] loosely so once they bite you pull [02:08] to make sure the bite is seated nice and [02:10] tight and then you can pet the dog and [02:12] try to engage and make it fun and active [02:15] same way you would if you're playing tug [02:17] if you give your dog a toy to play with [02:20] and then you just release it it's not [02:22] going to be as fun as if as if you're [02:24] actively engaged with the dog [02:27] once the dog drops it if they do then [02:29] you pull it away very quickly and you [02:31] start to tease them again with the toy [02:33] so we're using frustration we're using [02:35] this [02:36] uh tool of teasing them in order to get [02:38] them to want to play and then we're [02:40] showing them how fun it is to play now [02:43] keep in mind you can do this exercise [02:45] with a dog but just like with people [02:47] each dog is going to be different so [02:50] there are dogs that i've come across in [02:51] the past that just simply don't have any [02:54] interest in playing with toys and if [02:56] that's the case then it's possible that [02:58] you have a really nice [03:01] couch movie [03:02] couch potato movie friend whatever you [03:04] want to call it where they can hang out [03:06] and just relax and that's okay too [03:08] all right so [03:09] i can't see the questions that are [03:11] popping up on here so i'm also going to [03:12] pull up the video [03:14] on my computer so i can see what [03:16] questions are coming through [03:21] okay excellent how can i get my [03:24] five-month-old german shepherd dog to [03:25] stop tearing up my plants [03:28] okay if you have a dog practicing a [03:30] behavioral issue if the behavioral issue [03:32] is dangerous or destructive i correct it [03:35] right away that's what i do i don't want [03:37] to wait to see if the dog is going to [03:39] destroy more things or be more [03:40] destructive [03:42] the easiest way to do that is to set [03:43] your dog up to fail if you know your [03:46] dog's going to do a certain behavior [03:48] that you don't like [03:49] don't avoid it rather put your dog in [03:51] that situation so the moment they do the [03:54] behavior that you don't want you can [03:56] follow up with a correction i like to [03:58] use the word no as my condition punisher [04:01] now i know that sounds bad that's the [04:04] technical terminology it means a marker [04:07] that predicts positive punishment [04:09] remember positive punishment is anything [04:11] we add to the equation to stop a [04:14] behavior so as long as the motivation [04:16] not to receive the correction overrides [04:18] the motivation for the dog to do the [04:20] behavior then we've successfully [04:22] accomplished what we're trying to do by [04:23] implementing that correction now there's [04:25] a couple things that can create issues [04:27] when we do add correction so you want to [04:29] make sure you're not doing these common [04:31] mistakes one don't ever make a [04:33] correction personal meaning don't yell [04:35] and get frustrated at your dog because [04:37] that's going to take them out of a clear [04:39] mental state they're not going to be [04:41] thinking properly therefore they're not [04:42] going to learn we don't want to scare [04:44] our dogs this is cause and effect [04:46] in addition you want to make sure that [04:48] the correction comes the moment the dog [04:50] is doing the behavior now you can [04:52] deliver the primary correction which [04:53] would be something like perhaps a leash [04:55] pop or even a remote training collar the [04:58] exact moment the dog does behavior but [05:00] more often than not we're not able to [05:02] deliver the primary correction the [05:05] moment the dog does the behavior that's [05:06] why we have our conditioned correction [05:08] or our condition punisher the moment the [05:11] dog does the behavior you can say no [05:13] that's the word i like to use i follow [05:15] up with the correction the moment the [05:17] dog stops doing the behavior yay good [05:20] pup and then i reward them so then they [05:22] learn not to ch chew or dig into the [05:26] plants just make sure you correct them [05:27] now the moment sorry the more your dog [05:31] has been practicing a behavior the more [05:33] you'll have to correct the dog in order [05:35] to stop the behavior this is why working [05:37] with puppies is so nice because it's a [05:39] clean slate that whole concept of you [05:41] can't teach an old dog new tricks isn't [05:44] true but it does come into play when [05:46] we're trying to stop certain behavioral [05:48] issues that our dogs have been [05:50] practicing for a long time so if you [05:52] have a dog that is let's say five years [05:54] of age and that dog has been chewing in [05:57] the backyard the entire five years are [05:59] not chewing i'm sorry digging in the [06:01] backyard for the entire time that dog [06:03] has been alive [06:04] now trying to stop that five-year-old [06:06] dog from practicing that behavior is [06:08] going to be way more difficult than if [06:11] we were able to stop at the moment the [06:13] dog first attempted that behavior when [06:15] they were a puppy [06:16] okay let's see what other questions we [06:18] have [06:21] i have an eight-week-old legato i think [06:24] that's how you pronounce those dogs [06:25] really interesting dogs and he shakes [06:27] when he sees other dogs normal that [06:30] could be excitement that could be [06:31] frustration it could be anxiety if [06:34] you're running into certain behaviors [06:36] that could seem like fear or anxiety or [06:38] stress or frustration then you want to [06:40] use counter conditioning and [06:42] desensitization it works like a charm so [06:45] it's something where a dog is becoming [06:46] reactive to other dogs [06:48] what i like to do is i take them to a [06:50] local dog park i make sure that i'm far [06:52] enough away from the dog park i don't go [06:54] into the dog park i make sure i'm far [06:56] enough away from the dog park that the [06:58] dog i'm working with is not having a [07:00] negative reaction to the dogs that he or [07:03] she is seeing [07:04] once i determine that distance then i do [07:06] something that the dog enjoys whether [07:08] it's obedience a little bit of play i'm [07:11] creating a strong positive association [07:13] to the elements in the environment that [07:15] may be causing any sort of stress or [07:17] anxiety or frustration to the dog that [07:19] i'm working with and over time we get [07:22] closer and closer to the dog park up [07:24] until a point where i'm right next to [07:26] the dog park the dog is actively engaged [07:29] with me and we're not seeing any of [07:31] those behaviors that we saw previously [07:34] because we've desensitized our dog to [07:37] that situation and we've done the [07:39] counter conditioning by pairing it with [07:42] something that the dog enjoys that [07:44] strong positive association [07:46] okay let's see what's next [07:49] uh [07:51] can you give a lesson with all verbal [07:53] cue matched with hand signals [07:56] i'm not sure i completely understand [07:58] that question [08:00] uh a verbal so a verbal command it [08:03] wouldn't be a cue it would be a command [08:05] so something verbal wouldn't be a cue [08:08] because our dogs learn through physical [08:11] communication [08:12] so that's why anytime we're teaching a [08:14] dog a new behavior we have to be able to [08:17] provide some sort of physical cue that [08:20] can get the dog to do the behavior [08:23] although once a dog does know something [08:26] we can use that to help teach new [08:29] behaviors and this is something that's [08:31] very interesting [08:32] this is a concept that i've come up with [08:35] recently [08:37] jokingly when i would take my dog's [08:39] training collar off i would grab the [08:41] collar and i would say one two three and [08:44] i would take the collar off after enough [08:47] of those what do you think happens [08:49] when you say or when i would say one [08:52] well if you've guessed it correctly then [08:55] you would have said the dog reacts or [08:56] responds the moment you say wonder the [08:58] moment i would say one to ari so i would [09:00] grab her collar i'd say one and she'd [09:02] pull her head out she wouldn't wait for [09:04] me to go down the line two three and [09:06] then remove the collar [09:08] this is something that you can think [09:09] about when you're teaching your dog a [09:11] new behavior whatever comes in the slot [09:13] one [09:14] that's going to end up being the command [09:16] and it could be anything i also talk [09:17] about this as questions and answers we [09:20] ask our dogs a question and then we [09:22] provide the answer after enough [09:25] repetitions when we ask the dog the [09:27] question before we provide them with the [09:29] answer they give us the answer [09:32] oh thank you for that i appreciate it [09:35] so then they will give us the answer [09:38] before we give them the answer and [09:40] that's something that lets us know as [09:42] the trainer that the dog now knows the [09:44] command on the verbal command however we [09:47] can also use this to teach new tricks or [09:50] behaviors so for example in akc [09:52] obedience one of the exercises at the [09:55] higher level the utility routine is to [09:57] get our dog to do behaviors with hand [09:59] signals and this isn't the typical hand [10:01] signals that we might use when we're [10:03] training a dog like pointing to their [10:04] climb bed or pointing to the down to get [10:07] the dog to sit or lifting our hand up to [10:09] get the dog's muzzle to go up so their [10:11] butt goes down but something a little [10:13] bit more [10:14] complex as far as getting a dog to [10:16] respond to it for example what's [10:18] commonly used for the down is raising [10:20] your hand in the air and then the dog [10:22] sees that and they go into the down [10:23] position [10:24] well if your dog already knows the [10:26] verbal command down you can use that to [10:29] teach the dog the hand signal by placing [10:32] the hand signal in the slot where the [10:33] one would be if we're talking about the [10:35] one two three so this would be one [10:38] two would be down [10:40] dog does the behavior we mark in reward [10:44] so we do this enough times and [10:46] eventually what happens we raise our [10:47] hand in the air the dog says the next [10:49] thing you're going to do is you're going [10:51] to tell me to down i know this based on [10:53] pattern recognition [10:54] then the dog goes into the down before [10:56] we give them the verbal command so our [10:59] dogs learn very well through that [11:01] concept of pattern recognition i do this [11:03] all the time to teach dogs new behaviors [11:06] if i know they know one behavior i can [11:08] use that to very easily teach a new [11:10] behavior another example where i would [11:12] do this is for the send out if the dog [11:15] knows the climb command i go right next [11:17] to a climb platform i point in the [11:19] direction of the climb platform usually [11:21] using a knife hand shape and then i tell [11:24] the dog run [11:25] climb so then the dog hears run and then [11:28] climb [11:29] the dog goes on the climb and then i [11:31] build distance each time [11:33] a little farther away from the climb [11:34] platform so eventually i'm 30 40 50 feet [11:37] away from the climb platform i say run [11:39] the dog takes off assuming i'm going to [11:41] tell the dog to climb and they'll run [11:44] looking for that climb platform so we're [11:46] able to teach something by using [11:48] something the dog already knows okay [11:50] let's see what else we have [11:52] oh and also quick announcement if you [11:54] haven't seen it already the freeze-dried [11:57] dog food that we have we only have one [11:59] protein source right now which is the [12:01] salmon it is available re and [12:04] charlies.

my dog jumps at people to say hi what [12:53] i've done is to tell her to sit what she [12:56] does but after people say hi she jumps [12:58] again how can i keep her calm if your [13:01] dog knows the behavior so a video i [13:03] recommend checking out is if this then [13:05] that with the behavioral modification [13:07] flow chart i do have it i'll post it [13:10] right now [13:13] in the questions area so if you don't [13:14] know where it is it is easier for me to [13:16] find videos considering i do know the [13:18] channel but it's known at it's called [13:21] the behavioral modification flow chart [13:24] and it lets you know what to do [13:26] depending on a specific situation [13:28] so with this [13:30] i always start if it's something that's [13:31] not dangerous or destructive and this [13:32] falls under a behavioral issue jumping [13:34] up on people then i like to first unless [13:37] of course [13:38] you're around maybe [13:40] an elderly person or a child of course [13:42] jumping up at that point could be [13:44] potentially dangerous [13:47] but what i do is i use my marker that [13:49] predicts negative reinforcement again [13:51] that's leash pressure we turn pressure [13:52] on when the dog complies we turn it off [13:55] i like to use this for all kinds of [13:57] different situations when i'm teaching [13:59] the dog rules and boundaries without [14:01] wanting to implement any sort of [14:03] correction i don't like to use a [14:05] correction on a dog [14:08] keeping aside dangerous or destructive [14:09] behaviors anything else i want to make [14:11] sure the dog knows the rules and [14:13] expectations before they receive a [14:15] correction [14:16] and this is really important we don't [14:18] want to correct a dog without them [14:20] knowing [14:21] what the rules are so i use a word that [14:24] predicts negative reinforcement now [14:25] remember in order for a marker to be a [14:27] marker by definition it must predict one [14:30] of the four quadrants of opera [14:31] conditioning positive and negative [14:33] reinforcement positive and negative [14:35] punishment i use the word wrong you can [14:37] use whatever words you like as a marker [14:40] for negative reinforcement leash [14:41] pressure so for example when i'm [14:43] teaching a stay the dog breaks the stay [14:45] instead of correcting the dog for that [14:47] since they don't know this day yet i say [14:49] wrong which pinpoints the moment in time [14:51] they made the mistake and then i take [14:53] the leash and i guide them back onto the [14:54] platform the dog goes into a door or a [14:58] room rather that the dog's not allowed [15:00] into perhaps an office or nursery or [15:02] something like that the moment the dog [15:04] walks through the doorway i say wrong i [15:06] use a leash i guide the dog back out of [15:08] the room i release the leash pressure [15:11] good dog the dog comes up on the [15:12] furniture wrong i use a leash i guide [15:15] the dog off of the bed you can start to [15:17] see how this is very transferable to [15:19] behaviors that we don't learn about to [15:21] do now if you use negative reinforcement [15:23] correctly it should not create any sort [15:26] of stress [15:27] or discomfort to our dogs because they [15:30] should understand leash pressure before [15:32] we start implementing this and i have [15:34] videos on how to teach a leash pressure [15:36] so when we use leash pressure remember [15:39] we're presenting a problem this is when [15:40] we're first teaching our dog leash [15:42] pressure we're presenting a problem [15:44] we're saying do you know what to do when [15:45] i apply this pressure [15:47] and the dog doesn't know what to do so [15:48] then right after we apply the pressure [15:50] we use the food lure to place the dog [15:53] into the desired position so we're [15:55] essentially giving the dog the answer [15:57] we're giving them the solution to the [15:59] problem and we do this over and over [16:01] again [16:03] up until the point where we turn on the [16:04] pressure and the dog instantly responds [16:06] then we can start using this in these [16:08] different situations i also like to use [16:11] this when a dog jumps up on somebody [16:13] we're going to use a combination of [16:15] negative punishment which is the removal [16:18] of a reward and negative reinforcement [16:20] which is we turn pressure on when they [16:22] comply we turn it off so what we do i [16:25] always like to tell the person who's [16:26] helping me with the training i say when [16:28] my dog jumps up just stop petting as [16:30] long as all four paws are on the ground [16:32] you can go ahead and pet the dog and [16:34] they got it got it great i bring the dog [16:36] up the moment the dog jumps up they stop [16:39] petting there's that negative punishment [16:41] i say wrong i apply the leash pressure [16:44] the dog places all four paws back on the [16:47] ground i turn off the pressure there's [16:49] the negative reinforcement and then the [16:52] human who's helping me goes right back [16:54] to petting the dog applying positive [16:56] reinforcement so in that situation we're [16:59] using three of the four quadrants of [17:01] upper condition this is very very [17:03] powerful i continue to do that up until [17:06] the point where the dog jumps up on [17:08] somebody i say wrong and the dog jumps [17:11] off instantly on their own and i do this [17:13] with all sorts of behaviors that i would [17:15] be using this technique such as jumping [17:17] up on furniture [17:19] once the dog demonstrates that that's [17:21] given me a really good understanding or [17:23] not a really good understanding a really [17:25] good perception of the dog knowing what [17:28] the rules and expectations are once i do [17:30] that then i tell myself the next time [17:32] time the dog jumps up it's not going to [17:34] be wrong now it's going to be a no and [17:37] it's going to be followed by a leash pop [17:39] then i'm going to recommend what i want [17:41] the dog to do and then i will assist [17:43] them [17:44] and it looks just like this i say it [17:46] like this this is how i behave so you [17:49] can see again as i talked about earlier [17:51] one of the biggest mistakes that people [17:52] make when it comes to [17:55] trying to instill obedience in their dog [17:57] is they get mad they get frustrated they [17:59] yell these are some of the worst things [18:01] you can do it's going to negatively [18:03] impact the relationship that you have [18:05] with your dog it's going to create fear [18:07] it's going to create anxiety and i'm [18:10] sure all kinds of other issues that you [18:12] don't want to have simply because you [18:15] got frustrated at your dog so this is [18:16] how i would do it if i was correcting [18:18] the dog for jumping up i would be [18:20] standing right behind the dog the moment [18:22] they jump up i'd go nope [18:25] off [18:26] yeah nice puppy if they jumped again no [18:30] correction oh [18:31] good very nice [18:34] so it's not this traumatizing experience [18:37] where we're getting mad i also don't [18:39] recommend [18:40] the traditional or old school technique [18:43] of needing a dog you've probably seen [18:46] that before a dog jumps up the person [18:48] needs the dog [18:49] that could teach the dog not to do it [18:52] but it is potentially very dangerous for [18:55] the dog the dog could flop back they're [18:57] back onto the concrete they could hit [19:00] the [19:01] step or something like that let's say [19:03] the dog falls back on a stair a concrete [19:06] step that can cause a lot of damage it's [19:08] dangerous they could also hit their head [19:10] so i advise against using something like [19:13] the knee technique and in addition the [19:16] technique where we cross our arms and we [19:18] turn away and we ignore the dog [19:21] that can work if the dog has the primary [19:25] goal of seeking the human's attention if [19:27] the dog's like the only thing i care [19:28] about is getting this human's attention [19:30] so the dog jumps up and the attention [19:33] goes away as a consequence and the [19:36] moment the dog goes back on the ground [19:37] we turn and we re-engage [19:39] so if the dog [19:41] at the dog's goal was to get our [19:43] attention and it goes away when they [19:44] jump up and then it comes back when [19:45] they're back on the ground it would work [19:46] for that dog however if the dog enjoys [19:49] jumping if the act of jumping is fun [19:52] this would be known as a [19:54] self-reinforcing or self-rewarding [19:56] behavior then ignoring it will not work [20:00] it's like trying to get a teenager to [20:02] stop playing video games by ignoring the [20:04] teenager when they're playing video [20:06] games and then giving them twenty [20:07] dollars when they stop playing the video [20:09] game sure you're rewarding them for [20:12] stopping the game but they're gonna go [20:13] back and play later because the act of [20:15] playing is fun so we have to keep in [20:17] mind what is motivating our dogs and by [20:20] understanding this then we are able to [20:22] influence their behaviors by [20:24] implementing the correct motivating [20:25] factors to do so okay let's see what [20:28] else we have [20:31] i have a belgian malinois 12 months and [20:33] he is quite fearful is socializing him [20:35] will work or will he remain the same [20:37] permanently so dogs do go through a fear [20:40] period usually between seven to nine [20:41] months of age if you're dealing with [20:43] fear issues your best friend is going to [20:45] be counter conditioning and [20:46] desensitization [20:48] go onto my channel or just search in [20:50] youtube nate shelmer confidence building [20:52] and then watch that video i break down [20:54] what you can start doing to help build [20:56] your dog's confidence this could take a [20:58] good amount of time depending on how bad [21:01] the fear issues are whether they're [21:03] learned fear behaviors or if it's the [21:05] dog's genetics if it's if you have a dog [21:08] that is very fearful based on their [21:10] genetics it's going to take [21:12] significantly longer so you want to [21:14] really be patient okay let's see what [21:17] else we have have a four-month-old [21:19] healer that is randomly urinating on the [21:21] couch for no reason after going potty [21:22] less than 20 minutes she lays by you [21:25] then walks her spot on couch in peace [21:28] so there is a good possibility if the [21:30] dog is going to the bathroom that [21:32] quickly especially with female dogs she [21:35] could have a uti if it's not a uti if [21:38] she has full control over her bladder [21:40] and she's doing that behavior more [21:42] likely than not she just thinks it's [21:44] okay and if that's the case then [21:47] or she's four months so very young [21:50] my guess is going to be uti is going to [21:52] be [21:53] probably [21:55] where the issue is coming from but if [21:57] not [21:58] four months is still very young a lot of [22:00] dogs do not become potty trained that [22:02] early so i would just follow the potty [22:04] training process that i have outlined on [22:06] my channel if you just type nate shomer [22:07] potty training and you'll see the exact [22:09] process to teach your dog how to hold it [22:13] as well as understanding when they go [22:15] outside they need to go to the bathroom [22:17] and not just sniff around in the garden [22:19] for 30 or 40 minutes [22:21] okay might be 16 weeks now used to be [22:24] very motivated to work for his food now [22:26] this week he has been slower and less [22:28] encouraged to work for his food should i [22:30] take a break from commands and obedience [22:32] well you want to make the training fun [22:34] and if we're looking at the dog being 16 [22:37] weeks if you've done the imprinting [22:39] correctly then your puppy should enjoy [22:42] training [22:43] often if something like this randomly [22:45] happens just like with the last question [22:47] i was answering with the possible uti [22:50] there could be some sort of discomfort [22:52] that the dog is feeling some sort of [22:54] medical issue i've noticed this before [22:56] with dogs that i was training all of a [22:58] sudden their motivation shifted they [23:00] weren't interested they were a little [23:02] bit more sluggish i took them to the vet [23:05] there was something wrong we got it [23:07] treated and then they were back to [23:08] training if there is no underlining [23:10] issue then often just taking a break [23:13] especially if you've been training [23:15] so often that it could be overwhelming i [23:17] did this with one of my dogs around a [23:20] decade ago where i trained her so much i [23:24] over trained her and she started to shut [23:26] down one day she just shut down she [23:28] didn't want to train she was doing [23:30] everything possible to avoid the [23:31] training [23:32] and so what i did was i didn't train her [23:34] for a few days [23:35] when i brought her back out to train she [23:37] was way more interested engaged because [23:39] we have taken that break so that could [23:41] be something that you may need to do try [23:43] that [23:44] if it seems like she's acting sluggish [23:46] or there could be some other condition [23:48] then take her to the vet to get her [23:50] looked at [23:51] okay have a four-month-old healer that [23:53] has ran oh harry did that one okay let's [23:55] see where are we [23:59] all right uh your opinion on andy kruger [24:02] he calls you a goofball and everyone is [24:04] a dog trainer since you have no [24:06] competition accomplishments yeah i'm [24:08] very familiar with andy i know that he's [24:10] done french ring and i am a goofball so [24:12] i don't take that as an offense and yes [24:15] i do believe if you are training a dog [24:17] you're a dog trainer you may not be a [24:19] professional dog trainer but you're [24:21] definitely a dog trainer something [24:23] you're going to notice especially if you [24:25] become involved in the dog training [24:27] world that the one thing two dog [24:30] trainers can agree on is that the third [24:32] dog trainer is wrong this is a common [24:34] saying a lot of dog trainers know it i [24:37] just think it's cool anybody who's out [24:38] there trying to make a difference trying [24:40] to help people with their dogs i've [24:42] never trained directly with him so i [24:44] can't say how good of a trainer he is [24:47] but he has done some good things as [24:49] being a french ring three decoy which is [24:51] not an easy thing to do by any means [24:55] and uh if you base it just on [24:57] competition well then you're closing off [25:00] a lot of the world michael ellis is a [25:02] phenomenal dog trainer i don't think he [25:04] actively competes anymore although i [25:06] believe that he has [25:07] if we're comparing it to something else [25:10] a lot of you already know that i studied [25:12] jiu jitsu absolutely love it one of the [25:14] best coaches and instructors i've ever [25:17] worked with hands down the guy will blow [25:20] your mind he's never competed before but [25:22] he can go and tap out 20 black belts in [25:25] a row so if you base it just on [25:27] competition then you're missing out on a [25:29] lot of different things i enjoy hanging [25:31] out with my dogs [25:32] competing with them is not something i'm [25:34] really concerned about [25:36] okay [25:37] let's see what else we have [25:42] okay let's see [25:48] let's see my cockapoo constantly hovers [25:50] ground when walking eats everything with [25:52] doing scent work help this or make it [25:54] worse dogs are very situational so doing [25:57] scent detection training shouldn't have [25:59] an impact on that because it's in a [26:01] different environment however if your [26:03] dog is constantly trying to sniff while [26:06] you're walking i just prevent them from [26:08] doing it by using the leash pressure so [26:10] while we're walking the dog drops their [26:12] head i go wrong i apply the leash [26:14] pressure picking their head back up [26:16] instantly turn off the pressure and go [26:18] back into the walk the dog drops their [26:20] head again wrong and i lift it back up i [26:22] continue to do this this is the same [26:23] process i would do with any other [26:25] behavioral type of issue that i don't [26:26] like the dog before me once the dog [26:29] knows the rules if they're still [26:30] dropping down their head and i want [26:31] reliability at that point i can't [26:33] implement a correction and then usually [26:35] if the correction is adequate and fair [26:37] to the behavior that the dog is doing [26:39] and you've taught the dog correctly what [26:41] to do then you should get instant [26:43] response to the correction that we've [26:45] implemented okay [26:52] uh yeah funny how you ignore this fake [26:55] dog trainer yet no matter what if you're [26:57] in the spotlight there's gonna be haters [26:59] i get like one or two or three thumbs [27:01] down in every video so i'm sure i got [27:02] haters out there okay should a puppy [27:04] sleep in the same room as you when we [27:06] have a very young puppy so [27:08] um if you get a brand new puppy eight [27:10] weeks of age and that puppy [27:13] i i prefer to keep the puppy in the room [27:15] basically is what i'm saying because [27:16] when they're that young often they will [27:19] end up whining so if you've seen my [27:20] video on how to introduce a puppy into [27:22] the home i keep the puppy right next to [27:24] my bed so if the puppy does start to [27:26] whine or cry at night i place my fingers [27:29] into the crate letting the puppy know [27:31] hey i'm right here nothing to be worried [27:33] about nothing to stress i'm here [27:36] everything's fine if you think about it [27:37] the puppies out in the wild and they are [27:39] separated from their pack they're going [27:41] to instinctively whine hoping that the [27:44] mom and the other cubs will come back [27:46] and they'll be safe when they're that [27:48] young and they can't properly defend [27:49] themselves [27:50] they need to know that someone is there [27:53] and that's why i like to keep them in my [27:55] room right next to my bed once they're a [27:58] little bit older at least past the 16 [28:01] week but preferably usually i'll wait [28:03] till maybe five or six months of age and [28:05] then they can sleep in a different room [28:06] and you shouldn't have any issues but as [28:08] a brand new puppy yes i keep them next [28:10] to the bed and i recommend doing the [28:11] same thing [28:13] all right [28:18] uh do i have any advice on bringing home [28:19] a newborn with dogs it depends on the [28:22] dog [28:23] so if the dog is very high prey drive if [28:27] the dog has a tendency to go after small [28:29] things and i may just keep the dog away [28:31] from the newborn if it's a more relaxed [28:34] dog [28:35] big fluffy golden retriever new finland [28:38] a more mellow kind of chill dog then i'm [28:41] going to teach the dog to have [28:42] boundaries and respect the infant for me [28:45] that's going to be important i talk [28:46] about it quite often that i focus quite [28:49] a bit on [28:51] safety safety is always one of the most [28:53] important things you should focus on but [28:55] even if you have like for example [28:57] charlie super friendly super nice dog [28:59] but he's a knucklehead and he has a very [29:02] hard head if i have an infant i don't [29:04] want him cluelessly to bump into the [29:07] infant hit the infant in the head and [29:09] now we're having to deal with that so i [29:11] teach i prefer to teach dogs to respect [29:13] these boundaries and that's going to be [29:16] what i'm going to do just like [29:18] introducing a dog into a home i want to [29:19] show them what their responsibilities [29:21] are in any given situation so now with [29:24] the newborn i'm gonna say if the newborn [29:26] deer you're over there you're on your [29:28] climb bed or you're in your panel or my [29:30] dogs have a tent so you're in your tent [29:33] whatever it is i'm gonna tell them what [29:34] i want them to do in these given [29:36] situations i don't need them sniffing or [29:38] licking the baby's hands or anything [29:39] like that especially since we know [29:41] babies put everything they can possibly [29:43] grab into their mouths [29:45] okay let's see [29:48] yeah i think you've been over training [29:49] that is definitely a possibility [29:53] all right [29:55] nate had a show on animal plant yes that [29:56] was a really good time a german shepherd [30:00] dog spinning after his tail non-stop [30:02] been to the vet nothing physical how to [30:04] stop it could be something that your dog [30:06] enjoys that could be a fun game [30:09] i probably wouldn't worry about it i [30:10] would just let the dog do but if it's [30:11] getting to the point where it's just [30:13] absolutely ridiculous your dog is doing [30:15] it all the time then i would start by [30:17] using leash pressure every time the dog [30:19] starts to do the behavior and i would [30:21] use the leash pressure into the sit [30:23] command so the dog would start to spin i [30:25] would say wrong or even sit i could just [30:28] tell the dog i want them to sit i apply [30:30] the leash pressure the moment the dog [30:31] sits i turn off the pressure good dog [30:34] so that's going to be a really excellent [30:37] way to redirect the behavior to [30:39] something else that you want the dog to [30:41] do so then based on pattern recognition [30:44] the dog is going to realize every time i [30:46] do this i have to go into the sit [30:48] command or sit position if i don't want [30:50] to have to go into the sit don't chase [30:52] my tail and i would do that again enough [30:54] times to the point where i tell the dog [30:56] wrong or i tell the dog sit while they [30:57] start doing that they instantly do what [30:59] i'm asking them to do then i can [31:01] transition into a correction if i want [31:03] that reliability that i talked about [31:05] before [31:06] okay [31:08] where were we [31:12] i lost where i was [31:25] uh let's see [31:28] so i'm just seeing a bunch of stuff [31:30] about andy again so let me get past that [31:32] how many dogs have you worked [31:34] where are your titles [31:35] i've worked countless dogs i don't know [31:37] how many i haven't done any sort of [31:39] competing except for a bh [31:41] and of course all the requirements that [31:43] i had to do while going through the tom [31:45] rose school so i've had dogs pass the [31:47] akc novice open utility [31:51] shits in one two and three shifts in [31:54] tracking one and three [31:56] scent detection and this is being tested [31:58] as well [31:59] in addition to [32:02] a few other things [32:04] some basic stuff pet tricks and whatnot [32:06] okay anyways [32:10] what is your opinion on toys laying down [32:12] on the floor and dog parks [32:15] toys at dog parks i think is a bad idea [32:18] because often when dogs do get into [32:20] confrontations with one another if [32:22] they're not naturally dog aggressive [32:24] then they're gonna fight over a resource [32:27] you have one dog resource guardian [32:28] whether it's food or a toy and then you [32:30] end up getting into the dogs end up [32:32] getting into a fight so i don't like or [32:34] i don't recommend toys laying around in [32:36] a dog park inside of your own home so i [32:39] have dog toys throughout the house and [32:42] it's completely fine because my dogs [32:44] have a very high toy drive so when [32:47] you're first training a dog when you get [32:48] a brand new puppy that imprinting stage [32:50] we're trying to do everything we can to [32:52] build the dog's food drive build the [32:54] dogs toy drive get them interested in [32:56] doing whatever sort of training we want [32:58] to do once we get to that point [33:01] then if the dog has that high toy drive [33:04] let's say you've been doing that for the [33:05] first 16 weeks your dog has really nice [33:08] toy drive now you can start leaving toys [33:10] around because you developed that toy [33:12] drive but if you start to notice that [33:14] you're not able to train with the toys [33:16] anymore your dog is starting to lose [33:17] interest because they have toys [33:19] constantly laying around the house then [33:21] you might want to clean up and go back [33:22] to making your dog work for the toys a [33:25] good example like i said with my dogs [33:27] ari could literally be chewing on a kong [33:29] toy or something like that i can take it [33:31] from her and start doing obedience and [33:33] she'll work for that toy because she has [33:35] that high toy drive so again if your dog [33:37] has developed a high toy drive you've [33:39] done it during the imprinting then you [33:41] can have toys laying around it shouldn't [33:43] be an issue but if it does start to [33:45] become an issue [33:46] clean up don't have any toys out and [33:48] make the dog work for those toys again [33:51] uh let's see [33:54] i'm gonna do one more and that's it for [33:56] today's live q a i'll try to do another

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 392/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everyone welcome back to another [00:01] episode i am here today in georgia at [00:04] spirited canine with professional dog [00:06] trainer maureen cuccinella who is an [00:08] expert at teaching her dogs awesome and [00:11] unique tricks and she's going to share [00:13] those with you today so let's go ahead [00:14] and get started hey this is maureen [00:16] cuccinello spirited k9 here i have [00:18] monster um we're going to be showing you [00:20] some dog tricks today i'll see a couple [00:21] of my other dogs as well smith griffin [00:24] oh and celia so i guess three other dogs [00:26] so you'll notice that i'll be using some [00:28] freeze-dried dog treats during the [00:29] training i really like to use these [00:31] freeze dried dog treats my dogs eat a [00:33] raw diet this is freeze-dried raw food [00:36] so that way it doesn't upset their tummy [00:38] they're also very motivating for the dog [00:41] and very easy for them to quickly [00:42] swallow so that way i can get in reps [00:44] quicker okay i don't really like using [00:46] things like crunchy milk bones those [00:48] kind of things take quite a few crunches [00:50] before i can get another repetition in [00:53] also i would highly recommend utilizing [00:55] a treat pouch with those treats okay i [00:57] personally like this nice silicone treat [00:59] pouch here it's a dexa street pouch that [01:01] way i can quickly grab a reward and [01:03] deliver it to my dog okay [01:06] you'll notice in this video i use [01:07] specific words i use specific marker [01:10] words so i have the word yes yes means [01:12] hey i love what you just did a reward is [01:15] coming to you then i have free so me [01:17] personally i use my free as a release [01:20] though sometimes i'll throw a snack into [01:22] the mix so you'll know sometimes i just [01:23] release her and sometimes there's a [01:24] snack with it and then i have the word [01:26] break break is guaranteed release and [01:30] reward usually something pretty high [01:31] value like a toy [01:33] or a really high value piece of food [01:35] this way i can get more motivation and [01:37] drive off the dog in that moment all [01:39] right so the first trick we're going to [01:40] start off with is roll over i see a lot [01:43] of tutorials this online and there are a [01:45] lot of little things that i feel like [01:46] are left out in helping us understand [01:49] the best way to teach this so i'm going [01:50] to take monster here free [01:52] first of all your dog knows your dog [01:54] should know how to go into a down before [01:56] even starting this trick so i want to [01:58] get monster in a down i'm just going to [02:00] lure her right into it make it nice and [02:02] easy so [02:03] when i'm looking at her hips here [02:06] her hips will tell me and where her legs [02:08] are pointing is going to tell me the [02:09] direction that i need to be on so right [02:12] now her legs are pointing to my left so [02:14] i'm going to go on this side here if you [02:16] want to go over this way so you can get [02:17] a better shot [02:18] so the legs tell me which side i need to [02:21] be on okay so [02:23] um i'm over here monster's right in [02:26] front of me i'm going to take a snack [02:28] and i'm going to turn her head towards [02:31] her spine yes and i'm going to mark and [02:33] i'm going to reward okay so in the [02:35] beginning um [02:36] some dogs may be uncomfortable with that [02:38] so you want to reward any little effort [02:40] at first this is something it's going to [02:42] probably take a few sessions before your [02:44] dog actually rolls over so i'll reward [02:46] any effort at first yes [02:48] yes and then over time i'm going to ask [02:49] for a little bit more so i might ask for [02:51] a little bit more movement yes you see [02:53] that effort right there pay that effort [02:55] i'm going to turn her head towards her [02:57] spite and i'm going to see if we can get [02:58] her all the way over [03:00] yes good job and i was able to complete [03:03] a rule over right there not the most [03:05] realistic for most dogs to be able to do [03:07] that so quickly she's very eager um so [03:11] take some time ask for effort and work [03:14] up to the trick don't ask for the end [03:16] result in the first session so i'm going [03:18] to show you that again i'll get monster [03:20] down right i'm just going to lure it [03:21] right into it yes i'm looking at her [03:23] hips [03:24] again the same side for her so i'm going [03:27] to go right over here [03:31] she knows it really well again your dogs [03:33] are going to need a little bit more help [03:34] in the beginning she sure did it took [03:36] her about 10 sessions before she would [03:38] actually roll over so that's kind of [03:39] realistic so again taking her face [03:41] turning it towards her spine yes marking [03:43] in the beginning for that effort any [03:45] effort your dog gives you and then i'm [03:47] going to ask for a little bit more and [03:49] see if i can get a roll over yes just [03:51] like that okay but yeah the biggest [03:53] thing is in the beginning where those [03:56] legs are pointing or which leg is more [03:58] on the outside is where i want to be yes [04:01] and then over time you'll get an eager [04:03] dog that wants to roll over just like [04:05] this all right one more just cuz she [04:06] wants to [04:07] legs are pointing this direction this is [04:09] the side i'm going to be on take her [04:11] head point it towards her spine pay the [04:14] effort see if i can get a little bit [04:15] more yes mark and reward and that's how [04:19] you teach your rollover [04:22] the next trick i'm going to show you [04:23] guys is how to teach your dog to jump [04:24] over your arms so first of all you need [04:27] some kind of barrier i have this pole [04:29] right here it could be a wall whatever [04:31] works best for you so i have my dog in a [04:34] sit so your dog has to at least [04:36] understand how to sit and stay or be on [04:38] a place and stay just be in a position [04:40] and stay there so i'm going to take a [04:42] snack i'm going to put it right over [04:43] here okay so you see your dog also has [04:46] to have that impulse control to stay in [04:47] the position with a snack in front of [04:49] them then i'm going to put my arm right [04:51] here and i'm going to tell her jump [04:55] yes good job and i mark it as soon as [04:57] she jumps over all right so then sit i [05:00] wanted her to do it on the way back as [05:02] well i'm going to use my other hand so [05:04] eventually i can have her jumping over [05:05] my arms while going around in a circle [05:08] so i'm going to put it this direction [05:09] i'll put the oh i almost wrapped my [05:10] snack put my snack right there [05:12] jump [05:14] jump yes good job [05:16] super [05:17] all right i'll show that again put your [05:19] dog in a sit [05:21] there we go stay [05:23] put the piece of food right over here [05:25] jump [05:26] yes good job sit [05:29] and again right over here [05:31] jump yes [05:32] i'd even put the snack there so over [05:34] time you won't even have to put the [05:35] snack down your dog will understand okay [05:37] i see your arm i'm supposed to jump over [05:39] that arm okay but make sure your dog is [05:40] consistently jumping over your arms [05:42] before you don't put a snack over here [05:44] right [05:45] jump yes so i can mark now and then i [05:49] can pay her all right do it over here [05:51] jump yes good job and so eventually you [05:54] can start to move away from the wall so [05:56] i'm gonna go a little bit further this [05:57] time you're so eager sit so i'm gonna go [06:00] a little further this time right further [06:02] away from the wall but not super close [06:04] monster jump yes good job and i mark as [06:07] soon as she goes over there we go and [06:09] we'll do one more sit [06:12] good girl jump [06:13] yes good job very nice and then so after [06:17] your dog understands how to jump over [06:19] your arms [06:20] then you can introduce a hoop and you [06:22] can get your dog to actually jump [06:23] through like your arms in a hooped uh [06:26] form so when we're introducing the hoop [06:28] sit same thing right we go back a couple [06:31] steps whenever we introduce something [06:32] new in training where we add new [06:33] criteria [06:35] so i'm going to put the snack right over [06:36] here [06:37] and this time i'm going to make a hoop [06:39] shape and i use a different cue for this [06:40] i say hoop instead of jump [06:43] yes good job [06:45] all right we'll bring it right over here [06:47] have her sit good girl [06:50] oh gotta put my snack over here [06:53] hope [06:55] master who yes good job and you'll see [06:58] like the dog might hesitate at first [07:00] when he switched that picture so we go [07:02] from this direction that direction no [07:03] problem just be patient give him another [07:05] cue if you need to um but then again sit [07:07] as the dog progresses you won't need to [07:09] put a treat on the other side [07:12] yes you can mark and then deliver the [07:14] reward and start to move away from the [07:16] wall [07:17] oh no we made a mistake that happens [07:20] good job let's go over this way sit [07:23] yes good job [07:26] and reward whoop [07:28] yes good job and then over time you get [07:30] this really cool trick [07:32] where [07:33] we can be right over here [07:36] and i can get her to jump over either of [07:39] my arms and go through hoops jump [07:41] master jump [07:43] yes jump [07:45] yes hoop [07:46] yes [07:49] yes good job [07:51] very nice and that's how you teach a dog [07:53] to jump over your arms and through a [07:55] hoop so the next trick we're going to [07:57] work on is backing up so to teach a [08:00] backup you're going to need some kind of [08:02] target or a platform so i have this cato [08:04] board here for my platform i've taught [08:06] it with a towel before taught it with a [08:08] blanket before you can you literally use [08:10] that that's totally fine so when i'm [08:12] first teaching this free [08:14] that's a free good girl i'm going to [08:16] have my dog right over here i'm just [08:17] holding her collar because she knows [08:19] what we're going to do so she's going to [08:20] anticipate it i have the target behind [08:23] her i want to start pretty close to it [08:25] right with your new dogs at first their [08:27] bodies like she's already lifting her [08:28] life with your new dogs at first they're [08:30] going to be really weird about wanting [08:32] to back up when i first did this with [08:34] monster she did everything she could to [08:37] avoid the target she would go to the [08:39] right side to the left side your dog's [08:41] gonna do that it is okay be patient [08:44] reset when that happens okay so i'm [08:46] gonna take a piece of food [08:48] and the biggest thing that we need to [08:50] work on if you can bring the camera over [08:51] this way so you can see [08:53] is when i lure her head it needs to go [08:56] down like this almost like you're [08:57] pulling the rings back on a horse no [08:59] need to go straight downwards okay not [09:02] over to the side [09:04] of her head like this or this but it [09:06] needs to go straight downwards into her [09:08] chest like that and curl okay so [09:12] i'm gonna get her right in front of the [09:13] platform i'm gonna curl her head inwards [09:15] and i'm gonna move into her yes as soon [09:17] as she gives effort right your dogs [09:20] might not even touch the target at first [09:22] as soon as they give effort mark and pay [09:25] them okay and pay them while their feet [09:27] is on the target if you can if they [09:29] already got off not a big deal when [09:31] they're first learning it's really it's [09:33] really fine [09:34] but as time goes on you're definitely [09:35] going to want to wait until i get their [09:36] feet out of here okay so [09:38] free i'll get her back forward and then [09:40] i'll add a little bit more criteria so [09:42] i'm going to add a little more distance [09:43] back up [09:45] yes good job and you'll notice i say the [09:47] cue before i lure i'm usually big i'm [09:50] saying the q when the dog has some idea [09:52] what's going on in the beginning and as [09:54] you've probably seen with all my other [09:55] tricks i don't use much cues when i'm [09:57] first teaching something yes but anyway [10:00] i'm back up adding some a little bit [10:03] more distance yes paying when she hits [10:05] the target this time a little more [10:06] distance back up [10:08] and i'm going to pay when she hits the [10:10] target yes just like that and then over [10:12] time you don't have to have the food so [10:14] close to her you can have it in your [10:16] hand down at eye level back up and step [10:19] in yes just like that a little more [10:21] distance [10:22] back up step in [10:25] yes oh is he going to try and do a [10:26] handstand that's so funny yes [10:28] just like that and then over time master [10:31] free you get this really nice backing up [10:34] back up [10:35] where the dog will go all the way back [10:37] yes and touch the target with their back [10:39] feet okay so you'll notice when i do the [10:42] cue master free very important i'm sure [10:44] the nate stresses nate stresses this a [10:46] lot in his videos [10:47] say the q first and then the action back [10:51] up then i would step in yes if i want [10:54] the dog to get this on verbal cue oh see [10:57] dr treat there free get it [10:59] very good but yeah you can use this for [11:01] all sorts of commands this is how we [11:03] will start teaching a handstand if your [11:06] dog has the uh the genetic structure and [11:08] ability to do so but that's the backup [11:11] cue the next trick we're going to work [11:13] on is teaching your dog how to do a [11:15] handstand [11:16] so to teach this trick we have to build [11:19] on our back up so remember with our [11:21] backup monster free [11:22] your dog should be at the point where [11:24] back up they are backing up on their own [11:27] yes without so much help okay you might [11:29] have to step in and help them out with [11:31] this because as we're adding something [11:33] new your dogs might be like um i'm a [11:35] little unsure about this i'm not sure [11:37] what to do so help them okay so to teach [11:40] this object or i'm sorry to teach this [11:42] com [11:43] to teach this trick we need a platform [11:47] something that you can add more of or [11:49] make taller or [11:51] a ramp [11:53] that you can slowly increase the incline [11:55] on a couple of products i can think [11:57] about um there are the stairs that are [12:00] used for senior dogs they're often like [12:02] made of a microfiber material those can [12:04] work pretty well a wooden stable ramp to [12:07] get your dog to back up on and you can [12:09] increase it over time that's really nice [12:11] there's another training tool it's [12:13] called a climb those work pretty decent [12:15] for this you just can't get as much of [12:17] an incline so basically you want [12:18] something that you can slowly increase [12:20] the height of over time i personally [12:22] like these cato boards these are my [12:24] favorite uh training tool for teaching [12:26] tricks um not the most practical for [12:28] everybody but anything that you can add [12:31] height to or increase the height of or [12:33] incline of is going to help you out so [12:35] we first start off with the lower [12:37] platform okay so i just have one cato [12:39] board right here um if you are using a [12:41] ramp or anything is that the lowest [12:43] incline monster free i get the dog back [12:45] up to back up onto the object yes mark [12:48] and pay [12:50] when the dog's feet are on here okay [12:51] just like we do with the back up free [12:53] when your dog is really good with that [12:56] we're going to add another one or we're [12:57] going to add some height to it so i'm [12:59] going to slowly increase the height [13:00] board by board um for for those that are [13:03] using a ramp slowly increase the the [13:06] incline of that ramp okay just make sure [13:08] it's stable the object has to be stable [13:11] so it doesn't scare your dog it took me [13:13] a while to figure out certain objects i [13:15] liked for teaching this [13:16] i really like these cato boards but [13:18] figure out anything that's stable for [13:20] you you can even make something free [13:23] back up [13:25] yes all right we're gonna add another [13:26] one free [13:28] so [13:29] for your dogs you probably won't be able [13:30] to do this as quickly as i can [13:33] you're probably gonna have to do this [13:34] slowly through many sessions monster [13:36] free [13:37] back up [13:40] yes good job [13:42] free [13:48] monster [13:50] backup [13:53] yes [13:56] free [13:58] see i just slowly add board by board [14:03] back up [14:05] yes [14:06] good job [14:08] free [14:09] good girl [14:16] monster cup back up [14:20] yes [14:22] free [14:28] monster come [14:29] on you're okay [14:32] yes i'll just pay that that's a good [14:34] girl [14:37] monster free [14:39] she's like i know what's going on why do [14:40] i want to get away from this [14:44] monster [14:46] come [14:47] back up [14:54] yes [14:57] free [14:59] good girl [15:05] back up [15:08] yes [15:09] so when we get to this point where the [15:11] dog is actually doing more of a [15:13] handstand now this is where i add the [15:15] handstand cue so up until now i've just [15:19] been saying backup but now that the dog [15:21] is getting the motion they're not really [15:22] backing up anymore she's actually doing [15:25] a handstand yes i'm now going to start [15:27] naming it okay monster free [15:34] handstand [15:38] yes [15:41] free [15:42] good girl [15:48] monster [15:49] handstand [15:55] yes [15:56] good job [15:58] free [16:00] gotta reload [16:07] monster [16:10] handstand [16:14] yes [16:15] good job so when i'm at this point the [16:17] dog now knows the cue handstand they are [16:20] now confidently do it doing the [16:22] handstand they now have the muscle [16:24] memory of being able to maneuver it into [16:26] it very easily yes i'm now going to [16:28] start moving her away from this now [16:30] typically you can even do this up [16:32] against a wall i'm doing it in the [16:33] middle of a room right now just for [16:35] filming sake but when we start getting [16:37] the dog off of here [16:39] you're going to want to help support [16:41] their rear right so i'm going to lure [16:42] her head down and i'm going to move her [16:44] forward [16:45] and i'm going to say something like walk [16:47] yes just to start cueing her to move [16:50] forward with the handstand okay [16:52] and then after that repetition [16:55] we do the same thing we start here yes [16:57] you see she's already doing it on her [16:58] own i really like that [17:00] she's very confident about the behavior [17:01] this dog took some time for this i [17:04] support her back end with my right hand [17:06] and i'm going to lure her ahead [17:08] yes [17:09] good job [17:10] super now typically i do this with my [17:12] left hand but for filming sake i'm doing [17:14] it the opposite way so it's a little bit [17:15] weird for her or not monster handstand [17:22] yes getting a little tired [17:24] i'm going to help support her back end [17:26] i'm going to lure her right ahead yes [17:28] and i'm going to mark and pay as we're [17:30] moving and then eventually [17:32] you can start fading this out [17:35] by removing boards [17:37] and then you can have a nice [17:39] handstand [17:41] come on [17:42] well let's see can't stand there good [17:43] then you can have a nice walking [17:45] handstand just like that good girl now [17:48] we're still working more on distance [17:49] handstand this one's rather new for her [17:51] good girl but yes you get a nice yes [17:54] walking handstand just like that [17:57] so that's how you start teaching a [17:58] handstand [17:59] all right so now we're going to work on [18:01] back stall so a back stall is where the [18:03] dog jumps on your back and they stay on [18:05] your back until you release them this [18:07] can also be used for teaching your dog [18:10] how to jump off your back and catch a [18:11] disc all sorts of really fun things love [18:14] this command so to teach this command [18:16] you need some kind of taller surface [18:18] that's going to be about the same level [18:20] as your back when you're bent over okay [18:23] so i've used this you know i've used [18:25] picnic pen uh picnic tables before um [18:28] just a table about this size [18:31] as long as it's stable again stability [18:33] is a really big deal so that way the dog [18:34] doesn't get scared and they don't want i [18:36] mean they don't [18:37] develop a superstitious association to [18:39] the object so [18:41] basically we have to teach the dog how [18:43] to jump up that height be comfortable at [18:46] that height and dismount from that [18:48] height and when we get that part that's [18:50] where we can introduce our back okay so [18:52] i just like i said earlier i love these [18:54] candle boards these are what i use [18:55] initially [18:56] but again you can use any kind of stable [18:59] surface that's going to be about the [19:00] height of your back when you're bent [19:02] over monster fruit so i just get her [19:04] used to come on free i just get her used [19:06] to um getting up onto here [19:08] she knows the place command really well [19:09] so i'm just going to say place and then [19:11] i'm going to release her off it master [19:12] place [19:13] yes [19:14] pay while she's up here [19:16] free [19:17] and then i release her [19:19] monster place [19:20] yes pay while she's up here [19:23] free and then i release good girl [19:25] monster we're not doing handstands [19:28] place [19:29] yes [19:30] and then dismount free so when your dog [19:32] monster free good girl so when your dog [19:34] is confidently jumping up onto here and [19:37] jumping off of here we can tell they're [19:39] very confident with the height that is [19:41] where we can introduce getting her onto [19:43] your back [19:44] you are going to need a helper for this [19:46] friend family member whatever somebody [19:49] that can help guide the dog onto your [19:50] back so make sure it's somewhere that [19:52] your dog is really comfortable with okay [19:54] so i have morgan here she's my assistant [19:55] trainer [19:57] so [19:58] i'm gonna give you the food okay so the [20:00] assistant has to have the food [20:02] right and they're gonna be the one [20:03] working commanding and rewarding the dog [20:06] i'm just a table basically okay so i [20:09] will bend over [20:11] about the same height as this i [20:12] typically like to be on my knees like [20:14] this and then morgan is going to lure [20:16] her onto my back okay now in the [20:20] beginning you want to pay when your dog [20:22] puts their front feet on their back or [20:23] any foot um so you want to make sure you [20:25] communicate that to your helper [20:27] and your dog is probably going to only [20:29] be able to do their first two feet in [20:31] the beginning okay [20:32] as time goes on they'll get more [20:34] comfortable with putting their back feet [20:35] on you all right go ahead and release [20:37] her [20:39] yay [20:40] very good all right so do go ahead and [20:42] do that again start on the platforms and [20:44] then get around my back it's going to [20:46] take your dog some time to have the [20:48] confidence to just jump onto your back [20:50] so i spent a few sessions [20:53] so i spent quite a few sessions i'm just [20:55] getting her comfortable with walking [20:58] onto my back before i actually expect [20:59] her to jump onto it okay so i'll be on [21:01] my hands and knees here morgan's going [21:03] to lure her all the way on when those [21:04] back feet are on and she's nice and [21:06] stable she's going to mark and reward [21:09] excellent [21:10] very nice and go ahead and dismount [21:14] excellent okay so when the dog is really [21:18] comfortable just walking from the [21:19] platforms onto your back that is where [21:22] we can now just get the dog to go onto [21:24] your back okay at this point [21:26] at this point i'm adding a cue with it i [21:29] use the cue perch when i say perch that [21:32] means jump onto my back i love how eager [21:36] this dog is so i'm going to be [21:38] further away free [21:40] let's move these out of the way [21:42] so that way she doesn't get confused [21:46] okay [21:46] so morgan [21:48] you're going to go ahead and help brown [21:49] to my back you can go from this [21:51] direction on okay [21:53] all right didn't need to do much help [21:54] because this dog understands it [21:56] however i should have been saying purse [21:58] right before she jumped but she jumped [21:59] the gun there go ahead and free her [22:03] very good all right so i'm going to tell [22:05] her perch and you're going to lure her [22:06] on [22:07] perch [22:08] yes now your dogs probably won't jump [22:10] immediately on cue like that until they [22:12] really understand it and go ahead and [22:13] release her [22:16] excellent all right i'm going to say the [22:18] cue [22:18] perch [22:19] and then you would help her onto it if [22:21] she needed it over time you can fade the [22:23] helper out as your dog tells you you're [22:25] ready wait for the dog to anticipate it [22:27] and beat it [22:29] and [22:31] beat your helper onto your [22:33] beat the helper um [22:35] by her jumping on your back first or [22:36] your dog jumping on the back first [22:38] before you fade the helper out all right [22:40] can you really sir [22:42] excellent so by that point where the dog [22:45] is doesn't need the helper anymore [22:46] they're just jumping around to my back [22:48] or right onto your back they're very [22:50] confident with it um that is where you [22:52] can now start doing the work without the [22:55] helper i may use the uh platform to get [22:58] the dog onto [23:00] onto a place to keep them in one spot or [23:02] i might do is sit whatever command your [23:04] dog is solid at monster come [23:06] sit [23:08] that's good all right and i'm going to [23:10] perch [23:11] be on my hands and knees and now i can [23:13] actually start challenging her a little [23:15] bit by standing up some [23:17] good [23:21] yes and i can start paying her on me [23:23] right i usually like to pay up here at [23:24] my shoulder yes [23:26] good girl right for her it took her a [23:29] lot of time to become confident with [23:30] this because she doesn't have very good [23:31] depth perception because of her eyeball [23:33] so it took her some time to be really [23:35] really confident good job [23:37] right but you see i'm even slowly going [23:39] up if you have a smaller dog like her [23:41] where you can actually have them perch [23:43] on your shoulder which is super cool [23:46] but know your dog's limitations not [23:48] every dog is going to be able to jump on [23:50] your back like this and balance some [23:52] might just be able to jump on and jump [23:53] off that's fine but i understand what [23:55] kind of dog you have in their [23:56] limitations and um [23:59] don't try to fit a square peg in a round [24:01] hole yes good job [24:02] frank [24:04] and that's how you teach a backstall [24:07] so the next thing i'm going to work on [24:08] is showing you how to teach a stay now [24:12] a stay within tricks is very helpful so [24:15] that way if the dog is unsure maybe [24:17] they're going to get up maybe see them [24:18] fishing around you can remind them to [24:21] stay right there without having to [24:23] administer a correction or physical help [24:26] with our obedience commands [24:28] we typically will use an implied stay [24:30] right the dog understands that position [24:32] they're sitting they're staying in that [24:34] position the state isn't necessary the [24:36] dog gets up they obviously don't know [24:38] the position and staying there well [24:39] enough but within tricks the stay helps [24:42] us give our dog more direction [24:44] in a very easy way okay so you'll notice [24:48] we'll use quite a bit of stay so we're [24:49] teaching more advanced tricks like a sip [24:51] pretty with more duration right because [24:53] in the beginning your dog is just going [24:54] to um just go up a little bit and then [24:57] we build up on that and the stay really [24:58] helps communicate to the dog okay i'm [25:00] supposed to stay up here right and they [25:02] can help give that effort a lot easier [25:05] versus you'd be like no sit pretty no [25:07] sit pretty and trying to alter them [25:08] constantly so as more communication adds [25:11] more clarity in this context with our [25:13] standard obedience commands we typically [25:14] use an implied stay especially for [25:17] competition obedience especially for [25:19] shits and stuff where they typically [25:20] don't want to hear you say a stay but [25:22] within our tricks it's a super helpful [25:24] cue so we start off with something very [25:26] simple [25:27] so she's currently in a down position [25:28] i'm just going to have her stay while [25:30] she's doing that but first thing first [25:32] um you see that she is on a platform [25:36] right you're going to want a platform [25:37] for this this way your dog is less [25:39] likely to make a mistake because they [25:41] know exactly where they should be so [25:42] your dog should have should have some [25:44] understanding of place or platform [25:45] training in general um so from here [25:48] i'm just going to simply tell her to [25:50] stay i'll give her a hand signal i do [25:51] like to use hand signals to communicate [25:53] to the dog in certain situations where i [25:55] can't necessarily speak so i'll tell her [25:57] to stay and then i'll use a hand signal [25:59] and then i'm going to immediately [26:00] reinforce her and then i'm going to [26:02] start moving around so she's currently [26:04] down i'm going to tell her stay i'm [26:05] going to move this way yes and i'm going [26:07] to reward right for your dogs in the [26:09] beginning you might have to do very [26:10] subtle movement the goal of this is your [26:12] dog maintains their current position [26:15] they maintain their current spot [26:16] whatever they are in stay i'm going to [26:18] step over this way [26:20] yes and i'm going to mark that she's [26:21] turning her head without turning her [26:22] body that's what i'm looking for some of [26:24] your dogs may need you to be very close [26:26] to them about here and then you maybe [26:29] move a little bit right for this this is [26:30] confusing her a little bit because she's [26:31] like hey i'm beyond this but your dogs [26:33] you might have to be like right here yes [26:35] and mark really quick turn this way yes [26:37] and mark really quick but for those dogs [26:39] are a bit more advanced stay you can [26:42] start going behind them yes and you'll [26:44] notice when i said stay right there she [26:46] was going to move she kind of locked up [26:47] her body that is what i'm looking for [26:49] stay [26:52] yes so mark [26:54] and then i reward okay [26:56] stay try longer distances [26:58] moving around a bit more at longer [27:00] distances yes you see that head's moving [27:03] rest of the body's frozen right [27:06] stay move this way [27:09] yes [27:10] very nice okay then you can try [27:12] different positions with it so let's say [27:14] i want to get her in a stand stand [27:17] stay [27:18] yes you'll notice when i said stay her [27:20] body kind of locked up a little bit [27:23] stay [27:25] yes good job and if your dog moves their [27:27] feet around [27:29] but is still giving you effort like you [27:31] can tell their brain is trying to stay [27:32] but their feet are still learning it pay [27:34] that effort okay say you can ask for a [27:37] little bit more [27:38] stay good girl [27:39] oh that's okay so she's a little bit [27:41] more advanced she made a couple mistakes [27:43] they're no big deal stay [27:45] oh that's okay again [27:47] so you see how she's moving her front [27:48] feet this dog here more advanced your [27:50] dog's different they're going to need a [27:52] little bit more help with it stand [27:54] good stay [27:56] yes there we go stay [27:59] a little shift on the foot [28:02] yes good job [28:05] stay [28:07] yes good job moving your head not moving [28:09] those front feet right [28:10] free it can be a little challenging in [28:12] the beginning right because your dog's [28:13] like okay i got to lock up and i gotta [28:15] freeze right here [28:16] so yeah if you need to back up help them [28:18] a little bit when she made a mistake [28:20] there i didn't make a big deal out of it [28:22] i just [28:23] made it a little bit easier for her stay [28:26] move right behind her yes [28:28] good job no front foot movement at all [28:31] marked when i was right behind her at [28:33] the point of um [28:35] of the hardest for her whatever was the [28:36] hardest in that [28:38] moment for her which is going behind her [28:40] monster free [28:41] good job and then over time you can [28:43] start to apply it i know is that fun out [28:46] you can start to apply it to all sorts [28:48] of other behavior sits down sitting [28:50] pretty [28:51] getting the dog to freeze up if you need [28:53] a handstand or whatever but yeah that's [28:55] their beginnings of how we teach a stay [28:58] i hope you enjoyed today's episode thank [29:00] you so much for watching make sure you [29:01] hit that like button subscribe if you [29:03] haven't done so and hit that [29:04]

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 396/841,3 seconds if we [01:41] look at it as one second as a guideline [01:44] that helps us quite a bit now the next [01:46] thing that i talk about is the [01:47] difference between a primary reinforcer [01:51] and a condition reinforcer remember the [01:53] primary is what we are actually using or [01:56] giving to the dog that's going to be [01:59] part of that four quadrants of opera [02:01] conditioning your positive and negative [02:02] reinforcement positive and negative [02:04] punishment [02:06] so a condition reinforcer is the word or [02:09] sound that we use that predicts the [02:12] primary i also talk about ivan pavlov [02:16] now in the video i pronounced it as [02:18] yvonne pavlov [02:20] it's ivan pavlov and he was a [02:23] uh russian [02:25] um not i think in one of my videos i [02:28] said uh psychologist but he wasn't a [02:30] russian psychologist he was a [02:32] physiologist [02:33] that's what he was and he came up with [02:36] the whole concept of classical [02:38] conditioning now what i said in the [02:39] video was he really just renamed a word [02:42] and the word that he renamed was [02:44] predictability and the reason why i said [02:47] that was to simply [02:49] simplify the concept of marker training [02:52] because our words mean to our dogs what [02:54] they predict dogs are really good at [02:57] pattern recognition they're really good [03:00] at predictability or understanding [03:02] patterns based on what becomes [03:04] predictable and that's why the markers [03:06] are so effective if we have a sound that [03:09] always [03:10] precedes the delivery of the reward then [03:13] the dog is able to put that together [03:15] they hear the sound they know they're [03:17] going to receive a reward this actually [03:19] brings me to something that somebody [03:21] asked me the other day they said what's [03:23] the difference between your terminal [03:25] marker that you like to use the word [03:27] free in comparison to your come when [03:30] called [03:31] they look the same when you're teaching [03:33] it we say the terminal marker and again [03:35] you can use whatever words you like i [03:36] like to use the word free i say free [03:39] then i move back encouraging the dog to [03:41] come to me to get the reward teaching [03:43] them that free predicts release and [03:46] reward by showing them that with my [03:49] physical body language [03:51] after doing that enough times when we [03:52] say free the dog jumps up and they go [03:54] where is my reward now when we're [03:56] teaching come we say come then we move [03:59] back i like to do a little bowing [04:01] presentation the dog walks to me i lure [04:04] them into a sit because i like them to [04:06] be in the sit front position once they [04:08] sit i mark the behavior and give them [04:10] the reward [04:12] even if the dog came to me and i just [04:13] handed him the reward what you can do [04:15] while you're luring because like we [04:17] talked about the very beginning of this [04:19] episode is [04:21] we have approximately one second to [04:23] influence a dog's behavior so when we're [04:25] luring the dog into different positions [04:28] if i lure a dog into a sit and give the [04:30] dog the piece of food within the first [04:33] second of them sitting then we made the [04:35] connection and dogs actually learn [04:38] better and faster if we're able to get [04:41] them the primary reinforcer within one [04:44] second of them doing the behavior we're [04:46] trying to capture [04:48] same thing with if you call the dog [04:49] towards you and once the dog gets to you [04:51] you give the dog the food you're handing [04:54] them the primary so now the difference [04:56] between the two even though they look [04:57] very similar when we're teaching the [04:59] dogs these behaviors [05:01] free always predicts a reward whereas [05:04] come becomes a command and it doesn't [05:06] always predict a reward we use rewards [05:09] we use that concept of continual [05:11] reinforcement in the very beginning when [05:14] we're training a dog and we're rewarding [05:16] them for every single corrupt repetition [05:18] until it gets to the point where the dog [05:20] is doing the behavior without the help [05:23] of the physical cue i've started to call [05:26] these questions and answers when we ask [05:29] our dogs to do something or when we give [05:31] them a command we're asking them a [05:34] question we're saying do you know what [05:36] to do when i tell you the command [05:38] come the dog looks at us because they [05:40] don't know then we use the physical cue [05:43] and we guide the dog into the correct [05:45] position and then we reward them so [05:47] we're providing them with the answer [05:49] after we have asked them the question [05:52] and we do that as many times as it takes [05:54] to get the dog to do the behavior when [05:57] we ask them the question or present the [05:59] command without the additional help of [06:02] the physical cue because now they know [06:04] what they're supposed to do because [06:05] we've done it enough times we've given [06:07] them enough opportunities to learn what [06:09] that sound [06:11] predicts [06:12] so then [06:13] i also give a couple examples of [06:16] human examples of condition reinforcers [06:18] so i use money in a paycheck right those [06:21] are conditioned to be reinforcing [06:23] because we live in a society that [06:26] respects and honors what the dollar bill [06:28] means and what it represents [06:30] if i gave you ten thousand dollars but i [06:33] told you you can never spend it you can [06:35] never give it away it's going to go to [06:37] the grave with you well now it becomes [06:39] worthless in fact it becomes a burden [06:41] because you have to carry it around and [06:43] transport it with you so [06:44] it's valuable because of what it [06:46] predicts then [06:48] as i said we talked about ivan pavlov [06:51] and how he renamed the word to uh [06:53] predictability is what i said and that [06:55] was more as a way of helping you [06:58] understand in the most simplified manner [07:01] what this concept of classical [07:03] conditioning is [07:04] then we also talked about clickers in [07:07] the video [07:08] and i used the blindfold example so if [07:11] you've been studying my videos you [07:13] probably heard me talk about the [07:14] blindfold example and what that is is if [07:17] i put a blindfold on you and i took a [07:19] stick and i said i'm going to take the [07:20] stick and i'm going to swing it at your [07:22] head but before i do i'm going to say [07:24] duck so i say duck [07:26] then i swing the stick giving you just [07:28] enough time to duck but what if i did [07:30] this [07:31] duck you get hit in the head every [07:33] single time and you're not able to learn [07:36] it has to precede the physical cue to [07:39] give you enough time to respond to it so [07:41] that's an analogy i've been using for a [07:43] long time to help people understand this [07:45] concept because when we're getting a dog [07:48] condition to the markers if we say the [07:50] marker at the exact same time we're [07:52] delivering the reward the dog will not [07:55] become conditioned and that's [07:56] scientifically proven it's known as [07:58] overshadowing go on your computer type [08:00] overshadowing if two things are [08:02] presented to a dog at the exact same [08:04] time whatever is more relevant to the [08:07] dog is what they're going to focus on [08:09] and they will completely ignore the [08:10] other element so dogs are more aware of [08:13] physical movements instead of verbal [08:15] sounds that we make so we have to make [08:18] sure we separate the two [08:21] and then as i mentioned [08:23] right before that was using clickers now [08:26] this is something that people often ask [08:27] me is it better to use my voice or is it [08:29] better to use a clicker [08:31] you can use both if you want you can [08:33] have a clicker when you're training and [08:35] you can also teach your dog to be [08:36] conditioned to your voice so then if you [08:39] don't have the clicker on you you are [08:40] able to fall back onto your voice and [08:42] use that as a marker the two things that [08:45] have [08:46] made clickers very successful was number [08:49] one the click always sounds the same we [08:52] have to be aware of that when we're [08:54] using our voice as a marker we have to [08:56] be a broken record yes [08:59] yes it has to sound the same a click [09:02] always sounds the same it doesn't click [09:04] a different tone or frequency [09:07] one time and then change the next time [09:09] it's always the same so it's very [09:11] distinct to the dog the next thing is [09:14] it's much easier to separate two [09:16] physicals than it is to separate a [09:18] physical and a verbal it's easier for [09:20] people to go click reward it's much [09:23] harder for people to go yes [09:25] reward something i also talk about is [09:28] make sure that you are practicing these [09:32] behaviors or these training exercises [09:35] without the dog practice without the dog [09:38] when i was a student at the tom rose [09:40] school i used to walk around the [09:42] training building and i would just act [09:44] like i had food in my hand and i would [09:46] say yes reward [09:48] yes [09:49] reward just getting myself conditioned [09:52] so then when i have the dog in front of [09:54] me i'm able to perform the way that i [09:57] want and need to in order to help the [09:59] dog learn more quickly this is something [10:01] i've been doing since i was in the [10:02] military a lot of you may know i used to [10:04] be a drill instructor [10:06] i would drive around with my windshield [10:08] wipers on and i would march to the [10:11] windshield wiper so left right low right [10:15] and that would help me practice doing my [10:17] cadences so then when i had the platoon [10:19] in front of me i was able to do it at a [10:21] level that [10:23] i would be satisfied with or at least [10:26] continue to improve my technique [10:29] marker verse praise i talk about that as [10:32] well a marker is going to be as i said [10:35] before more like a paycheck or money [10:37] it's something that you can take and go [10:39] buy something that you want where with [10:41] our dogs the marker predicts food toy [10:44] affection [10:45] i pretty much reserve my markers for [10:47] food or toys and the reason why is [10:49] because i pet my dogs all the time as [10:51] i'm sure every one of you pet your dogs [10:53] all the time so petting [10:55] usually isn't as valuable for most dogs [10:58] as the [10:59] food treats or toys are so i like to [11:02] reserve the markers for that now verbal [11:04] praise is great to keep a dog on track [11:07] to let them know they're doing a really [11:08] nice job to show them that you're [11:11] excited and you're happy that are [11:13] progressing within the training dogs are [11:15] very good at reading our emotions so [11:18] letting them know hey great job that's [11:20] awesome that's verbal praise though so [11:21] that would be equivalent to a boss [11:23] coming in and saying hey everyone you [11:25] guys are doing excellent thank you so [11:27] thank you so much for putting in all [11:29] this effort i really appreciate your [11:31] hard work [11:32] and that's great it feels good but it's [11:34] not a paycheck if that was the only [11:36] thing that your boss provided for the [11:39] work and effort that you put in and he [11:41] never gave you a paycheck or paid you [11:43] for your work then you'd probably end up [11:45] quitting very quickly [11:46] um [11:47] let's see [11:49] okay another thing that we talk about in [11:50] the video is not pausing too long after [11:53] you mark a behavior so when we mark a [11:55] behavior we want to start to move [11:58] we don't have to get the reward to the [12:00] dog but we want to start to move within [12:03] a second after we say the marker so what [12:06] i mean by that is if i say yes right [12:08] after i finish saying yes [12:11] that's when the timer starts and then we [12:13] have that one second to start moving so [12:15] if i start moving within three quarters [12:18] of a second [12:19] but the tree doesn't get the get to the [12:21] dog for three seconds we're okay [12:24] because the dog sees the movement once [12:26] the dog knows the reward is coming [12:30] then we're making that connection so we [12:32] could literally do it like this if we [12:34] wanted to we can go yes [12:38] so you can see that it came much slower [12:40] than the one second but i started to [12:42] move before one second now what we don't [12:45] want to do is we don't want to have too [12:47] long [12:48] of a [12:49] time period between when we say the [12:52] marker and when we deliver so we also [12:54] wouldn't want to do this yes [12:59] that's too long so there's that fine [13:02] line and i always try to move at about a [13:04] half second after i use a word or a [13:07] marker that's a good rule to follow [13:10] uh so another thing that we talk about [13:13] is what this is called it's known as [13:15] engagement training when we're teaching [13:17] our dog the markers it's also known as [13:20] loading the markers so we're loading [13:22] them we're getting them ready so we can [13:23] use them [13:25] and some people call this creating a [13:27] bridge it's all the same thing i like to [13:30] call it engagement training because the [13:32] more engaged we can have our dogs the [13:35] faster they're going to learn and that [13:37] also means that we want to stop the [13:40] training before our dogs start to become [13:43] bored [13:44] it's been proven that we learn and i'm [13:47] pretty sure this is going to be the same [13:48] with our dogs [13:50] better when we're at a [13:52] an emotional state that is conducive to [13:55] our learning if you're happy if you're [13:57] having a good time think about [13:59] a really amazing comedy shows that [14:02] you've watched comedy is one of the best [14:04] ways to teach somebody something if [14:06] you're laughing you're learning and [14:08] you're remembering the information ask [14:10] most people what their memories are of [14:12] school a lot of them are going to say [14:14] boring boring is the worst mindset to be [14:18] in if you're trying to learn something [14:20] new and it's the same with our dogs that [14:21] they're getting over stimulated or [14:23] they're becoming bored with the training [14:26] the learning is going to start going [14:27] down and your training is not going to [14:29] be as effective [14:31] short fun exciting sessions are going to [14:34] do you way more service than [14:37] long sessions where you're overwhelming [14:39] the dog and they're starting to shut [14:40] down and become bored so you want to [14:42] stop [14:43] when they're having a good time when [14:44] they're fun when they're invested into [14:46] the training because then they're going [14:47] to enjoy it which is very important but [14:49] they want they're going to want to come [14:51] back for more [14:58] and then also the time in which we [15:00] reward a behavior so this is why we use [15:03] the markers and it's something i talk [15:04] about near the end of the video [15:06] the reason why we use markers it's not [15:08] because our dogs can't remember things [15:10] it's not like they they forget places [15:13] that they've been [15:14] think about a place that you've taken [15:15] your dog before that your dog really [15:17] enjoys whether it's something like a dog [15:19] beach a friend's house the dog park if [15:22] you like going to dog parks not [15:23] something i recommend but [15:25] if your dog enjoys these places when you [15:28] drive to that location and your dog [15:30] starts to realize where he or she is [15:32] what happens they get excited before [15:34] they're even there because they remember [15:36] it so dogs do have memories is just if [15:39] we're trying to influence a dog's [15:40] behavior we have to let them know within [15:43] that first second you can't do a [15:45] training session five minutes later have [15:47] your dog come up to you and say hey that [15:49] sit you did earlier i really liked it [15:52] that was awesome the dog's going to just [15:54] think you're rewarding him for whatever [15:56] the dog was doing in that moment in time [15:58] the farther we get away from the [16:00] behavior the harder it is to connect [16:02] that behavior with the consequence or [16:05] the reward it's the same with people [16:09] and the example that i do for [16:11] corrections which if you haven't heard [16:12] this before it's a really good way to [16:14] understand this concept [16:17] a lot of times the dog may do something [16:19] when we're not at the house you come [16:21] home the trash has been knocked over [16:23] maybe there's a mess on the floor that [16:25] you have to clean up and you reprimand [16:27] your dog and your dog looks fearful and [16:29] worried [16:30] and people say that's a sure sign that [16:32] the dog knows that they did something [16:34] wrong and they're displaying that [16:35] through guilt [16:37] the analogy that i have for this is the [16:39] pow analogy imagine you're a prisoner of [16:41] war in a country where you don't speak [16:43] the language you're in a cell you have [16:44] the cell you have the toilet you use it [16:47] every day there's never been an issue [16:49] one day you're bored you start to carve [16:51] on the wall the guards see you carving [16:53] on the wall they run in yelling at you [16:56] hitting you and shoving your face into [16:59] the toilet [17:00] using a language that you don't [17:01] understand you don't know what they're [17:03] saying [17:04] but you know they're upset and you know [17:06] that they're punishing you physically [17:08] shoving your face into the toilet would [17:10] you think that they're shoving your face [17:12] into the toilet because you used the [17:14] toilet or because you're carving on the [17:15] wall you're gonna think it was because [17:17] you're carving on the wall because [17:18] that's what you're doing when they [17:20] started to [17:21] yell at you and to punish you in a sense [17:24] for that behavior so that's pretty much [17:27] this episode in a nutshell it's a good [17:29] introduction to markers now i'm going to [17:32] quickly go through the questions that [17:33] were submitted by the channel members [17:35] and then i'm going to take any questions [17:37] from anybody who is watching so the [17:39] first one was [17:40] my australian cattle dog turns one next [17:42] week and we cannot seem to train her to [17:45] not jump up on people could you go over [17:48] the leash pressure training or if you [17:50] have any other training methods to get [17:51] her to stop jumping on people so with [17:54] leash pressure work that does fall under [17:57] a marker if we wanted to use it as a [17:58] marker it's something that i do and i [18:00] recommend i also use leash pressure to [18:02] teach commands we can use a leash [18:05] pressure if we taught our dogs to [18:06] respond to a leash and i'm not talking [18:09] about force i'm not saying take the [18:11] leash and pull the dog and make them do [18:14] it the leash needs to become a cue it's [18:16] one additional tool that we have to [18:19] clearly communicate with our dogs and [18:21] the way this used to be taught [18:22] traditionally it was considered a mildly [18:25] stressful exercise because you turn on [18:26] the pressure and you would wait until [18:28] the dog complies the moment the dog [18:30] complies you turn off the pressure you [18:32] reward the dog so then the dog goes okay [18:34] if i want to turn this off i have to go [18:37] with the pressure instead of resisting [18:40] it and then once the dog makes that [18:42] connection they don't resist anymore and [18:44] you can teach them to follow the leash [18:46] you can use it to get them to walk [18:47] forward backwards sit down simply by [18:50] guiding them with the leash and we can [18:53] use that for commands remember our [18:55] commands are questions [18:57] the physical cue is the answer it [18:59] doesn't matter what the physical cue is [19:01] as long as the physical cue can get the [19:03] dog to do the behavior [19:04] then that becomes the answer another [19:07] good example is if your dog already [19:08] knows a verbal command and you want to [19:10] teach your dog a physical cue that [19:12] predicts the commanded behavior such as [19:14] akc obedience for the utility routine [19:17] where you have to use hand and arm [19:18] signals this is the down you go how do i [19:21] teach my dog that how do i teach my dog [19:23] that this means to lay down well if your [19:25] dog already knows the verbal command [19:28] down you can use that to teach the [19:30] behavior this is the question [19:32] then you tell your dog down your dog [19:35] lays down again it goes back to that [19:37] concept of pattern recognition the dog [19:39] learns every time my owner raises his or [19:42] her hand the next thing is the down [19:45] command and if the dog doesn't know the [19:47] down command then you raise your hand [19:48] and then you lure your dog into the down [19:50] getting them to do the behavior so [19:52] always keep that in mind when you are [19:54] asking your dog to do something you're [19:56] asking them a question and if they [19:57] haven't heard that question and have [19:59] been given the answer enough times then [20:01] we have to provide the answer for them [20:03] so going back to the question this would [20:06] be a behavioral issue and remember we [20:08] have five main behavioral issues fear [20:11] aggression destructive dangerous and [20:13] behaviors we just don't want the dog to [20:14] perform this can fall under dangerous [20:17] and the reason why is depending on who [20:19] the dog jumps up on it could be [20:21] dangerous if the dog jumps on a child [20:24] that could knock him down if the dog [20:25] jumps up on somebody who is a senior [20:28] citizen that could knock them down down [20:30] if the dog jumps up on somebody who's [20:32] pregnant that could be bad as well so [20:36] since this can be a dangerous you can go [20:38] right to correcting it now [20:40] if our dogs are practicing certain [20:42] behaviors just like somebody who is [20:45] performing in theater they rehearse [20:47] their show before they perform it in [20:49] front of a live audience [20:51] we rehearse what we expect and what we [20:54] want our dogs to do [20:56] before we expect them to perform the way [20:58] that we want in front of a live audience [21:01] and i do like to use my marker that [21:03] predicts negative reinforcement which is [21:05] going to be leash pressure and since it [21:08] predicts negative reinforcement it falls [21:10] underneath the category of a marker [21:12] again because a marker in order to be a [21:14] marker it has to predict one of the four [21:16] quadrants of opera conditioning so when [21:18] the dog jumps up on somebody they stop [21:20] petting we say wrong we apply the leash [21:22] pressure once the dog comes off all four [21:25] paws are on the ground we turn off the [21:27] pressure and the human can go back to [21:28] petting the dog so we're using positive [21:30] reinforcement that's the petting [21:32] negative punishment removing the petting [21:34] when the dog jumps up and negative [21:36] reinforcement applying the leash [21:38] pressure until the dog complies and [21:39] comes off the person they just jumped up [21:41] on so we're using three so it is very [21:43] powerful but it's not really going to [21:45] stop every dog from jumping up remember [21:47] our dogs do things based on motivation [21:50] and whatever is the most motivating [21:52] factor is going to be the determining [21:55] outcome of our dog's behavior if the dog [21:57] doesn't mind the leash pressure and it's [22:00] completely okay which dogs usually [22:02] aren't going to mind it if you taught [22:03] them correctly on what leash pressure is [22:06] then some dogs will continue to practice [22:08] this behavior the act of jumping up [22:10] could possibly be fun that would be a [22:12] self-reinforcing behavior i like to call [22:15] it a self-rewarding behavior very [22:17] similar to playing video games or [22:18] watching a movie or doing any other [22:20] activity that you enjoy just to do the [22:23] activity not to get some sort of reward [22:25] or outcome self-reinforcing behavior [22:28] if the dog's not stopping from the leash [22:30] pressure then to get reliability we turn [22:32] it into a correction when the dog jumps [22:34] up instead of saying wrong and applying [22:35] leash pressure we say no and we apply a [22:38] leash pop i'm gonna go grab a leash to [22:41] show everybody what a leash pop looks [22:43] like because this is something that is [22:45] often asked we hear leash popping if we [22:48] haven't seen it we may not know what [22:50] exactly it is so let me grab a leaf [23:04] and by the way i just moved back to [23:07] california so i am back in los angeles [23:10] i'm currently in an airbnb and then we [23:13] have another airbnb and then eventually [23:14] we'll be moving into our house so for [23:17] about next month maybe two i'm going to [23:19] be an airbnb so you might see different [23:21] locations for my filming but here's a [23:24] leash and we have a martingale collar of [23:26] course this wouldn't be properly fit if [23:29] this was a dog's neck this is just as an [23:30] example of what a leash pop is but a [23:33] leash pop is not this this is something [23:35] people do when they first do it they go [23:37] and they'll continue to pull [23:39] or [23:40] it's too light it's not it's not this [23:42] either it's not like you're trying to [23:44] crack a whip or something like that the [23:46] start point of your hand that's making [23:48] the correction and the stop point is [23:50] usually right in the same spot so it [23:52] would be this [23:53] that's a leash pop it's all it is [23:56] now if you're using a flat collar [24:00] and we go back to motivation if you've [24:02] heard my speeding ticket analogy [24:04] every dog has their own bank account [24:06] some are very rich and some are very [24:07] poor the more wealthy our dog is the [24:10] higher the correction is going to have [24:12] to be [24:13] so for example if you're driving on the [24:14] highway police officer pulls you over [24:16] writes you a 25 cent speeding ticket [24:19] and it doesn't even go on your record [24:20] let's say that's probably not going to [24:22] be enough to change your behavior you're [24:24] going to continue to speed and then if [24:26] we look at the other end of the spectrum [24:27] if the police officer pulls you over and [24:29] writes you [24:30] uh 20 000 speeding ticket you perhaps [24:33] will stop driving completely that's an [24:35] avoidance level correction it's a [24:37] correction so high you avoid the [24:39] behavior entirely but let's say you [24:41] receive a 200 speeding ticket that's [24:43] enough to get you to slow down without [24:45] getting you to avoid the behavior of [24:46] driving if you're using a flat collar [24:50] and you're doing the leash pop you can [24:51] only do a leash pop so hard we're not [24:53] trying to hurt dogs we need to correct [24:55] them if they're doing a behavior that [24:56] could be potentially dangerous and [24:58] that's why obedience is so important [25:00] it's not because we want to be tyrants [25:02] and control our dogs we want them to be [25:04] able to [25:05] know how to behave correctly within the [25:08] world of humans [25:10] know not to run out into the street no [25:12] to come when called know when to listen [25:14] and stay healed these things are [25:15] important of course for our dog's safety [25:18] if you're trying to correct your dog on [25:20] a flat collar and their behavior is not [25:21] changing and you know your timing is [25:23] correct then it could be possible that [25:25] the correction is not high enough this [25:27] can only give you so high of a speeding [25:28] ticket these max out on like 50 speeding [25:31] ticket if we're using that analogy if [25:33] your dog needs a 100 speeding ticket you [25:35] may need to increase to a different [25:36] training collar or if you don't want to [25:39] correct your dog which some people do [25:40] not and i respect that entirely if you [25:44] don't want to correct your dog then just [25:45] stay very consistent with the leash [25:47] pressure and don't allow them to [25:49] practice it it's going to take much [25:50] longer but eventually the dog will learn [25:53] that this behavior does not contribute [25:55] to the result that the dog wants and [25:57] eventually they will stop it's just [25:59] going to take a little bit longer so [26:00] sorry that was a long [26:02] answer to that question [26:04] the next one is i have a border collie [26:06] mixed breed who's amazing but she's [26:08] taken to running out of the house lately [26:09] and i can't get her to come back i've [26:11] trained her recall in a long lead with [26:13] distractions and distance even the dog [26:15] park but when she runs off she still [26:17] doesn't listen any tips [26:19] if we want our dog to be reliable off [26:22] leash the only way to have true off [26:25] leash reliability now you can have some [26:27] dogs that [26:28] 99.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 397/841,9 of the time they will stay with you [26:31] they will listen they will do everything [26:33] you need without any sort of collar at [26:35] all [26:36] but that point zero one percent of the [26:38] time when something happens and you [26:40] don't have any sort of control of your [26:41] dog whether it's a leash long line or [26:44] any other training collar like a remote [26:47] training collar your dog takes off [26:49] remember our dogs are always going to do [26:50] whatever is most motivating so in that [26:53] moment if your dog takes off and you're [26:54] trying to call your dog and your dog's [26:56] not responding because you don't have [26:58] anything valuable enough [27:00] or anything that is motivating enough to [27:02] stop the behavior of not listening and [27:04] rewarding the behavior for coming back [27:06] the dog's going to do [27:07] whatever they want they're going to take [27:09] off which of course can be dangerous as [27:11] i mentioned a moment ago running out [27:13] into the street or running towards [27:15] another dog that they think is a [27:17] friendly dog because in their world [27:19] they've only experienced other friendly [27:21] dogs but then they go running up on [27:24] somebody who's trying to [27:26] teach their dog to walk nicely on a [27:27] loose leash but the dog is highly dog [27:29] aggressive and now your dog runs up and [27:31] now that could be bad as well so safety [27:33] again we always talk about that safety [27:34] is very important [27:36] if you want true off leash reliability [27:38] the only way we can really do that is [27:40] through remote collar training i have a [27:43] chapter in my manual if you have it [27:45] chapter 8 is all about corrections when [27:47] to use corrections when not to use [27:48] corrections and i try to make it as [27:50] black and white as possible when we're [27:52] looking at something especially [27:54] through [27:56] the internet where i'm not directly with [27:59] you and helping you train your dog and [28:01] i'm not able to see everything your dog [28:03] is doing i try to make the information [28:05] as black and white as humanly possible [28:07] but there is a gray area to dog training [28:10] and that's going to be more in detail or [28:12] in line with [28:14] adjusting according to that individual [28:16] dog and that's the art of dog training [28:18] and i've talked about that before but [28:20] you have to really understand and master [28:22] the science in order to master the art [28:24] but remote color training is going to be [28:26] what's going to work best or another [28:28] option is to trick your dog if your dog [28:31] thinks that [28:32] once the front door is open she can take [28:34] off and go running out the front door [28:37] and now she's not listening she's [28:38] running away one of the things that i've [28:40] done with dogs like this is i will have [28:42] a leash on them [28:44] and i'll have a climb platform close to [28:46] the front door i'll take the dog to the [28:48] climb platform i'll ask them to climb [28:51] then i will take off the leash that they [28:53] have on and i will hook on another leash [28:56] at the same time i take off the first [28:58] one and i'll have somebody either [29:00] holding it where the dog doesn't know or [29:02] even hook to a back tie so then when i [29:05] open the front door the dog goes this is [29:07] my opportunity it works every day and [29:09] they try to take off and the leash and [29:11] collar stops them [29:13] if you're going to do that you have to [29:15] make sure it's a short leash you [29:16] wouldn't want it to be a long line [29:18] because you wouldn't want the dog to run [29:19] that long distance 20 feet full speed [29:22] get to the end and then hurt themselves [29:24] it would have to be something short on a [29:26] flat collar or even an agitation collar [29:28] or a harness to prevent them from [29:30] practicing that behavior and then when [29:31] they go to do it the harness or the [29:33] agitation collar stops them and then you [29:35] can follow through with the correction [29:38] next question is i have a german [29:40] shepherd puppy [29:41] how do i work with him on being quiet in [29:43] the crate for a few hours he lasts an [29:46] hour tops [29:47] what if he starts panicking in the crate [29:49] when i'm gone [29:50] i had a cover over it and been doing the [29:53] bowl technique but the problem is he [29:55] hears me coming since he only starts [29:57] crying once i leave the room and then [29:59] stops crying he's getting better with [30:01] that though i go back to work in a week [30:03] and i don't understand how people jump [30:05] from crate training while at home to [30:06] suddenly having to leave the puppy alone [30:09] at home in the crate does it just [30:11] transition easily or is there a step [30:13] between number one and this is why our [30:16] markers are so important and this was [30:18] something i was working with them now [30:19] the first thing is which i don't even [30:21] have this in my manual and i didn't [30:23] there's certain things i didn't put in [30:24] my manual because [30:26] either i didn't think about it at the [30:29] time because to me it's like oh we just [30:31] first you put a blanket over the crate [30:33] that's the first thing we do that [30:34] doesn't work then we can correct the dog [30:36] by hitting the top of the crate with a [30:38] metal bowl or tapping it depending on [30:40] the dog [30:41] now i had somebody who i was working [30:43] with they were having issues and this [30:44] was through zoom sessions [30:46] and the dog continued to bark even [30:49] though they're using the bowl technique [30:50] now the bolt technique if you don't know [30:52] what it is you place a bowl on top of [30:54] the crate and you walk away and if your [30:56] dog whines or barks you say no you walk [30:59] back you take the bowl and you tap the [31:01] top of the crate that will get 95 of [31:04] dogs to stop barking but this is why our [31:07] markers are so important if i'm starting [31:09] to walk away now this is what [31:12] the [31:13] person who i was working with with their [31:15] dog that was whining through the zoom [31:17] sessions they said it's not working [31:19] i've corrected the dog and my dog [31:20] continues to whine in the crate the [31:22] blanket's not working what am i doing [31:24] wrong so i had him send me a video of [31:26] what he was doing and what he was doing [31:28] was he had the dog in the crate he [31:30] started to walk away when the dog barked [31:33] he turned around he didn't say anything [31:34] the dog barked he did not say anything [31:36] he turned around he walked all the way [31:38] to the dog [31:39] then he said no and then he corrected [31:42] the dog now the reason why that wasn't [31:45] working is because [31:46] the dog saw the barking as doing what [31:49] the dog had assumed that [31:52] he wanted to take place so the dog goes [31:54] i want my owner to come back to me owner [31:57] starts walking my dog barks owner turns [31:59] around dog goes [32:01] beautiful now the dog's happy and [32:02] excited because the owner is coming back [32:05] the owner's doing exactly what the dog [32:07] wanted him to do based on that bark the [32:09] owner gets back to the crate the dog's [32:11] happy and excited looking up and the [32:14] owner says no and the dog goes uh [32:16] don't be happy and excited [32:18] i don't understand [32:20] so there's confusion and that's why we [32:22] have to use our marker at the exact [32:25] moment the dog does the behavior so when [32:27] you're walking away the moment your dog [32:29] bark nope [32:31] it has to be within a second then you [32:33] turn around [32:34] walk back and tap the top of the crate [32:36] with the bowl and that will usually work [32:38] so i always start with blankets first [32:41] next i try to use the bull technique [32:45] and then the last option if that doesn't [32:47] work for that small 4.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 398/841,9 percent or five [32:50] percent of dogs where those don't work [32:53] a score bottle works i don't like using [32:55] the squirt bottle i don't like making a [32:56] dog wet but back when i was doing stain [32:59] trains i would have up to 15 dogs [33:02] at my house that i was rotating [33:04] throughout the day training them [33:05] throughout the day and it was in a [33:07] residential area so i could not have the [33:09] dogs barking in the crate it had to be [33:11] quiet [33:12] and [33:13] that's the techniques those are the [33:14] three techniques that i would use and [33:16] they would always work and if that [33:18] doesn't work the very last option would [33:20] be a bark collar but i don't like to use [33:23] bark collars if i don't have to okay [33:26] uh [33:27] would like to confirm the difference [33:29] between yes good and free remember our [33:31] words mean to our dogs what they predict [33:34] now [33:35] yes if you're talking about the markers [33:37] that i specifically use i use yes as a [33:40] continuation marker that's the [33:41] terminology for it [33:43] all that means is the dog's going to [33:45] receive a reward that is it that's all a [33:48] continuation marker means it predicts a [33:51] reward it doesn't change the dog's [33:53] circumstances this is why it's known as [33:55] a continuation marker because if you're [33:57] doing an exercise that you want the dog [33:59] to continue more often than not this is [34:02] a stay command sometimes heal works as [34:04] well it's telling the dog you're going [34:06] to receive a reward but we're still [34:08] working on the exercise now if the dog [34:10] is not in any sort of commanded stay if [34:14] you just [34:15] let's say for example you're luring your [34:17] dog you're working on step two within [34:19] the dog training process that i have [34:20] outlined in my series and in my manual [34:22] step one is engagement training step two [34:25] is luring we teach the dogs to follow [34:26] the lure during that step we're not [34:29] saying any commands we want the dog to [34:30] focus on one thing at a time we don't [34:33] need to say the command until we know we [34:34] can get the dog to do the behavior so on [34:37] step two when i'm luring a dog into [34:38] different positions i can say yes or [34:40] free it doesn't matter [34:42] because the dog's not in a stay [34:45] to remain in a state and the dog's not [34:47] in a state to be released for the free [34:49] so either marker works [34:51] now the terminal marker predicts release [34:54] and reward so it's a guarantee for the [34:56] dog to be released and it's a guarantee [34:58] for the reward now good there's a lot of [35:01] trainers that use good as their [35:03] continuation marker so they'll say good [35:06] and reward the dog good reward the dog i [35:09] don't use good as a marker i use it [35:12] within my praise and that's why i don't [35:14] use it as a marker because i say good [35:16] all the time to my dogs good boy good [35:19] girl good nice job and since i do say [35:22] that quite often for me that's verbal [35:25] praise so always remember your words [35:27] mean to your dogs what they predict okay [35:30] next question do you have a suggestion [35:32] on training small dogs i find their size [35:35] harder to work with when you tower over [35:37] them i use your suggestion to use the [35:39] martingale collar yes and free but when [35:41] you are training a small puppy that is a [35:43] really small breed is there a better way [35:45] to get them to listen i feel like i have [35:47] to get down to my five-month-old puppy's [35:49] small height she's already a bit [35:50] skittish though i took your suggestion [35:52] on hand feeding her with kibble which [35:53] she really likes i also took your [35:55] suggestion on letting her win at tug of [35:57] war to build her confidence because she [35:59] is a bit intimidated any suggestions on [36:02] working with really small breeds [36:05] if i'm working with a puppy at first i [36:07] always like to get down to the dog's [36:09] level contrary to popular belief it's [36:11] not about dominating a dog of course we [36:14] want to be a leader we want to show our [36:15] dogs what they should and shouldn't be [36:17] doing so they're [36:18] safe and happy and successful and know [36:21] how to navigate within our world but we [36:23] don't have to get them to do things by [36:25] making them submit to us [36:28] so this is why i like to get down on the [36:29] dogs level i want to show them that i'm [36:31] working with them we're on the same team [36:33] towards a common goal [36:35] once i teach the dog the first two steps [36:38] actually the first three steps i teach [36:40] them the leash pressure then what small [36:42] breed dogs when i'm doing the basic [36:44] obedience most of the time i'll use the [36:47] leash [36:48] and i will use it as the physical cue to [36:50] get the dog to do the behavior so i'll [36:52] have the leash dangling underneath my [36:54] foot i'll say down and then i'll apply [36:57] really slow steady pressure once the dog [36:59] lays down turn off the pressure and then [37:01] whichever marker i want to use or praise [37:03] and follow through with rewarding the [37:05] dog another option which people do [37:08] trainers there's certain trainers [37:09] that'll do this mostly tom rose school [37:11] graduates will do this [37:13] it's a technique that tom rose teaches [37:14] at the school but he gets a painter's [37:17] bench [37:18] and they put a [37:20] material that will provide the dog with [37:22] traction so not the metal as the [37:25] painter's bench comes when you purchase [37:27] it but some sort of rubber or material [37:29] that provides that traction and then [37:31] they work the puppy there because now [37:33] the dogs at your height you want to make [37:35] sure the dog doesn't fall off because [37:36] that could be bad and it could cause [37:38] confidence issues but that's a good way [37:40] to work the sit down and stand your [37:42] static positions without having to bend [37:45] over but i like to work those basic [37:47] commands on the ground and when i'm [37:48] working a small dog i use the leash [37:51] quite a bit and remember it's not force [37:53] it's not leash force [37:55] it shouldn't even be called leash [37:56] pressure leash cube we're using the [37:58] leash to cue the dog to tell them what [38:00] we want and that's what has worked best [38:03] for me properly using that leash so if [38:05] you haven't seen my leash pressure [38:07] episodes i recommend watching those and [38:09] see how i use it underneath my foot i'm [38:11] not stepping on the leash and pulling [38:13] the dog down i'm using it to cue the dog [38:16] so when they feel that [38:18] they know that it's a cue to do the [38:20] behavior that we want okay uh let's see [38:22] what's next i left my 10 month old [38:23] doberman on i let my 10 month old [38:26] doberman on the couch anytime he loves [38:27] it and sleeps on it every night however [38:29] when we sit on the couch he is [38:30] overwhelming us with [38:32] painful love and head butting and walks [38:35] all over our bodies with affection is [38:37] there a way for us to coexist on the [38:38] couch and the teaching to be softer with [38:40] affection instead of just pushing them [38:41] off to the floor when it becomes too [38:43] much [38:44] if you allow your dog on the furniture [38:46] it's good to show them their place to be [38:48] on the furniture if you let them walk [38:51] around however they want that's what [38:52] they're going to do [38:53] and as long as that doesn't bother you [38:56] that's fine again it's not an issue [38:58] unless it becomes an issue it's okay to [39:00] have your dogs on the furniture if [39:01] you're okay with your dogs being on the [39:02] furniture [39:04] if i'm going to have a dog on the [39:05] furniture i like to have a designated [39:07] spot for them so they know that this is [39:09] their place and if i want to go sit next [39:12] to them or pet them or invite them to me [39:14] then i can do that and i can pet them [39:16] and have them innocent snuggling some [39:18] dogs their personalities can be a little [39:20] much it can be a little overwhelming [39:22] have you seen any of the videos where i [39:23] have charlie my lab [39:25] he is so happy to be around people that [39:28] he can't stop moving his head or body [39:30] and with him sometimes i have to tell [39:32] him like go lay down and relax you're a [39:35] little much right now ari can just lay [39:36] and not move at all [39:38] now this often will change as the dogs [39:40] get older but that's not a guarantee [39:42] either so showing them where you want [39:44] them to be and then if you want them to [39:46] move from one position of the couch to [39:47] the other teach them to get off of the [39:49] couch and then to go on the next [39:50] position and always being consistent [39:53] with what we want and what we expect [39:54] will help with that so the dog isn't so [39:57] overly excited [40:00] 14 week old german shepherd how to teach [40:02] her differences when someone approaching [40:04] from the front door to bark once and [40:06] then stop kind of let her know that she [40:08] needs to be proactive and when to stop [40:09] so okay barking having our dogs bark [40:11] inside of the house a lot of times [40:13] people want their dogs to bark if there [40:15] is the possibility of an intruder or a [40:17] threat they want the dog to alert them [40:19] this is you know one of the benefits [40:21] that humans have been receiving from [40:23] dogs for i don't know how long i mean [40:26] it's part of the reasons why they became [40:28] uh we domest i'm not gonna try i'm gonna [40:30] mess up the word right now but why [40:32] they've been become domesticated was [40:35] really because of the benefits that we [40:37] provided for them and the benefits they [40:39] provided for us and one of those was [40:40] security and giving us an early alert [40:43] one of the easiest ways to work with [40:45] this is to teach the dog a quiet command [40:47] now there's videos out there on teaching [40:49] the kauai command and often the videos [40:51] show the trainer or the handler teaching [40:53] the quiet after teaching the bark so [40:55] they teach the bark they reward the dog [40:57] for barking once adopt the dog stops [41:00] barking they say quiet [41:02] yes and then they reward the dog for [41:04] being quiet [41:05] from my experience this really doesn't [41:08] work it doesn't work that well [41:10] the fastest and most effective way to [41:12] teach the quiet command is to treat the [41:15] command quiet [41:17] as a conditioned punisher so the same [41:20] way you get a dog condition to a no [41:23] again if we're going back to the leash [41:25] pop it would be no [41:26] correction [41:28] no [41:28] correction so the dog becomes [41:30] conditioned as no being a correction [41:33] you do the same thing with the quiet [41:35] command the dog barks you go quiet [41:38] correction the dog barks quiet [41:40] correction and once a dog's quiet good [41:43] nice so you look at you go that's the [41:44] exact same thing as the conditioned [41:47] punisher it's the same thing as the no [41:49] the difference between the two is the [41:50] same as the difference between the [41:52] terminal marker free and the come one [41:54] call that we discussed earlier [41:56] the no always guarantees the correction [41:59] the quiet stops guaranteeing a [42:02] correction once the dog becomes quiet on [42:05] the command quiet so the dog barks quiet [42:08] correction the dog barks quiet [42:10] correction the dog barks quiet and then [42:11] the dog stops barking [42:13] now the dog knows that quiet means to [42:16] stop barking and now you don't have to [42:18] correct them anymore and if the dog [42:20] continues to bark after they know the [42:22] quiet command then you have two options [42:25] you can say no and correct them for not [42:27] complying to the quiet command or [42:30] you can do a technique known as three [42:33] times and a freebie and what that means [42:35] is once the dog knows the quiet command [42:37] you've gone through the process [42:39] the dog barks you tell your dog quiet [42:41] and the dog chooses not to be quiet you [42:44] go okay you ignore that one [42:46] kind of pretend it didn't happen or if [42:48] the dog continues to bark in that moment [42:50] the dog's not being quiet [42:52] you go back to three automatics so the [42:54] next three times you give your dog a [42:56] quiet command you do an automatic [42:58] correction [42:59] on the fourth one when your dog barks [43:01] you go back to freebies the dog barks [43:03] you say quiet the dog stops barking now [43:05] the dog is back on freebies and the dog [43:08] will stay on freebies until your dog [43:10] decides not to listen to the kauai [43:11] command that's one of the fastest most [43:14] effective ways of teaching the kwai [43:15] command and it's really good for inside [43:17] the house for the dog barks you could [43:19] tell i'm quiet dog's quiet great [43:22] okay [43:24] uh my now four [43:26] to five month old border collie is [43:28] starting to get a little mouthy and [43:30] semi-aggressive during training we have [43:32] been struggling with motivation recently [43:34] so i kind of used it to get him more [43:37] engaged in the training with me is this [43:38] a bad thing will it progress to [43:40] something negative do you think or [43:42] should i keep using it so what i think [43:44] you're talking about in that question is [43:46] you're allowing your dog to play mouth [43:48] at you [43:49] i don't see that as being an issue but [43:52] if you reward it then it can become an [43:55] issue now it also depends on the dog [43:57] circumstances and the types of [43:58] situations that the dog is going to be [44:00] in if i have a dog that i know is going [44:02] to be around kids if there's kids in the [44:05] household then i recommend not doing [44:07] that because you don't want the dog to [44:09] think that he can play or she can play [44:11] in the same manner with the kids as the [44:13] dog is currently playing with you if [44:15] there's no kids and you're not worried [44:16] about it it should be okay but the dogs [44:19] do see it as something enjoyable [44:21] something fun and they'll want to [44:23] practice it it's something i used to [44:24] always let ari do as a puppy she'd run [44:26] up she'd bite my arm i'd play with her [44:28] and it was part of our play and it [44:30] taught her bite restriction and it [44:32] increased the bond that we have and she [44:34] knows to stop that if i say all done [44:37] there's certain things that trigger it [44:38] if i tell her [44:40] there's a certain command that i have if [44:41] i say this command and i run away from [44:43] her she'll run at me full speed jump up [44:45] bite my arm play for a minute and then i [44:47] say all done and she walks away [44:50] instantly [44:52] sometimes a dog will offer that up as [44:54] well if they really do enjoy it so [44:56] really to answer your question it [44:58] depends on you if it starts to become a [45:00] problem then it could be a problem if [45:01] it's something that you don't want to [45:02] have to deal with in the future if you [45:04] don't want the possibility of it being a [45:06] problem or if your dog is going to be [45:08] around children or even [45:10] someone who might be a little bit older [45:12] someone who's on blood thinners or has [45:14] very thin skin that could be [45:16] a [45:18] harmful behavior so really it's going to [45:20] be situational but yes it can turn into [45:23] something bad [45:25] if you continue to practice it and your [45:27] dog thinks it's okay to do it to [45:28] somebody else who's not part of the game [45:30] that's really where the issue comes in [45:32] now dogs do become situational they [45:34] learn who it's okay to do certain things [45:36] with who they need to listen to and who [45:38] they don't have to listen to but they'll [45:40] also test their boundaries as well so if [45:42] a dog thinks that's fun that's an okay [45:44] play behavior they may think that's an [45:45] okay play behavior to do what someone [45:48] knew that they've recently met and it [45:50] could make the person uncomfortable it [45:52] could scare them and then their reaction [45:54] is going to have a negative impact on [45:55] that dog as well because now they're [45:58] seeing this fear or they're seeing these [45:59] other things being triggered from the [46:01] humans emotions [46:02] so i know that's a long explanation to [46:05] the question but something like that is [46:07] very complicated and it's more [46:08] situational if you want to be safe then [46:11] don't allow to play bite but if you have [46:15] a puppy that's just teething [46:17] and it's not part of the active play [46:20] that usually will go away at around six [46:23] months they will [46:25] once they're done teething they'll stop [46:27] mouthing if the mouthing becomes a game [46:29] then it will continue on beyond that [46:32] point so a lot of times people ask me if [46:34] it's okay to let their puppies mouth on [46:35] them i've always let puppies mouth on me [46:37] i never worried about it they mouth on [46:39] your arms your fingers whatever i've [46:40] never seen it as an issue and they [46:42] always grow out of it once they're done [46:44] teething but for dogs i've made it a [46:46] game [46:47] it continues beyond that six month [46:50] marker so those are just things that you [46:51] have to keep in mind [46:53] could it confuse our dog that i use a [46:55] clicker and my voice at uh [46:58] as a same marker yes depending on the [47:00] situation okay so is it okay to use a [47:02] clicker for a continuation marker as [47:04] well as a verbal yes for the [47:05] continuation marker will that create [47:07] confusion for the dog nope that's [47:09] perfectly okay i talked about it earlier [47:10] in this episode it's fine you could have [47:14] five words that all predict the same [47:16] reward to your dog and you could use [47:18] them interchangeably it's fine dogs can [47:20] learn [47:21] more words than what we give them credit [47:23] for so that's completely fine it's [47:25] actually something that i recommend for [47:27] people when they're using clickers [47:28] because you're not always going to have [47:29] a clicker on you so it's good to have [47:31] that verbal marker to fall back on [47:33] can a dog be trained to multiple people [47:35] meaning can both my wife and i [47:37] conditioned the dog to our own markers i [47:39] understand the importance of always [47:40] sounding the same but my yes would sound [47:43] different than my wife's yes uh yes the [47:46] dog can be trained by multiple people [47:47] it's best if everybody is using the same [47:50] sort of techniques for that dog but the [47:52] dog will be able to distinguish each [47:55] person's voice after they train with [47:57] that person long enough and that does go [47:59] to that concept of having a dog [48:01] generalized to their training if eight [48:03] or more people work with a dog and they [48:05] all use the same commands markers [48:08] training [48:09] techniques and styles then the dog is [48:11] going to learn okay i have to listen to [48:13] everybody i have to respond to everybody [48:14] and they're going to be able to notice [48:16] the difference between the human's voice [48:19] if only a couple people are training a [48:20] dog [48:22] the dog will be able to learn more [48:24] quickly [48:25] with the second person after the initial [48:27] training has been done if you're [48:28] training at the same time [48:31] make sure that you're both training [48:33] as consistent as possible with the same [48:35] sort of rules and rewards and concepts [48:39] that you're using so it's consistent [48:41] with the training but to answer a [48:42] question yes your dog will be able to [48:44] distinguish the different markers and [48:46] the voices okay so those are all the [48:48] questions that i had [48:50] from the members so now i'm gonna pull [48:53] up the live video where people are [48:54] asking questions [48:56] and i'm gonna scroll up [48:58] hi nate what's happening brian all right [49:00] tips for rescuing a one-year-old adult [49:03] adult german shepherd dog realistic [49:05] expectations given it's beyond the [49:07] socialization window so if you're [49:09] rescuing a german shepherd german [49:11] shepherd is one of those breeds that [49:15] there are a lot of different lines so [49:17] they've been it's been such a popular [49:20] breed that you're going to find working [49:22] german shepherds you're going to find [49:23] pet german shepherds you're going to [49:25] find show german shepherds and what i [49:27] mean by pet german shepherds is they [49:28] weren't trained for working or for show [49:31] they were trained to specifically be [49:33] family pets so that's going to depend [49:36] and then it's also going to depend on [49:38] the dog that you have and that dog's [49:39] past experiences [49:41] it's important if you're rescuing a dog [49:43] a lot of times the volunteers at the [49:45] shelter or if you're at a rescue they [49:47] know a lot about the dog so it's good to [49:49] ask them questions there's a video that [49:51] i did with bethany that i recommend [49:53] watching where she talks about getting a [49:56] dog from a breeder and she talks about [49:58] rescues and shelters it's a very good [50:00] video it's worth watching bethany is [50:02] awesome and i'm going to be doing some [50:03] more videos with her [50:05] soon so those will be coming up as well [50:08] but i would ask the [50:10] volunteers or the people at the rescue [50:12] what they think about the dog what [50:13] they've seen the personality traits and [50:15] characteristics and then when i evaluate [50:18] a dog at a rescue or a shelter i like to [50:21] see how interested the dog is in humans [50:24] so a little technique for that is you [50:26] can just sit down and have the dog on a [50:28] leash and just allow the dog to do [50:30] whatever the dog wants to do if the dog [50:32] is trying to be more engaged with you [50:34] the dog is interested in you the dog [50:36] wants to be pet by you that's going to [50:38] show that the dog has more interest in [50:39] people if the dog is trying to check out [50:42] what's over there and who walked [50:44] in in that direction and is that a [50:46] squirrel and did i just see a car move [50:48] then the dog is going to have less [50:50] interest [50:51] usually in people that's a common [50:53] technique that a lot of people will use [50:56] i like to see if the dog is interested [50:58] in food i like to see if the dog is [50:59] skittish or reactive [51:02] fearful these types of behaviors are [51:04] going to make it more difficult when [51:05] working with a dog now if it's in a [51:07] shelter shelters can be such extreme [51:09] environments that you will see one sort [51:12] of dog at the shelter and then two weeks [51:14] later at your house totally different [51:17] dog i've seen dogs cowering in the back [51:20] of their run at a shelter afraid of [51:23] everything and then two weeks later [51:25] completely different dog just because [51:27] the dog was no longer in that [51:29] environment [51:32] okay [51:34] thank you for your video information [51:36] okay thank you my pleasure uh tips to [51:39] get my puppy more interested in her [51:41] kipple while training outside she still [51:43] takes the treat but isn't responding to [51:46] yes every time like she does it in the [51:48] house [51:49] that's because now you're competing with [51:52] other motivating factors it's one of the [51:54] reasons why if you watch [51:57] pure positive dog trainers on youtube [52:00] when they are taking the dog out on a [52:03] walk you'll see they take very high [52:06] value rewards they're taking the highest [52:09] value reward that they can possibly find [52:12] for that dog because they want that dog [52:15] to be interested in them because now [52:18] they're competing with all these new [52:20] motivating factors within the [52:21] environment your dog looks at their [52:24] environment and tries to find things [52:26] that are of value to your dog so now [52:29] you're going out you're outside you have [52:31] the wind blowing you have squirrels you [52:33] have birds chirping you have kids on [52:35] skateboards bicycles people walking cars [52:37] honking [52:39] all these different elements in the [52:41] environment that are creating [52:42] distractions that are different [52:43] motivating factors so it's not uncommon [52:46] to take a dog out on a walk and offer [52:49] the dog the standard treat or kibble [52:51] that you've been using and for the dog [52:53] not to be interested [52:54] that's very normal there's been dogs [52:56] that i've trained where i started taking [52:57] them out on walks and i stopped using [53:00] their food or their kibble during the [53:01] walk because they weren't interested and [53:03] i was using leash pressure and petting [53:04] and praising them you can increase the [53:07] reward if you want you can start [53:09] offering your dog freeze-dried dog food [53:11] or something of higher value to try to [53:13] intrigue your dog's interest which [53:15] reminds me [53:21] don't forget we have new freeze-dried [53:23] dog food you guys get a bag you're [53:24] supporting the channel so if you order [53:26] bag i definitely appreciate it and [53:30] that dog food is if you're interested [53:32] it's i didn't make the dog food myself [53:35] it's freeze dried dog food if you're [53:38] familiar with white labeling you can [53:39] look it up see what white labeling is we [53:42] have this food made by carnivore meat [53:44] company carnivore meat company is the [53:46] same company [53:48] that owns and makes vital essentials so [53:51] essentially it's vital essentials in a [53:53] different bag so you're buying vital [53:55] essentials salmon when you're buying [53:57] ours but you're supporting the channel [53:58] so i appreciate everyone that orders you [54:00] just go to ariencharlies.

[54:08] training outside what i meant to say was [54:09] you can in you can start using a higher [54:12] value reward if you want or you can do [54:14] what i often do and i'll offer it to [54:16] them if they don't want them no problem [54:18] and i just train without it if that's [54:20] what it comes down to because i don't [54:22] want to really greatly increase [54:24] the dog's pay grade because then it's [54:26] going to lower their motivation on the [54:28] kibble but each dog is different that's [54:30] something important to keep in mind as [54:31] well so read your dog [54:33] if you have a dog like charlie it [54:35] doesn't matter if i give charlie [54:38] steak from a five-star restaurant he's [54:41] still gonna love his kibble he's still [54:42] gonna love that for training he's still [54:44] gonna love the freeze-dried dog food [54:45] there's other dogs you give him a piece [54:47] of steak and they don't ever want to [54:48] touch their kibble again [54:50] all right [54:51] i am becoming a dog trainer and when i [54:53] found your videos i've learned a lot [54:54] from you thanks a lot it's my pleasure [54:56] i'm happy to be able to help [54:58] and that's something that's important [55:00] and it's something so if if you're [55:02] working on becoming a dog trainer and [55:04] you're studying a bunch of different dog [55:05] trainers you are on the right track one [55:08] thing that i personally cannot stand [55:10] about any industry [55:12] is when somebody in that industry has [55:15] contempt for somebody else within the [55:17] industry the minute you close your mind [55:20] off to learning is the minute that you [55:22] start to [55:24] slow down your progress and basically [55:26] stall in one position [55:28] just like [55:29] seneca said if you study stoic [55:31] philosophy i study other philosophers [55:34] like a spy and enemies camp we can [55:36] always learn from other people so being [55:39] open-minded remember our brains are a [55:41] lot like a parachute it only works when [55:42] it's open so i think it's great that [55:44] you're studying as many different dog [55:46] trainers as possible and i'm very happy [55:48] that my videos have been helpful [55:50] how would you click mark and train the [55:52] quiet command or not to bark so i think [55:55] that question probably came through [55:56] before i talked about the bark so use it [55:59] as a condition correction once a dog [56:00] learns that barking means to be quiet [56:02] then it's now a command [56:04] uh best teacher on the planet i don't [56:07] know about that but i really appreciate [56:08] that kevin [56:10] is there a way to use a clicker to get [56:12] my puppy to stop biting me [56:14] now [56:16] if you're using the clicker as a [56:18] condition punisher then yes you can use [56:22] a clicker to teach the dog to stop [56:23] biting you the click means a correction [56:26] if your dog enjoys biting you and then [56:28] you want to click your dog's behavior [56:30] when your [56:31] dog or your puppy stops biting you so [56:33] your puppy's biting you and your puppy [56:35] stops and you click [56:36] well you're rewarding your puppy for [56:39] stopping the behavior of biting your [56:41] hand but it wouldn't stop the biting of [56:44] your hand because biting your hand is [56:46] going to be as we talked about before a [56:48] self-reinforcing behavior the behavior [56:50] itself is fun and so the dog is going to [56:52] continue to do it if we click when the [56:54] dog stops doing it and we reward them [56:57] that would be the same as trying to get [56:59] a teenager to stop playing video games [57:01] by giving the teenager five dollars once [57:04] he stops playing it doesn't mean he's [57:06] not gonna go back and play the game [57:07] again later because playing the game is [57:09] fun so you have [57:10] excuse me you have two main options stop [57:13] the behavior once it starts using leash [57:16] pressure negative reinforcement not [57:18] allowing the puppy to do it removing [57:20] them from that area or correcting them [57:22] from doing them so those are going to be [57:24] the two ways to stop it it's fine to [57:27] redirect the puppy to something else [57:28] especially during that time they're [57:30] teething if your puppy goes to bite you [57:32] and you give your puppy a tug toy or [57:34] something else to teeth on [57:36] that's fine you're redirecting you're [57:38] giving your puppy another option now it [57:40] doesn't teach them not to bite your hand [57:42] because your puppy sees it as [57:44] this is something fun to bite that is [57:46] something fun to bite so then if the [57:48] second item's not there your puppy will [57:50] go back to biting your hand because that [57:52] was fun so again you either stop them [57:54] you prevent them give them a different [57:56] option or you correct them i like to if [57:58] i don't want them to mouth me i've [58:00] talked about this before i let puppy's [58:02] mouth it usually goes away at six months [58:05] but if i don't want them to if they have [58:06] really sharp teeth then i like to [58:08] redirect them give them something else [58:11] to do that too and not my hand so that's [58:13] a good option [58:17] it's my pleasure kevin [58:20] click that like thanks i appreciate that [58:22] is there any tips on training larger [58:24] dogs like german chef shepard husky [58:26] golden retriever doberman okay training [58:28] larger dogs training smaller dogs it [58:31] doesn't matter what kind of dog i'm [58:33] training i always [58:34] do the same process it works on every [58:37] dog that's why i've developed the [58:39] step-by-step process now the [58:42] step-by-step process like engagement [58:44] training engagement training is not [58:46] going to work on a dog if that dog is [58:48] not interested in the food if i bring a [58:50] dog out and i only have one type of [58:52] kibble and that dog is not interested in [58:55] that kibble [58:56] well [58:57] i can't do the engagement training i [58:58] don't have any other options so we have [59:00] to make sure for engagement training [59:02] this goes back to that art of dog [59:03] training i have to make sure the dog [59:05] wants what i have reward-based training [59:08] is limited by how much the dog wants the [59:10] reward which that does bring me to [59:13] something else that [59:14] this was asked through an email person [59:16] was trying to find somebody local as a [59:18] dog trainer and they were asking is it [59:20] okay [59:21] to hire a pure positive dog trainer [59:24] and a lot of times you might hear a [59:27] balanced dog trainer or a traditional [59:30] style dog trainer will say no you're [59:32] wasting your money by hiring a pure [59:34] positive dog trainer i disagree with [59:37] that and here's why i disagree [59:40] if you what what is it we're trying to [59:42] do well we're trying to train our dogs [59:44] we're trying to teach them behaviors if [59:46] you hire a pure positive dog trainer to [59:48] do a board and train let's say [59:50] and [59:51] that dog is interested in food and [59:54] interested in toys so that pure positive [59:57] trainer can use these to train the dog [59:59] that trainer if the trainer is good [60:02] he or she is going to be able to teach a [60:03] sit a down a calm all these different [60:06] commands are going to be able to teach [60:07] the dog the commands but they're not [60:09] going to be completely reliable and you [60:12] may say well that's a problem i want my [60:14] training to be reliable [60:16] you can have them teach the behaviors [60:17] and then you as the owner can reinforce [60:20] it [60:21] so the hardest part is not correcting a [60:23] dog that's the easiest part of training [60:26] the hard part is teaching the dogs what [60:28] to do and to do it consistently when we [60:30] give them the commands and get them to [60:32] understand to work for rewards to work [60:35] to turn off pressure and then once the [60:37] dog knows it so when i'm teaching a dog [60:39] through obedience [60:41] i don't correct them until the dog knows [60:43] everything and if you've done the [60:44] training correctly in the beginning if [60:46] you've given the dog enough time to [60:48] learn if you've done enough repetitions [60:51] and the dog's confident and capable when [60:53] you start adding corrections you should [60:55] not have to correct the dog very much [60:57] because once you start adding [60:58] corrections that dog should go oh okay i [61:00] know what you want i'm not going to make [61:02] that mistake again and that's really a [61:05] clear indicator for most dogs of course [61:07] every dog is going to be different but [61:09] that's a clear indicator for most dogs [61:11] that you've done the training correctly [61:13] when you start adding corrections based [61:15] on how much you have to correct the dog [61:17] if you have to correct the dog a lot [61:19] then the dog either doesn't know what [61:22] you're asking them to do or [61:24] the correction is not adequate to that [61:26] dog's bank account that goes back to [61:28] that 25 cent speeding ticket but if you [61:30] if the correction is adequate if the [61:32] timing's correct and the dog knows what [61:34] they're supposed to do and how to turn [61:35] off pressure by complying corrections go [61:37] fast you don't have to correct your dog [61:39] that much so if you are out there and [61:41] you're thinking i'm going to hire a [61:42] trainer but there's only pure positive [61:45] if that pure positive trainer is good [61:47] that will at least teach the dog the [61:49] behaviors then you can reinforce it of [61:51] course my preferred is balance i think [61:53] bounce trainers are the way to go but [61:55] there's nothing wrong with a pure [61:57] positive trainer if you don't mind [61:59] reinforcing the rules and expectations [62:01] when you get your dog back [62:03] so going back to answer that question [62:06] really each dog is going to be based on [62:08] the dog and not necessarily the size so [62:10] if i have food that the dog likes [62:13] excellent i can start training the dog [62:14] now something that i've done [62:16] so if any of you are either becoming a [62:18] dog trainer interested in being a [62:20] professional dog trainer or perhaps [62:23] doing it as a hobby you're retiring and [62:25] you want to help people train their dogs [62:28] when i would do stain training this is [62:29] something that i did because i always [62:31] believe in quality i try to deliver the [62:33] best quality possible so when i would do [62:36] it a stay in train i have what i would [62:38] call an adjustment period during the [62:40] adjustment period i'd never charge the [62:43] client for it and the adjustment period [62:45] was for the dog to get comfortable in [62:47] the new environment i wouldn't take a [62:50] dog that is uncomfortable in this new [62:52] environment is a little worried isn't it [62:54] this brand new place their owners are [62:56] not there and the dog's stressed out i [62:58] don't take that dog and start working [63:00] with them right away the first thing [63:02] that i do is i build a relationship with [63:05] the dog i bond with the dog i get the [63:07] dog comfortable i've had a dog take two [63:09] weeks before to get comfortable in my [63:11] house and then after those two weeks [63:14] that's when i started the actual [63:16] training and the reason why i wouldn't [63:18] charge owners for that is because i [63:20] wouldn't want them to think i'm taking [63:21] advantage of them i wouldn't want them [63:23] to think like two you did two weeks of [63:26] this transitioning period or adjustment [63:28] period you're ripping me off i didn't [63:30] want them to think that i want them to [63:31] know that [63:32] it's for the dog and the reason why we [63:35] do that the reason why we don't train [63:37] the dog right away is because if we [63:39] train a dog when they are stressed out [63:41] when they're anxious when they're [63:42] nervous uncomfortable then that's going [63:45] to be the feeling that the dog [63:46] associates with the training and if our [63:49] dog associates those feelings with the [63:51] training the dog's not going to enjoy [63:53] the training they're not going to learn [63:55] as fast and it's going to take you [63:57] significantly longer and the results [63:59] will never be as good [64:00] so i would have that adjustment period [64:02] once the dog is comfortable then i start [64:04] doing that engagement training if i'm [64:06] if i start doing engagement training the [64:08] dog's not interested and this is [64:10] something i would it would be dependent [64:12] on what the owners would want either we [64:14] increased the value of the dog's food so [64:17] if i was using kibble and the dog isn't [64:18] interested in taking the kibble then [64:20] okay we can try freeze-dried dog food or [64:22] something else that the dog wants or and [64:25] i received a negative review on my book [64:26] for this or we use food deprivation [64:29] meaning not you [64:31] starve the dog [64:33] that's not it at all you bring the dog [64:35] out you offer the dog the food you go [64:37] here's the food are you ready to train [64:39] and the dog goes nope i'm not interested [64:41] in training i don't want to work for [64:42] that food and you go okay no problem [64:44] buddy we'll try again at dinner dinner [64:46] rolls around and you don't give the dog [64:48] any food between that dinner rolls [64:50] around you go you ready do you want to [64:51] take this food the dog goes nah i'm [64:53] still not interested and i go great [64:55] we'll try again at breakfast breakfast [64:57] rolls around i go hey you want this food [64:59] the dog goes yeah that looks really good [65:01] now [65:01] now i have the dog working for the food [65:04] because if i wasn't willing to either [65:06] increase the value of the food to get [65:07] them to work for it or if i wasn't [65:09] willing to [65:10] do that food deprivation for a day or [65:13] two depending on the dog then my only [65:16] other option is force that's it i forced [65:19] the dog to do it now force sounds bad [65:22] it's not bad leash pressure would be an [65:24] example of force once the dog [65:26] understands it i can train a dog using [65:28] leash pressure without ever giving the [65:30] dog any food and only rewarding them [65:32] with petting i like to use food though [65:35] because from my experience it increases [65:37] the motivation the dog ends up enjoying [65:40] the training more and we see better [65:41] results and remember once the dog knows [65:44] the commanded behavior they're [65:46] responding on the verbal command then we [65:48] have to start spacing out the food so [65:50] even though in the beginning and if you [65:52] watch all my training videos what am i [65:53] doing i'm giving the dog all kinds of [65:55] food during the training that's because [65:57] it's a new exercise and we're doing [65:59] continual reinforcement but once your [66:01] dog knows it and i have a video [66:03] specifically on that it's a six minute [66:04] short video [66:06] i think i posted it like three months [66:07] ago [66:08] we start removing it's a three stage [66:10] process stage one continual [66:12] reinforcement stage two either you [66:14] reward or you provide verbal praise [66:16] stage three reward verbal praise or you [66:19] say nothing at all and you slowly start [66:21] to remove the verbal praise or the food [66:24] and then eventually you're rewarding [66:26] maybe [66:27] one time for every 12 13 14 [66:31] ten repetitions or commanded behaviors [66:34] rather so i might say sit down come heel [66:36] down sit free and then i reward my dog [66:39] but i always provide rewards i never ask [66:42] a dog to work indefinitely without some [66:45] kind of reward even the ones that didn't [66:47] want the food a pedal they're still [66:49] getting something okay what's next [66:52] how do you stop a puppy from fighting we [66:54] talked about that a little bit you [66:56] redirect or you correct or you prevent [66:59] my eight-month-old cocker [67:01] pees when meeting strangers appears to [67:03] be excitement not fear okay so if you [67:06] have a dog that happy peas excited peas [67:10] there's not much you could do [67:12] i i know that's not the answer you were [67:14] hoping for but when we have a dog that [67:17] pees when they're excited and happy most [67:19] dogs do end up growing out of it but [67:21] it's not a guarantee i had a friend who [67:23] had a dog that would pee [67:25] anytime that dog met someone new because [67:27] you can't you can't correct the dog for [67:29] that it's an involuntary behavior [67:31] so all he would do is anytime someone [67:33] was saying hi to his dog if somebody [67:35] came over to his house he would take the [67:37] dog outside [67:39] allow the dog to say hi the dog would [67:41] happy pee once the dog got that out of [67:43] his system then they would go inside so [67:45] most dogs will grow out of it if your [67:47] dog does not grow out of it [67:50] take the dog outside to say hi to people [67:52] and then bring the dog back in i wish i [67:53] had a better answer for that one if [67:55] somebody has [67:56] a better suggestion please let me know [67:58] but i haven't been able to find one [67:59] because again you can't [68:01] we can't correct it [68:02] okay [68:04] um [68:05] also how would you i'm in puppy biting [68:08] hell that's funny [68:10] uh also how would you train not barking [68:13] at windshield wipers [68:15] that's going to be [68:16] probably something i would correct [68:19] dog barks i would use the quiet command [68:21] quiet correction once the dog knows not [68:24] to bark at it anymore you can also use [68:26] that concept don't forget the concept of [68:28] counter conditioning and desensitization [68:30] we expose it at a distance or at a [68:32] stimuli low enough not to create any [68:34] sort of negative response from the dog [68:37] associate it with something positive and [68:39] gradually increase the stimuli so if the [68:41] dog is afraid of the windshield wipers [68:42] then you definitely don't want to [68:44] correct because then that's going to [68:46] make the behavior worse [68:48] the dog expects it to be bad you show [68:50] the dog that it's bad by correcting them [68:52] but if the dog is just barking at it [68:53] just to be obnoxious then you could use [68:55] the quiet command but that's really [68:56] going to come down to knowing that dog [68:58] but when in doubt use counter [69:01] conditioning and desensitization i have [69:02] an entire episode on that i would [69:04] definitely recommend checking out [69:06] um let's see [69:09] the reward timing yes [69:11] reward was one of the hardest things for [69:12] me to get right yeah that same hey jim [69:14] that's the same for everybody [69:17] it's something the the two hardest [69:19] things that [69:20] i see people that are trying to either [69:22] become dog trainers or train their own [69:24] dogs is one [69:25] pairing [69:27] it's so hard not to pair because our [69:30] mind and our bodies want to go the same [69:31] time there's been plenty even recently [69:34] where i film a training video and then [69:36] when i'm editing the video i noticed two [69:38] of the markers i paired i was like yes [69:41] it's gonna happen as long as you're [69:42] aware of it though and you try not to do [69:44] it and [69:45] 70 80 90 of the time you're you're doing [69:48] it correctly you're good now remember [69:49] that once your dog is conditioned to the [69:51] sound if you pair it it's probably not [69:54] going to have a negative impact because [69:55] the dog's condition to the sound it's [69:58] most important when we're conditioning [70:00] them to the sound once they're [70:01] conditioned great now we have plenty of [70:03] time to get the dog the reward and if [70:05] they hear the sound even if you are [70:07] moving when you make the sound hopefully [70:10] the dog hears it now the problem with [70:12] that though if you are if you do end up [70:13] getting lazy and you start pairing it a [70:15] lot then the dog could ignore the marker [70:18] sound and now they're just looking for [70:19] your body language to move and now [70:21] that's the signal for your dog to jump [70:23] up a good way to test that out is put [70:26] your dog in a sit don't say your [70:28] terminal marker and just move [70:30] as if you were staying your terminal [70:32] marker and if your dog breaks the [70:33] position reinforce it so they know that [70:36] it's not the movement but the sound we [70:38] teach them with the movement when we're [70:40] first teaching it but once the dog's [70:42] conditioned you should be able to move [70:44] however you want if your dog's in a stay [70:45] and the dog should not be able to just [70:46] jump up [70:49] let's see can you please say how to stop [70:51] my dog from growling when he is eating [70:53] food and gets very possessive with his [70:54] food there's a video that [70:59] there's a video that there's another [71:00] video that i did with bethany [71:03] i can post it in the comments let me see [71:05] if i can [71:06] find it but it's dealing with dogs that [71:10] have issues resource guarding and i [71:12] think one of the things that she even [71:14] mentions is [71:15] alpha [71:16] we often use that word alpha when we're [71:19] discussing dogs and dog training which [71:21] dogs the alpha which one's the beta the [71:23] which one's [71:24] submissive [71:26] alpha in the dog world is lit it's it's [71:30] um [71:32] priority access to limited resources so [71:35] if there's a group of dogs and there's [71:37] one dog that has priority access to a [71:39] limited resource that would be by [71:41] definition the alpha so she talks about [71:44] in the video [71:48] and i'm gonna just put this in the chat [71:50] but as i said it's a great video to [71:52] watch long story short the technique [71:55] that i recommend that she demonstrates [71:58] in the video when your dog is eating [72:00] why do dogs start to growl why do they [72:02] become aggressive why do they resource [72:05] guard well because they're afraid of the [72:07] resource being taken away [72:09] and if our hand comes towards them and [72:11] they think we're going to take it away [72:13] because we're trying to be the alpha [72:15] and the dog doesn't want that well they [72:17] may act aggressively they may growl at [72:20] first but then if growling doesn't work [72:22] then they [72:24] escalation of force they decide to bite [72:27] or act like they're going to bite so [72:29] what we want to do the way that i like [72:31] to do it is i'll give the dog [72:34] a bowl of food whatever and then i will [72:36] present something of slightly higher [72:39] value i think in the video she used just [72:41] more kibble and she was using it with a [72:43] puppy which is great great exercise to [72:45] do with puppies with the dog that might [72:47] be older [72:48] i might use a slightly higher value [72:50] reward so let's say the dogs eat their [72:52] kibble i might have a handful of [72:53] freeze-dried dog food and i'm gonna [72:55] slowly move it to the dog slow enough to [72:58] where they see my hand coming and they [73:01] see the food and they smell the food and [73:03] they realize i'm adding value i'm not [73:05] taking away then i give the dog that [73:08] food so now i'm showing my dog when i [73:10] bring my hand to you that doesn't mean [73:13] that i'm going to take away what you [73:15] have but rather i'm going to add value [73:17] to what you have and now we have a dog [73:20] that sees the hand coming and goes [73:22] awesome you're going to give me more [73:23] food you're going to give me value this [73:24] could take a lot of repetition but it's [73:27] definitely an exercise worth doing i [73:30] still want to share that video if i can [73:32] find it it's crazy how many videos i [73:35] have now on this channel [73:39] you know what i think i'm just going to [73:40] post it later [73:42] because i can't find it right now oh [73:44] here we go how to stop puppy resource [73:46] guarding perfect [73:49] okay so i'm gonna [73:50] copy and paste this [73:53] there we go okay cool what's next [73:57] for puppy biting i jerk back and yell [73:59] ouch it seems to have worked that can [74:02] work so that that goes back to always [74:05] remember the science of dog training [74:07] if you do a behavior so and this is why [74:10] not every technique works on every dog [74:13] you're very [74:14] i actually i don't know if there's any [74:16] technique [74:17] that guarantees to work on every dog now [74:19] there's a process that works on every [74:21] dog but not techniques that work on [74:23] every dog so a good example is dogs that [74:26] jump up a common technique is to cross [74:29] your arms [74:30] turn and ignore the dog this works on a [74:33] lot of dogs this will work on a dog the [74:35] dog's only goal [74:37] the only reason why they're jumping up [74:39] is to get your attention [74:41] and as an effect of them jumping up you [74:43] ignore them [74:45] now you're delivering the exact opposite [74:47] of what they want and then they go well [74:49] this sucks and they put their paws on [74:51] the ground and then you turn around you [74:52] go yay good job [74:54] that's going to work on that dog because [74:55] that dog wants your attention and the [74:57] dog goes oh excellent if i don't jump up [75:00] if i keep my paws on the ground you're [75:02] going to give me what i want really cool [75:04] or if i sit you make them sit and then [75:06] you pedal [75:07] but if the dog enjoys jumping up then [75:09] ignoring that dog is not going to work [75:12] because the dog jumps up and you ignore [75:14] him the dog's like i don't care if [75:15] you're ignoring me jumping up is fun [75:18] there's some puppies that will go to [75:20] bite your hand [75:21] and you can go ouch and pull away and [75:23] that puppy's gonna go oh [75:24] i don't i didn't like that i didn't like [75:26] that at all [75:27] and then the puppy stops and you praise [75:29] and pet him the puppy goes okay i don't [75:31] wanna i don't wanna bite you i didn't [75:32] like that reaction [75:34] but there's some puppies and i'm sure [75:36] a good amount of you on here has seen [75:38] this before the puppy goes to bite you [75:40] say ouch and react and the puppy bites [75:42] you even more the puppy goes that was [75:44] fun i like that reaction and they bite [75:46] you more so it is good to try these [75:48] techniques see if it works on your dog [75:50] if it doesn't work then you have to [75:52] adjust and use a different technique [75:54] that might work so not every technique [75:56] works on every dog and not every dog is [75:59] going to respond every technique [76:01] all right [76:02] i had a dog before that always got sick [76:04] in the car never grew out of it i spent [76:06] hours hand feeding the car playing in [76:08] the car short journeys but the dog was [76:10] sick all the time no matter what that [76:12] can't happen [76:13] that's more rare a lot of times dogs [76:16] will [76:16] get used to car rides if you do exactly [76:18] what you said you do short drives [76:21] what i would do is i'd get the dog [76:22] comfortable going in and out of the car [76:24] and then when the dog was in the car i [76:26] might back up out of the driveway pull [76:28] back in and then let the dog out and [76:31] most of the time that will work but [76:32] that's possible i mean there are times [76:34] where you may do everything correctly [76:36] and it doesn't fix an issue like the dog [76:40] getting sick in the vehicle or [76:42] the dog [76:43] peeing when they're excited when [76:45] somebody new walks in so [76:48] there may be certain things that you can [76:51] do that might help with that if the [76:54] training or the different processes [76:56] don't work for example um if you talk to [76:59] a veterinarian i don't like using this [77:01] as an option when i'm working with a dog [77:03] but [77:04] if it's the last choice that you have [77:06] then some i think they do have [77:08] medication that you can give a dog that [77:09] will help with that [77:12] all right [77:13] puppy biting i take away the fun so if [77:15] the puppy bites me i just stand up and [77:17] leave the puppy as worked on all my dogs [77:18] yep that could definitely work [77:23] uh military death by powerpoint is that [77:26] what you're saying nco school maybe i [77:28] think you're talking about [77:30] when [77:31] boring when something's boring you're [77:33] not gonna learn as well uh yeah but what [77:35] if the dog is biting me while i'm [77:36] walking and you could set that up and [77:38] correct i tried yelling ouch and that [77:40] doesn't work so a lot of these are the [77:42] puppy ones and that's what we talked [77:43] about make sure you adjust and try the [77:45] different techniques that's going to [77:46] work with your dog [77:47] uh i just want to say thank you it's my [77:50] pleasure arm and hammer uh your teaching [77:52] has helped me with my dog so much [77:54] balance training is the best i i think [77:56] balance training is great is i it's my [77:58] preferred training style but as i [78:00] mentioned earlier if you were to hire a [78:02] pure positive dog trainer if they are a [78:03] good dog trainer it could help you teach [78:05] your dog the behaviors and then you [78:07] could reinforce it [78:11] yep you can trade okay i'm gonna answer [78:13] one more question because we're uh this [78:16] is almost coming up to an hour and 20 [78:18] minutes already [78:19] uh we're gonna get our puppy chow chow [78:21] this weekend [78:23] ciao ciaos are cute they make cute [78:24] puppies binge watch your series for the [78:26] past month and took notes to get ready [78:28] oh that's awesome cool let me know how [78:30] it goes i i hope the training goes [78:31] really well chow chows are [78:34] really they're cute puppies they have a [78:36] bad reputation because they do tend to [78:38] get into dog fights but it's not really [78:42] from and this is what i've read [78:44] uh [78:45] it's that they're dog aggressive because [78:47] i've only worked not that many people [78:48] have chow chows i've only worked with a [78:50] handful of chow chows [78:52] but they have a posture that makes them [78:54] look aggressive to other dogs so often [78:57] chow chows are attacked by other dogs [79:00] and because of that they've gotten this [79:03] reputation that their dog aggressive [79:05] that's not what i saw from the dogs that [79:07] i trained the chow chows i had they were [79:08] great no issues they were very friendly [79:11] no dog aggression issues but they are a [79:13] little bit more independent than some of [79:15] the other dog breeds same as like our [79:17] huskies tend to be a little bit more [79:18] independent but [79:20] chow chows are cute you're gonna have [79:21] fun okay uh that wasn't a question so we [79:23] got one more [79:25] uh kong fillers are they used on top of [79:28] three meals for your puppy or do i have [79:30] to make them part of their meals [79:32] it depends on the kong filler so what i [79:34] like to use if i'm filling a kong is raw [79:38] dog food [79:39] i like using raw dog food another one is [79:41] i would use the kibble i have a video of [79:43] that and then fill it with water so it [79:45] expands stuff that into the kong and [79:47] freeze it that's great i would have [79:49] count that into the dog's meal if i'm [79:51] using raw dog meat i like to stuff kongs [79:54] and and bones with raw dog meat then [79:57] that i will also subtract a little bit [79:59] from the dog's main meal because of [80:01] course we don't want our dogs to get [80:03] overweight and most people over feed [80:05] their dogs a good thing to do is to [80:08] weigh your food so weighing your food or [80:10] using a measuring cup so if you're using [80:12] kibble always measure what you're [80:14] feeding if you're using raw then [80:17] using a scale is a really great way to [80:19] keep accountability of how much you're [80:21] giving your dog each day and if you have [80:23] a family and everybody is interacting [80:25] with the dogs and giving them treats and [80:27] training them then take what the dog [80:29] should consume throughout the day so the [80:31] dog's rations for the day put that in [80:34] one location everyone in the family [80:36] knows it's there and that's what you use [80:38] from once that's out the dog's done for [80:41] the day you don't want to over feed them [80:44] and that's something that i've seen [80:45] common a real common issue with big [80:47] families because everybody's giving the [80:48] dog treats and there's no accountability [80:50] and you end up having a very overweight [80:52] dog which of course is not good for [80:54] their health [80:55] which that reminds me if you have a dog [80:57] make sure in the description of all my [80:59] videos i do have the uh one of the [81:01] sponsors for my channel prudent pet [81:04] insurance i use them if you don't have [81:06] pet insurance definitely check them out [81:09] they're great and that this was uh just [81:11] a shout out for them because they've [81:13] helped me we had one issue fifteen [81:15] hundred dollars i mean they took care of [81:17] it like that it was great all right i'll [81:18] do one more i know i said that was the [81:20] last one is there a remote collar that [81:22] you recommend [81:24] uh i like dogtra i like the dogtra arc [81:27] e-collar technology has some really good [81:29] ones and then if you saw the interview [81:31] that i did with jacob placencia [81:35] i did that a few months ago i think [81:38] he talks about a dog collar brand let me [81:42] see i'm gonna pull the video up [81:45] uh [81:46] chameleon so chameleon i haven't [81:49] personally used chameleon but based on [81:51] what he said it seems like a really [81:53] exceptional collar [81:55] but it's just like anything you get what [81:57] you pay for and that's one of the most [81:59] expensive ones i think he told me it's [82:01] around eight hundred dollars [82:02] for a chameleon dog [82:05] remote training collar dogtra is between [82:08] 175 you might be able to find one of [82:11] their cheaper collars up to around 450 [82:14] and then e-collar technology is very [82:16] similar as far as prices with dogtra [82:19] it's going to come down to preference [82:21] one of the things that chameleon had [82:22] that he was telling me about was it the [82:25] collar will let you know if it's [82:27] actually correcting the dog so with dog [82:30] tread e-collar technology you'll know [82:32] when you're pressing the button [82:34] because the light on the collar will [82:35] indicate but that doesn't mean that it's [82:37] actually making contact with the dog [82:40] the chameleon collars will let you know [82:42] if it's actually making contact and the [82:44] dog is receiving the correction [82:46] that's not usually an issue if you're [82:48] working short-haired dogs short-haired [82:50] dogs it's very easy to make sure that [82:52] the connectors are touching no problem [82:54] but if you're working with dogs that [82:56] have larger or not larger thicker coats [82:59] so your huskies your german shepherds [83:02] your chow chows these dogs that have [83:03] really thick coats that's much more [83:06] difficult because it's hard to get [83:08] through that thick coat and they have [83:09] certain connectors that are designed [83:11] specifically to make it easier to get [83:13] through that and what i do when i put [83:14] the collar on i go up and down on the [83:16] dog's neck to make sure that it gets [83:18] through that coat and it's connecting [83:20] which is important so those are the [83:22] three main ones there's also garmin [83:25] garmin's a little bit more expensive and [83:27] i don't like that one as much as doctor [83:29] and e-collar but dogtray is usually my [83:31] go-to so [83:32] that's it for today we're going to be [83:34] doing another one of these videos [83:36] something else that i'm going to do as [83:38] well besides my own so probably i'll [83:41] probably do about five of mine and then [83:43] one of another dog trainers video so if [83:46] there's any dog trainer videos you want [83:48] to discuss or you want me to discuss on [83:50] this channel let me know in the comments [83:54] it will not be don't expect me to do [83:58] a video on another dog trainer's video [84:01] as a way to [84:02] bash on the dog training i will only [84:05] point out things that i like that i [84:06] agree with that are valuable it's not to [84:10] talk down on other dog trainers but i [84:12] think discussing other trainers could be [84:14] very valuable so if there's any certain [84:16] videos that any one of you would like me [84:18] to just discuss in one of these i'm [84:19] going to try to do one of these almost [84:21] every day as long as my schedule allows [84:24] for it [84:25] and i'll try to post within a day or so [84:27] before doing it so there's going to be a [84:29] lot of these if you're a channel member [84:31] you have priority to the questions just [84:34] like i did today [84:36] but [84:37] try to keep the questions related to the [84:40] video that we're going to be discussing [84:42] i wanted to be directly relate to that [84:44] video and then afterwards we can discuss [84:46] anything else that anybody else might be [84:48] having questions on so i wasn't able to [84:51] get through all the questions it was a [84:52] lot but thanks for watching thanks for [84:54] tuning in thanks for supporting the [84:56] channel and i will see everybody in the [84:58] next video ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2022-06-04_Amaze_Your_Friends_with_These_5_Easy-to-Learn_Dog_Tricks.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 403/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] welcome back to another episode this is [00:02] episode two in a three episode series of [00:05] tricks here in georgia with professional [00:08] dog trainer maureen cuccinella and we're [00:11] going to be going over five more awesome [00:13] and unique dog training tricks let's get [00:16] started okay so the next trick that [00:17] we're going to be doing is the rebound [00:19] so that's where a dog jumps off of a [00:21] wall it looks like doggy parkour um so [00:24] you can have the dog jump up a wall a [00:25] tree a pole in the future even off of [00:28] yourself if your dog is the right size [00:30] so [00:31] basically what i do is i have a surface [00:34] that i can slowly raise right here this [00:37] is just a corona bed place bed [00:40] cot whatever these work pretty good for [00:42] this trick you just have to support them [00:44] to make sure they're stable so [00:46] first i start off with just getting the [00:47] dog up onto it and then off of it giving [00:49] them that motion of going up and off up [00:53] and off and then we slowly increase it [00:55] and eventually get it on [00:57] straight up on the wall [00:59] so griffin here has never learned this [01:01] trick okay so this is something brand [01:04] new to him he's probably gonna make some [01:05] mistakes and that's okay you can see how [01:07] we work through those things okay so i [01:09] just have the surface here [01:11] griffin [01:14] yes and i just lure him onto it i mark [01:16] and then i can use my terminal marker [01:18] break to release him and get the snack [01:21] okay and i'm gonna do the same thing [01:23] this time i'm gonna do it the other way [01:25] griffin [01:28] yes [01:30] break [01:31] just like that okay [01:33] griffin [01:35] yes [01:36] break [01:38] right so i'm not using any cues with [01:40] this yet until i have what i want so [01:42] it's going to be a few sessions before i [01:44] ever say anything i'm just getting him [01:46] used to this exercise in the motion [01:49] yes [01:51] break [01:52] okay when the dog is pretty confident [01:54] about that like griffin's very [01:55] confidence this with this object he's [01:56] been up on it to it he's been hooked [01:59] onto it and off of it plenty of times so [02:01] he's familiar with this so i'm going to [02:03] start to increase [02:05] that um that slope so that way we [02:08] actually start getting it onto the pole [02:12] so i'm going to increase it like this [02:15] just a little bit nothing too much [02:16] increasing that incline [02:18] and i have my leg here very important i [02:21] have my leg here supporting [02:23] the object upwards you see that it can't [02:26] slide around anywhere i can't slide over [02:27] there it's stable [02:30] so i lure him up yes [02:32] free and then he gets off so it's very [02:34] important that we try to get the dog's [02:36] front feet and back feet onto here if [02:38] your dog is just offering their front [02:40] feet the first session yes i will pay [02:42] that but over time like maybe that [02:44] second session i'm going to ask for more [02:47] and then more okay so i'm gonna lure him [02:49] up here [02:50] yes all four feet are on and then break [02:53] use my terminal marker and release him [02:56] griffin [02:58] yes [02:59] break [03:00] just like that and i like to throw the [03:02] snack so i can stay in this spot and it [03:04] increases speed and gets that motion and [03:06] that push that i'm looking for griffin [03:09] oopsie [03:11] come on buddy [03:13] yes [03:14] break [03:15] good boy [03:17] all right so he's good at this um [03:20] incline right here because he's very [03:21] confident about it he's offering the [03:23] behavior break all on his own so i'm [03:25] going to increase it some more [03:27] just a little bit more have my foot here [03:29] and support it [03:32] good boy ready can you do more [03:35] yes he's going up on there on his own [03:38] break and i'm releasing him off of it [03:40] again this dog has never learned this [03:41] before if your dog is very familiar with [03:43] the object they're going to be a lot [03:44] more confident about it [03:47] break i'm sorry wrong word [03:49] break there we go [03:52] griffin [03:54] yes [03:56] break [03:57] just like that now i'm going to do it a [03:59] little bit more i'm doing this pretty [04:00] fast with him he's getting it quickly [04:02] some dogs will not be this quick when i [04:04] first did this with monster it took us a [04:06] while she was uncomfortable with this so [04:08] i had to really um [04:10] work at each step whereas this dog here [04:13] is very environmentally solid he can [04:15] jump on top of some of the craziest [04:17] object and he's comfortable ready [04:19] yes [04:21] break just like that so increased it [04:23] more he's doing great with that as well [04:25] griffin [04:27] come on buddy i know there's crumbs [04:29] there [04:30] ready to try again [04:32] i know i know i'm getting crumbs [04:33] everywhere now [04:35] come on come on come on yes [04:37] break [04:38] and throw it [04:39] good i like that he's kind of climbing [04:41] up onto it and then getting off griffin [04:47] good boy yes [04:49] break [04:50] good boy [04:51] increase it some more [04:53] gotta reload really quick [05:00] all right ready buddy [05:07] yes oh break whatever dude right so [05:10] there he got a little bit not too [05:12] comfortable because of this incline [05:14] totally normal don't make a big deal out [05:16] of it i just threw some more snacks for [05:18] him [05:19] griffin ready [05:21] yes [05:22] break [05:23] good boy so [05:25] i'm going to just go ahead and start [05:26] naming this so you guys can see how that [05:28] goes about um realistically [05:32] if i'm really trying to teach him this [05:33] i'm going to work on this part for a [05:35] while because you can see now he's [05:36] struggling a little bit because it's [05:37] much more vertical as opposed to where [05:39] it was so [05:41] if i'm working on this or if you're [05:42] working on this with your dogs and [05:44] they're at this point i would work on [05:46] this [05:47] more before adding the cube but for [05:49] teaching sync we're going to use a cue [05:50] right now [05:51] rebound [05:54] yes right so pay him right here break [05:57] it's okay that little one that's what [05:58] one foot was off there right now again [06:00] first session doing this we're okay [06:02] rebound [06:04] there we go [06:06] yes there we go [06:08] ain't nobody [06:11] rebound [06:15] good boy good well you got this buddy [06:17] you got this [06:18] so i'm going to decrease it for him [06:20] because now he's having a little [06:21] difficulty so when this happens with [06:23] your dogs because it will it's okay to [06:25] go back rebound [06:28] yes good boy [06:30] brick [06:31] you see i keep my knee here so he goes [06:33] higher [06:34] and over time i can increase this more [06:36] and eventually get it flat and just use [06:39] my knee [06:40] and lure him [06:42] up and over my knee okay and eventually [06:45] when the dog is really comfortable with [06:46] that you can take this out of the [06:48] picture [06:49] rebound and the dog bounces right off [06:51] the wall okay so it takes some time to [06:53] build some confidence at this one super [06:56] awesome trick when it's done [06:57] take your time don't rush it and make [07:00] sure that object stays as stable as you [07:02] can alright and that's how you teach [07:04] your rebound [07:05] pretty [07:06] the next trick we're going to work on is [07:08] rewind so rewind is where the dog [07:11] goes backwards rewind in a circle behind [07:13] you just like this yes it's really good [07:15] for rear end awareness by the way you [07:17] might see her sneeze when she does this [07:19] because she thinks she's supposed to do [07:20] that too because i rewarded it [07:23] but the dog goes backwards in a circle [07:25] around you on cue rewind and then [07:28] sometimes i do a little not that one [07:29] rewind there we go [07:32] yes very good but it's really nice for [07:34] rear end awareness i use it a lot in [07:36] healing to help make healing more [07:37] interesting and especially for that back [07:39] up about turn where the dog goes [07:42] backwards behind you when you turn left [07:44] so [07:46] i have food in both hands okay so my [07:48] left hand and my right hand [07:50] when i'm first teaching this i have to [07:51] have the lure right from the dog's face [07:53] i want the dog constantly licking it not [07:55] the lure up here right down here they're [07:58] licking it and they're moving so i take [08:00] that lure and i try to turn her head [08:02] left so her butt goes back yes and i [08:04] mark that slight motion okay so [08:07] food in both hands [08:09] my left hand i turn her head left and [08:12] then that's going to make her butt go [08:13] right and go behind me now dogs in the [08:15] beginning are going to have a little bit [08:16] of issue with that they're going to be [08:18] like wait a minute i'm moving my head [08:19] their body's going to wiggle around [08:20] anymore pay any effort you see toward [08:24] the end goal of the dog going backwards [08:26] around you all right not gonna be [08:27] perfect at first reward any little [08:29] effort the dog gives you so [08:32] over time you'll be able to easily get [08:33] the dog to move like this yes and be [08:35] behind you okay that's like the first [08:37] goal we work towards is you can take the [08:39] food put it right in their face turn the [08:41] head left and their body goes behind you [08:43] yes and you might have the shoulder at [08:44] your back legs that's what i'm looking [08:46] for so when we get to this part that's [08:49] where i need to use my other hand okay [08:51] so my left hand [08:53] i'll get her to push her as far as i can [08:55] and then i'm going to switch [08:57] and i'm going to turn her body yes and [09:00] then this is where that next step is [09:02] right so the first step is just getting [09:03] her head to turn her butt to turn some [09:05] then behind me and now i'm looking at [09:07] getting my right hand to push her over [09:10] here on my right side all right [09:13] i'm going to show that again [09:15] okay so [09:16] food and left hand we turn the dog's [09:18] head yes dog rotates their butt [09:21] to your right then i switch hands when [09:23] the dog's head is right behind me and i [09:26] turn her head left and she should move [09:28] just as so okay it took her a little bit [09:31] to get this one too [09:32] took her a little bit to get a lot of [09:33] tricks in the beginning so any little [09:35] effort i just paid and i built on it [09:37] okay so then i could push the dog yes [09:40] right back to my left side over here [09:42] okay i'm gonna do this quite a few times [09:45] food in both hands left hand [09:47] turn her head to the left so her butt [09:50] goes backwards [09:51] good [09:53] switching hands when she's behind me yes [09:56] and then pushing her up to rotate out in [09:58] front here this part might be a little [09:59] hard for your dog at first they may they [10:01] might go more this way that's okay you [10:03] can make that radius smaller and smaller [10:05] and then i want to yes and where she [10:08] starts okay so she starts here she goes [10:11] backwards and then th that is where the [10:12] command ends as well she should do a [10:14] full circle backwards behind you and [10:16] then over time rewind you can start to [10:18] add the cue [10:19] yes and you can start to use less food [10:21] okay so there i didn't reward her back [10:24] here i rewarded her over this way okay i [10:26] rewarded her when she got here [10:28] rewind take the food push her in [10:31] yes i didn't even reward this part right [10:33] here right so over time you can see okay [10:35] my dog's got this turn i don't have to [10:37] reward that anymore i'll reward when the [10:39] dog gets over here and then eventually [10:41] rewind you can just get the dog to do it [10:42] on a hand signal yes and the verbal cue [10:45] good job [10:47] free [10:48] nice and that is how you teach the [10:50] rewind next up is limping okay so in [10:53] order to teach this dog first your dog [10:55] has to know how to give you their left [10:57] paw or their right paw you can even do [11:00] both and eventually teach a nice little [11:02] skip which is super cute um but today [11:04] we're just going to focus on one paul [11:05] just to make things really easy so paul [11:07] very simple trick [11:09] there's youtube tutorials about paw [11:11] everywhere i'm not going to go over that [11:12] i'm going to go over the limping side [11:14] okay so i have a platform here [11:16] to keep her on so that way she doesn't [11:18] get too anxious and move around so much [11:21] so it can be useful in the beginning but [11:23] i wouldn't say you absolutely need your [11:24] dog to be on a platform you can do this [11:26] straight on the ground but she's a very [11:27] eager dog she's going to offer me all [11:29] sorts of stuff unless i have a nice [11:30] answer here for her so i'm going to get [11:32] her standing stand [11:34] come on that's a girl so [11:37] after your dog knows right paul how to [11:39] give you their paw like this yes and are [11:41] very good about that we now need to get [11:43] the dog comfortable standing still and [11:46] keeping their paw in the air with you [11:47] being further away because the goal of [11:49] this exercise is to say lint the dog [11:51] lifts their paw and then they walk as [11:53] their paw is up stand good girl so she [11:56] knows paw giving it to my hand so i'm [11:59] going to use this to build some distance [12:02] so this is just a telescoping shoe horn [12:04] really love this thing it's very useful [12:06] for if i want to build more distance [12:08] with the command versus always having to [12:10] be up in the dog's space so [12:13] i'm going to tell her right paul and i'm [12:14] going to put this right under her paw [12:15] yes so that she almost grabs it with [12:18] that right paw that's what i'm looking [12:19] for so that way she learns how to stand [12:22] with her paw up because this can be [12:23] really hard for yes that was really cute [12:25] sorry she did something i've been [12:26] working on her with for i just marked [12:27] and reward it [12:29] so stand [12:31] good girl right paul [12:32] and i just get the dog to hold on to [12:34] this yes and stand for a little bit and [12:37] then eventually we're going to move [12:38] forward right paul [12:42] yes very nice [12:44] right paul [12:47] almost [12:48] there we go [12:50] yes good job very good so when the dog [12:53] is able to stand with their right paw or [12:55] left paw being up that is where i can [12:57] move on to the next step okay especially [12:59] if she's doing it on her own right paul [13:02] you see that yes that dog has a lot of [13:04] confidence and stability in the behavior [13:06] so this really helped me out with that [13:08] okay whereas it would have been a lot [13:09] harder to build that with just using my [13:11] hand monster free so i'm going to get [13:13] her off of here now because i wanted to [13:14] get her moving [13:19] come on baby [13:21] sit [13:22] good so stand [13:25] there we go we gotta work on our stands [13:26] don't we good girl so she knows exactly [13:28] what we're doing [13:29] i'm gonna have a lure in my right hand [13:31] and then i'm gonna have my little stick [13:33] right here in my left hand so i'm going [13:35] to keep her still with the food [13:38] right paul put this right under her [13:40] right paw [13:41] come on baby yes oh great paul [13:44] i know [13:45] come on [13:47] i know we're going back steps yes [13:50] there we go i had it under the wrong leg [13:52] and i'm going to lure her forward yes [13:54] while i hold that paw upwards [13:56] yes and i mark [13:58] as she moves forward with her paw up [14:00] good girl i'm going to show you this a [14:02] couple times [14:03] right paul [14:04] yes [14:06] right paw [14:08] yes good job and so [14:11] over time you'll feel that she's going [14:12] to your that your dog is going to put a [14:13] lot less pressure on here and they're [14:15] going to start doing it on their own [14:17] okay right paul [14:19] so that's where i have this next to it [14:20] yes just in case they need a little bit [14:22] of help but at first the dog is solely [14:24] relying on this they are putting all [14:25] their weight on here until they get that [14:27] in their muscle memory this takes time [14:30] just like with all the other tricks it [14:31] takes some time so be patient and do [14:33] quite a bit of repetitions but keep it [14:35] short okay like five minutes or so so [14:38] um having it next to her paw right paw [14:41] using the food to lure her forward yes [14:44] right [14:45] yes right and at this point [14:48] now i can start to introduce the word [14:50] limp okay [14:51] good girl ready bring her back over here [14:55] lymph [14:56] yes [14:58] yes good job [15:00] yes [15:01] just like that and also i'm not saying [15:02] link over again you just need to say it [15:04] one time and that way you can get [15:06] multiple steps just on one cue so when [15:08] the dog's doing it really well [15:10] with the stick near them [15:13] but not um relying on it i can just put [15:15] this off to the side monster [15:17] and then i can ask for the limp [15:20] limp and i do this little hand signal [15:21] here [15:23] good girl [15:24] good job [15:26] break yay [15:28] and then you have a nice limp and like i [15:30] said earlier if you teach it with the [15:32] dog's other paw which is what we're [15:33] working on right now the dog so for her [15:35] her left paw you can teach him how to [15:36] switch and actually do a cute little [15:39] skip all right so super fun dog trick [15:41] that's a trick that lassie is famous for [15:44] the limp [15:45] not yes [15:48] that was better [15:53] i have monster here and we're going to [15:55] teach you how to teach your dog to nod [15:57] their head like they're saying yes okay [15:59] so first your dog needs to have [16:01] understanding of what a target stick is [16:03] so this one here has a little foam top [16:05] on it so it makes it very clear where i [16:06] want the dog's nose to hit and so first [16:09] you want to introduce the stick make [16:10] sure your dog yes understands that when [16:12] they're presented with that target stick [16:14] to actually touch that target stick like [16:17] that i didn't mark there but she she got [16:19] her food [16:20] touch yes and you want to have a cue [16:22] with it whether it's touch or target or [16:25] whatever yes very good so after your dog [16:28] can touch it above their head to the [16:30] side of their head yes and below them so [16:33] the below the chin is probably the [16:35] hardest [16:36] yes to get after your dog can get that [16:38] one you are now ready to teach your dog [16:41] how to nod so [16:43] basically i take this and i just put it [16:45] yes downwards and she touches it and i [16:47] pay her [16:49] yes good job [16:53] yes good job and you'll notice i have [16:55] her on the platform so that way she's [16:56] not crawling off of it crawling towards [16:58] me again very eager dog [17:01] yes very good so you see how she's very [17:03] easily yes touching it when it's below [17:06] her so now i can start add the q to it [17:08] okay [17:09] very important we're saying the q before [17:12] we're introducing the help aka the [17:14] target so i'll say [17:16] not and then i'll yes [17:19] have her touch it just like that [17:22] nod [17:23] yes [17:24] very nice [17:28] nod [17:30] yes and you'll see she's going to start [17:31] to anticipate when she hears the word [17:34] nod the target stick is going to be [17:36] prevent uh presented right below her and [17:39] she used to touch that target so she'll [17:40] start to beat you to that and therefore [17:42] nodding on her own nod [17:45] yes which is why it's very important we [17:47] have that break between the word nod and [17:50] when that target's presented so the dog [17:52] has a chance to do the behavior without [17:54] the help [17:55] okay that's very pretty mad [17:57] yes very good now my word there was a [17:59] little too close to my presentation of [18:01] the help [18:03] not [18:05] yes very good but that's exactly what [18:07] i'm looking for that break and then [18:08] eventually you get this really nice [18:11] nod of their head really fun for uh [18:13] certain tricks or maybe even videos of [18:15] having your dog not the head to a song [18:17] it's really cute but yeah that's how you [18:18] teach mad next up is how to teach your [18:21] dog to cover their eyes so you're going [18:23] to need some tape so i got some scotch [18:24] tape right here [18:26] and basically we teach us through [18:27] capturing so capturing is where the dog [18:29] does something naturally we mark it we [18:31] reward it and then we eventually name it [18:33] when we can predict that's going to [18:34] happen so [18:36] i have the tape [18:37] i'm going to put it on his nose and he's [18:39] going to try to whack it off as soon as [18:40] he tries to whack it off his nose i'm [18:42] gonna mark yes and i'm going to pay him [18:44] all right you thought you he thought i [18:45] marked you huh so i put this right on [18:47] his nose he's already anticipating it [18:51] yes and so i'll mark and then i'll pay [18:54] yes yes i mark and i pay you get a bonus [18:59] yes good boy [19:02] and i pay so he's doing it very [19:03] consistently so i would name it with him [19:05] right away [19:06] cover yes so i just say cover personally [19:09] and he whacked the tape off it's on his [19:11] foot now yay super fun [19:13] here we go [19:14] okay so we're gonna put more on his nose [19:16] now [19:17] got some slobber [19:18] it'll probably get a little slobbery [19:20] when you're doing this expect that and [19:21] put that right on his nose here oh he is [19:23] drooling yes i didn't get a chance to [19:26] cover tell you the command [19:28] cover yes [19:30] good boy [19:31] yes good job cover yes [19:34] good job [19:36] cover yes and within one within that [19:39] same session if he's doing it [19:40] consistently i'm going to try taking the [19:42] tape off right this one is as a command [19:44] that's learned really quickly cover yes [19:47] and if for any reason your dog is having [19:48] a hard time doing it without the tape [19:50] when they have the tape on i'll just tap [19:51] their nose and give him a little hand [19:52] signal like that but he's doing it so [19:54] consistently he knows what's up so i'm [19:57] going to go ahead and add the key with [19:59] it let's get this tape off your foot all [20:01] right [20:01] so i'm going to tell them cover [20:06] all right got distracted some food cover [20:08] yes good boy he recognized that little [20:10] hand signal from me booping his nose [20:12] with the tape on it right so he was able [20:13] to understand oh yeah i got to put my [20:15] foot over my nose cover [20:17] yes good job [20:19] very good boy [20:21] and that's

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 406/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everybody welcome back to another [00:03] live q a uh and video analysis so what [00:07] we're gonna be talking about is [00:12] i lost the video i had it up here [00:14] but it's the terminal marker [00:18] versus the continuation marker [00:23] or continuation marker versus the [00:25] terminal marker [00:27] okay so in the video it's a pretty quick [00:29] short straightforward video what you [00:32] want to keep in mind when you're using [00:33] these two different markers and [00:35] as you do something for a long time you [00:37] start to learn ways in which it's easier [00:40] to explain and transfer that information [00:42] over to somebody else and what i've [00:44] learned is telling people [00:47] more about what our words predict to our [00:50] dogs makes it much easier to understand [00:53] the word and know how to use it so we [00:55] have the continuation marker in the [00:57] terminal marker in the beginning i talk [00:59] about the continuation marker letting [01:01] the dog know that they are correct but [01:03] they have to come to us to get the [01:05] reward now as i just mentioned it's much [01:07] easier to think about what the word [01:09] predicts and if we simplify it it's [01:12] going to make the process even that much [01:13] easier a continuation marker all it does [01:17] is it predicts a reward that is it in my [01:20] videos i use the word yes so when i tell [01:22] my dogs yes i'm letting them know that [01:25] they're going to get a reward that's it [01:27] now the primary reinforcers because our [01:30] markers are the condition reinforces the [01:32] primary reinforcers is what the [01:34] condition reinforcer predicts [01:37] primary food toy or affection now when [01:39] i'm working with dogs i reserve my [01:41] markers as a predictor for food or toys [01:44] since we pet our dogs all the time i [01:47] don't like to use a marker as a [01:49] predictor for petting i prefer to [01:52] predict either a piece of food or a toy [01:56] and then in the video i say a terminal [01:58] marker lets a dog know they're correct [02:00] they're done with the exercise and they [02:02] can come and get the reward again let's [02:05] simplify it a little bit more all the [02:07] terminal marker means is they're going [02:09] to receive a reward and they are [02:11] released from the position now if our [02:13] dog is not in a commanded stay position [02:17] then they're not being released from [02:19] anything so we don't really have to [02:21] worry about it if we look at the [02:23] step-by-step process that i teach in my [02:26] videos and in my manual number one [02:28] remember is that engagement training [02:30] this is where we are teaching our dogs [02:32] the different markers that we're going [02:33] to be using while we're training them [02:36] it's a very simple process we have the [02:38] dogs look at us once they look at us we [02:40] mark that behavior letting them know [02:42] that looking at us is a good thing and [02:44] then we follow it up with the delivery [02:45] of the reward [02:47] and i just want to say hi back to [02:48] everyone who said hi so far sorry i'm [02:51] trying to get through the information so [02:52] i can go right to the q a portion [02:55] because i know that's what most people [02:57] really care about they like that q a [02:59] portion and being able to have their [03:01] questions answered [03:05] okay excellent [03:07] um so again going back to those two [03:08] different markers now step one we get [03:10] them conditioned to the markers step two [03:13] is where we start using our technique of [03:15] luring in order to get our dogs to do [03:17] the behaviors we're trying to teach them [03:19] and if you know how to handle food [03:20] correctly i do have an episode on this i [03:23] think it's called power steering [03:24] something like that but it's a technique [03:26] where the way in which you handle the [03:28] food makes it much easier to teach our [03:31] dogs different behaviors if you watch [03:33] the trick video that i just posted [03:35] maureen cuccinella is doing an exercise [03:38] where she has her dog going around her [03:40] in the heel position walking backwards [03:42] and if you notice the way she's holding [03:44] the food and the way she's turning her [03:46] hand is really making the uh it's [03:49] helping determine the direction of the [03:51] dog's body where the head goes [03:54] the body follows [03:56] and [03:57] with that second step when we're first [03:58] teaching our dog sit down come heel [04:02] center spin climb off all these [04:05] different behaviors we're not saying a [04:07] command now that's something that people [04:09] always ask about they say well shouldn't [04:11] i start naming the behavior right away [04:14] no and just like [04:17] i talked about in the last live video [04:19] that we did [04:21] when i was doing staying trains with [04:23] different dogs i always had the [04:25] adjustment period where i wanted to make [04:27] sure the dog was adjusted and [04:29] comfortable in their new environment [04:31] before i started asking them for a bunch [04:34] of different commands and trying to do [04:36] obedience with them because if we start [04:38] training our dogs [04:39] when they're uncomfortable or when [04:41] they're anxious when they're not in the [04:43] right mindset then they're going to [04:44] associate that feeling with the training [04:46] so we always want to make sure they're [04:47] in the best possible mood in order to [04:50] transfer that over to the way they feel [04:52] about the [04:54] training when we first start shaping [04:57] different behaviors we want our dogs to [04:59] be able to focus on that physical cue [05:02] just like humans dogs cannot multitask [05:05] they focus on one thing at a time and i [05:07] know a lot of people think that they can [05:08] multitask but the science has proven [05:11] that we do not multitask we task switch [05:14] we switch back and forth from different [05:16] things if we're trying to multitask and [05:17] we'll never do it as good as focusing on [05:20] one specific thing that we're trying to [05:22] accomplish so dogs cannot multitask so [05:25] we get them to understand that concept [05:26] of following the lure now there's a few [05:28] things that makes this valuable by not [05:31] adding the commands we don't have to [05:33] worry about the stay now as many of you [05:35] know i like to teach the implied stay [05:38] meaning when we tell our dogs to go into [05:40] a commanded position [05:42] they are in a stay there are three ways [05:44] to maintain the state there are three [05:46] ways to release a dog from a state so if [05:48] i tell a dog to sit and they sit down if [05:50] i use the continuation marker they're in [05:53] a sit stay if i tell a dog to sit and [05:55] they sit down and i provide them with [05:57] verbal praise good boy good girl nice [06:00] job they're in a sit stay if i tell a [06:02] dog to sit and they sit and i say [06:04] nothing they're in a sit stay the three [06:06] ways we release them from the stay is we [06:09] can either use our terminal marker again [06:11] release and reward we can give them a [06:14] new command or we can use a release word [06:17] now you might be asking yourself what's [06:19] the difference between a release word [06:21] and a terminal marker the difference is [06:24] the release word even though when you [06:25] release a dog so i use the word break [06:28] and if you watch my videos you've [06:29] probably seen me release a dog with the [06:31] word break and then give them a piece of [06:32] food and you might be thinking yourself [06:34] well that's the same thing you release [06:36] the dog you gave him a piece of food the [06:38] difference is the release word only [06:40] guarantees a release [06:42] you can reward them after you use a [06:44] release word but unlike the terminal [06:46] marker if you use the terminal marker [06:48] just like if you use the continuation [06:50] marker we pay our dogs that is what [06:53] makes these words so valuable and so [06:56] powerful [06:58] going back to the video i use the [07:00] example where the dog is 10 feet away [07:02] actually sorry i'm jumping around that's [07:04] my add kicking in so the second step [07:06] we're just luring our dogs into the [07:08] different positions so since we're [07:09] luring dogs into different positions if [07:12] i lure the dog into the sit the moment [07:14] the dog's butt hits the ground i mark it [07:16] and then i give the dog a reward in that [07:18] situation can you use the continuation [07:20] marker or the terminal marker and if you [07:23] said yes you are correct it doesn't [07:25] matter which marker you use during step [07:27] two of my training shaping the behaviors [07:30] using a physical lure or physical cue [07:32] because we haven't commanded the dog to [07:34] go into a [07:35] position so therefore there is no stay [07:38] so if we say our continuation marker [07:41] doesn't make it a stay [07:43] and if we say a terminal marker well the [07:45] dog is going to be rewarded and they're [07:46] released but they're not being released [07:48] from anything so it really doesn't [07:49] matter during step two you can use a [07:51] continuation marker or the terminal [07:53] marker now what i do recommend is [07:57] when we [07:58] are training our dogs and this is [08:01] something i talked about in the video [08:02] that we're discussing right now [08:05] depending on the type of dog we're [08:06] working with will depend on which marker [08:09] you should be using more often than the [08:11] other if you're working on a dog that [08:12] really doesn't have that much motivation [08:14] or maybe just an average level [08:16] motivation dog then we can use a [08:18] terminal marker this is going to help [08:20] increase the motivation it's going to [08:22] increase the speed remember speed is [08:24] based on motivation and it's going to [08:26] make the training more fun and engaging [08:28] which will make the dog become a little [08:29] bit more excited and amped up during [08:32] each training session increasing that [08:33] energy and desire to learn and train [08:35] with you if you have a dog that's overly [08:37] excited that [08:39] really is constantly moving a good [08:41] example is my dog charlie [08:44] then it's better to use the continuation [08:46] marker just to kind of slow them down a [08:48] little bit so they're not going to be as [08:50] excited now step three is when we start [08:53] teaching our dog leash pressure during [08:55] step three same thing it doesn't matter [08:57] really if we use continuation marker or [08:59] our terminal marker because the dog is [09:01] not in a commanded position so we don't [09:03] have to worry about releasing them from [09:05] anything [09:06] once we get to step four and we start [09:08] teaching our dogs the commands now it [09:10] matters now when i first start teaching [09:12] the dog commands i do like to use the [09:15] terminal marker almost exclusively in [09:17] the very beginning and the main reason [09:20] why is because we don't want to have to [09:21] worry about the stay [09:23] if i'm doing sit and i cue the dog into [09:26] the sit the dog sits and i use the [09:28] terminal marker for me it's the word [09:29] free then the dog can jump up and i can [09:32] reward the dog and we can go right to [09:34] the other exercise so it does a couple [09:36] of things [09:38] one it [09:39] increases the motivation as we already [09:41] talked about two we don't have to worry [09:43] about the stay and three it helps us get [09:47] through way more repetitions of [09:49] different behaviors during a short [09:52] training session so we have a five to [09:55] ten minute training session and we're [09:57] able to do [09:58] so many different repetitions in that [10:00] amount of time when we're using the [10:02] terminal markers sit free reward down [10:05] free reward heal free reward and we're [10:08] not worried about the stay at this point [10:09] and since we have the dog engaged with [10:11] us because of step one we're not worried [10:13] about the dog losing focus getting [10:15] distracted and going somewhere else or [10:17] picking up something off the ground we [10:19] have that engagement if you are worried [10:20] about that keep a leash on so you can [10:22] use that leash pressure cue that we [10:24] taught our dogs [10:26] okay so now going back to the video i [10:27] talk about the example where the dog's [10:29] 10 feet away if they sit if i tell a dog [10:31] to sit that's far away or if you tell a [10:33] dog to sit that's far away the dog sits [10:35] and you use the continuation marker [10:37] if you're doing the implied stay then [10:39] you would have to walk over and reward [10:42] your dog you don't have to run to your [10:44] dog to get the reward because remember [10:46] our dogs once they're conditioned to the [10:48] marker we have as long as it takes us to [10:51] get the reward to the dog without losing [10:54] the connection as long as the dog [10:56] maintains focus so as long as the dog is [10:59] focused on us and they're maintaining [11:01] that attention we have as long as it [11:02] takes and if you have your dog's [11:04] conditioned any sort of sound it doesn't [11:06] even really have to be a marker if you [11:08] do something with your dogs like who's [11:10] hungry are you ready for dinner or you [11:11] want to go outside and what does a dog [11:13] do they get really excited they get [11:15] happy because they know what that [11:17] predicts it doesn't mean once you say do [11:19] you want to go outside you have to run [11:20] them outside the front door they're [11:22] going to forget what happened remember [11:23] our dogs are not goldfish [11:25] so once you mark the behavior you walk [11:28] to them and you give the dog the reward [11:30] if you use the terminal marker then your [11:31] dog can jump up and your dog can do a [11:33] couple things they can come to you to [11:34] get the reward if you have the reward on [11:36] your person or you can have a reward off [11:39] to the side where the dog can get the [11:41] reward and then come back to you there's [11:43] different ways of doing it now some [11:45] people will use different markers for [11:47] different types of terminal markers we [11:49] can say so they have a terminal marker [11:52] that lets a dog know to come to them to [11:53] get the reward they have a terminal [11:55] marker that lets their dog know to go [11:56] and get the reward from somewhere else [11:59] i'll just use the same word in that [12:01] situation [12:02] then we talk about uh the stay and i [12:05] talk a little bit about making fun of [12:07] the hand signal where people walk away [12:08] and they're like stay stay [12:11] some people like to use the word stay [12:14] and that is completely okay [12:16] stay will not saying stay will not have [12:18] a negative impact on the training but [12:21] what i recommend is we always want to [12:23] make sure that our words do predict [12:25] something so what i've had success with [12:27] when adding the stay command is showing [12:30] the dog that once i say stay what do we [12:33] want it to mean well we want the dog to [12:34] stay there but it also often means we're [12:36] walking away and that's a good way to [12:38] start teaching it in the very beginning [12:39] so we go stay and then we walk away if [12:41] the dog breaks depending on the stage of [12:43] the training we can use the marker that [12:45] predicts negative reinforcement the [12:47] leash pressure that's my word wrong or [12:49] we can use our marker that predicts [12:51] positive punishment implement a [12:53] correction recommand place a dog in the [12:55] commanded position depending on where [12:57] the dog is in the training but you can [12:59] say stay again if you want it will not [13:01] have a negative impact on the training [13:04] sorry my computer screen just shut off [13:06] okay okay [13:08] um let's see when to use each marker [13:10] excited dog increasing the speed we hit [13:12] all those bullet points already uh [13:14] talking about speed motivation the more [13:16] motivated the dog is the faster they're [13:18] going to move i do have a video [13:20] specifically on increasing your dog's [13:22] speed [13:23] i use the fetch example in the video [13:25] have you ever seen a dog play fetch and [13:27] walk to get the ball maybe if the dog [13:28] doesn't care to play fetch and they're [13:30] being forced to do it but if the dog [13:31] enjoys playing fetch they run at it so [13:33] again motivation will increase our dog [13:36] speed [13:39] and then yeah that's pretty much it so [13:41] that's the video we covered everything i [13:43] talked obviously in way more detail [13:45] since it's a five minute video but now [13:47] we're gonna go to questions that i'm [13:49] gonna answer i'm gonna start with my [13:51] members questions and then i'm gonna [13:53] jump to the first few questions that [13:54] were asked [13:55] within this live video so the first [13:58] question is my once dog reactive german [14:00] shepherd is used to my friend's dog [14:03] seven-year-old somewhat submissive [14:04] female they've walked together many [14:06] times on leash and sometimes she's off [14:08] leash walking around while he's on leash [14:11] the last time we met i put him in a sit [14:13] and was petting her hello they were [14:15] saying hello nose to nose when suddenly [14:18] he growled and lunged at her not sure if [14:20] he was feeding off my energy but is [14:22] there any reason why he would do this [14:24] other than being an a-hole [14:26] i corrected him [14:27] okay any advice [14:29] when we're working with a dog that used [14:31] to be reactive even if they've been [14:33] around other dogs it's always good to be [14:35] watching the body language so something [14:37] that [14:38] i recommend to avoid doing is allowing [14:41] dogs to say hello muzzle to muzzle that [14:43] can sometimes even with the dogs that [14:45] are not reactive or aggressive towards [14:47] other dogs just being in that position [14:50] that posture can often trigger a dog [14:53] fight and you know what i'm talking [14:54] about you've seen it before if you've [14:56] gone to dog parks or you've been around [14:57] a bunch of dogs that are together they [14:59] get muzzle to muzzle and that triggers a [15:01] dog fight or they get muzzle to muzzle [15:03] and then one brings their head over the [15:05] back of the other dog's shoulder blades [15:07] that will also often trigger [15:10] an aggressive reaction and depending on [15:12] whether or not the other dog retaliates [15:13] then it could turn into a dogfight which [15:15] we definitely don't want so i would try [15:17] to avoid allowing the dogs to go muzzle [15:19] to muzzle and then the second thing is [15:24] well actually what what you did was [15:26] correct so you corrected him that's what [15:28] i would have done i would have corrected [15:29] him for doing that behavior letting him [15:32] know that's not okay we don't know [15:34] exactly why dogs do certain things we [15:37] can have an idea based on [15:40] the dog's body language i mean it's very [15:42] easy to tell if a dog is happy and wants [15:44] to be playful everybody knows the low [15:47] bow the butt up in the air the tail [15:49] wagging there are things that are very [15:50] easy to read but we don't necessarily [15:53] know the dog was angry because of this [15:55] the dog was fearful because of this the [15:58] dog was anxious because of this we don't [16:00] always know the because but we can often [16:02] read their body language and figure out [16:05] what's going to be the best course of [16:06] action to prevent something bad from [16:08] happening or of course encouraging the [16:09] dog to learn so i think the correction [16:11] was the right way to go that's what i [16:13] would have done i would have corrected [16:14] the dog and the next time try to make [16:16] sure that i'm preventing any sort of [16:18] possible behavior that could lead up to [16:20] that sort of incident that we're dealing [16:22] with [16:23] the next one is i'm interested in [16:25] becoming a professional dog trainer and [16:27] i looked into schools but i'm not in the [16:28] u.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 407/841,s i've seen your videos on the tom [16:31] rose school kennelwood academy et cetera [16:33] are there any such programs in europe [16:35] that you'd recommend [16:36] or you do you have any other tips on how [16:39] to go about for someone who's not in the [16:41] us [16:42] if you're not in the us of course i [16:44] don't know what other sort of dog [16:46] trainer schools there are [16:48] but europe if you're in europe [16:50] um [16:52] there are a lot of dog training clubs [16:56] and competitions that take place in [16:59] europe uh schutzen you know that's that [17:02] was started in germany you have french [17:04] ring you have [17:05] all these different sports mondeo ring [17:06] psa that started in the united states [17:08] but you could probably find what my [17:10] biggest recommendation would be if you [17:12] cannot find a school or if you can't [17:15] find somebody to mentor under then look [17:19] for dog training clubs dog training [17:21] clubs is a great way to go you can find [17:23] a protection club you can find [17:25] strictly an obedience club and what's [17:27] really nice about dog training clubs [17:30] often the members in the club are [17:32] professional dog trainers and since [17:34] you're working together as a team the [17:36] club trains together and they compete [17:38] together they're more than happy to [17:40] teach you what they know guide you and [17:42] help you the best way they possibly can [17:44] so [17:45] going to a club hands down one of the [17:47] best ways to learn of course you can [17:49] learn online you have my videos or some [17:52] other really good dog trainer videos out [17:54] there you have learberg online [17:56] university which is great michael ellis [17:58] has a bunch of great videos online so [18:00] learning online and then putting in a [18:02] time and practicing of course you're not [18:04] going to be a pro by just training your [18:06] own dog but going and volunteering at a [18:08] local rescue a local shelter those are [18:11] also really great ways to learn and work [18:13] with multiple dogs with different [18:14] personalities and behavioral and [18:16] training issues that is going to [18:18] increase your [18:19] understanding and your frame of [18:21] reference so you can handle taking on [18:23] clients and training them at a level [18:25] that you would consider [18:28] that that you would be happy with if [18:30] someone was to train your dog for you so [18:31] reaching up to that exceptional level so [18:34] that would be my recommendation [18:36] my puppy doesn't like to go downstairs [18:38] she clearly is happy to go outside yet [18:41] when i go to pick her up she scoots away [18:43] goes across the room sits and makes me [18:45] come to her side of the room to fetch [18:47] her it could be that she wiggled out of [18:50] my grasp while on the stair glide and [18:52] broke her paw she may be associating the [18:55] stair glide to the injury any suggestion [18:58] yes dogs can associate a bad experience [19:02] to something that didn't even [19:03] specifically cause the issue so if your [19:06] dog did fall off of the stair glide and [19:08] hurt her par injured her paw then yes [19:11] that could be creating fear i talk about [19:13] this often when dealing with fear-based [19:16] fear based behaviors or issues and if [19:19] you're watching this you probably [19:20] already know what i'm going to say [19:21] counter conditioning and desensitization [19:23] with something like this i would also [19:25] work on leash pressure i want to make [19:27] sure with leash pressure so what is the [19:29] big difference between using positive [19:31] reinforcement and using leash pressure [19:34] well positive reinforcement [19:36] let me rephrase that what's the [19:37] difference between using just positive [19:40] reinforcement in comparison to using [19:42] negative reinforcement with positive [19:44] reinforcement well [19:45] positive reinforcement is limited by how [19:48] much the dog wants the reward that we're [19:50] offering [19:50] using the combination of negative [19:52] reinforcement and positive reinforcement [19:55] reduces the dog's option of choice it [19:57] says doesn't matter whether or not you [19:59] want to do this behavior you have to [20:01] comply now i'm still going to behave i'm [20:03] still going to reward you but you have [20:05] to do this behavior so what i'll do with [20:07] something like that first i'm gonna i'm [20:09] gonna expose the dog to this i'm not [20:11] going to avoid it and i'm not going to [20:13] wait till i'm just getting ready to take [20:15] the dog down the stairs when i don't [20:16] have a leash or collar or any way to [20:18] reinforce expectations [20:20] remember when we want our dogs to act [20:22] and perform a certain way in a specific [20:24] situation we need to rehearse that with [20:26] our dogs and treat it as a training [20:29] process for anything we want our dogs to [20:31] do successfully well so it's something [20:33] like that i might start working on a [20:34] recall upstairs getting closer and [20:36] closer to the stairs but not necessarily [20:38] to the stairs right away we have to read [20:40] our dog and make sure we're not [20:42] overwhelming the dog during the training [20:44] process [20:45] but then if you do give a command let's [20:47] say you're doing a recall command and [20:49] you're a little closer to the stairs and [20:50] she doesn't want to come over use the [20:52] leash pressure cue the dog now you might [20:54] walk towards her a little bit but you [20:56] still want to make sure you accomplish [20:57] that recall command so she doesn't [20:59] become situational and think okay in [21:01] this situation i don't have to listen to [21:04] you it's been proven multiple times so [21:06] when you call me i'm going to scoop back [21:08] in the corner make you come pick me up [21:10] so have it ready put the dog in the [21:11] situation and have the tools to [21:14] go through that training process [21:15] correctly [21:18] what i would also do is i would start [21:20] having the dog go down the stairs [21:22] starting on the bottom step so i would [21:25] go to the bottom i'd put the dog on the [21:27] very bottom step and i would call her [21:28] off that step then i would go to the [21:30] second i would do the same thing third [21:32] fourth sixth seventh all the way until [21:34] i'm having the dog go down from the very [21:36] top of the stairs that's going to help [21:38] her become more comfortable with it as [21:40] well and starting at the bottom is going [21:42] to make the process seem much smoother [21:45] you're going to be surprised at how [21:46] quickly your dog will become comfortable [21:48] going down the stairs when you start on [21:50] the bottom step and gradually work your [21:53] way up and so what i mean is you're [21:54] placing your dog on one step cueing him [21:57] down placing him on the second cueing [21:59] her down placing her on the third cueing [22:00] her down if she's comfortable to walk up [22:02] do that as well but start at the bottom [22:04] work your way up and back down [22:06] is it okay to let other people command [22:08] tricks that i've taught my dog they [22:10] often have bad timing but they do enjoy [22:12] commanding the tricks and i see how they [22:14] feel when the dog does something that [22:16] they ask for will this delay my [22:18] conditioning [22:19] there's different [22:21] okay so there are different people that [22:23] think differently about this when i was [22:25] first learning how to train dogs i was [22:27] told don't let anyone give your dog any [22:29] commands [22:30] if you leave for a weekend and somebody [22:33] is watching your dog and they're giving [22:34] your dog all sorts of commands and [22:36] they're not reinforcing it then the dog [22:38] is going to ignore you once you get back [22:41] because they've [22:42] in a sense [22:44] reconditioned the dog to not obey or not [22:47] listen to commands and it just undues [22:50] all your training [22:51] from my experience it really does depend [22:53] on the dog and how well they are [22:56] generalized to the training that's one [22:58] or if you've only trained your dog and [23:00] your dog knows that you have certain [23:02] rules and expectations what they might [23:05] do in the beginning if they've been [23:07] getting commands from other people and [23:09] their timings not correct and it's not [23:11] reinforcing the way that [23:13] you would like them to reinforce these [23:15] behaviors [23:16] then it could slow it down a little bit [23:19] i haven't seen [23:21] it to a point where it's it's it's so [23:24] dramatic that it's almost like reversing [23:26] the training but yeah it can delay it a [23:29] little bit it can delay it a little bit [23:30] but i don't think it's going to be so [23:32] bad that it ruins the training and if [23:34] you notice that it is starting to make [23:37] your dog slow down in the training [23:38] process then give it a break for a [23:41] little while don't have other people [23:42] work with your dog or give them tricks [23:44] and then when you feel like your dog is [23:45] performing better and and the timing's [23:47] really nice usually what i'll do if i'm [23:49] having somebody give my dog couple [23:51] commands if they want to ask her to go [23:53] on the heel or they want to have the dog [23:55] do a spin or something goofy i'll give [23:57] them some treats i'll let i'll have them [23:59] show the dog like that they have the [24:01] treats because why is a dog going to do [24:03] a behavior for somebody that's not their [24:04] owner well to get access to a reward of [24:06] course that's what we want our dogs to [24:08] do for us but we also want our dogs to [24:10] do commands even when they don't have [24:12] access to a reward right away [24:14] so once they show the dog that they have [24:16] the reward then i have them give the dog [24:18] the command often i will do it first and [24:21] i will tell them pay attention to the [24:23] way that i'm giving my dog the command [24:25] pay attention to the rise and inflection [24:27] of my voice the way i say sit sit [24:31] down heel i make it a very specific [24:34] noise so it's clear and easy for the dog [24:36] to understand if somebody tries to give [24:38] my dog a command and they're not [24:41] coming close to the way i say it then [24:43] often the dog might do a different [24:45] behavior so that's another part and then [24:47] when your dog does the behavior you can [24:49] mark it and they can give the dog the [24:51] reward so you could tell them once i say [24:54] this word whatever your marker is then [24:56] go ahead and give my dog the reward so [24:58] they give the command the dog does the [25:00] behavior you mark the behavior they give [25:03] the dog the reward and that's going to [25:04] reduce any of the likelihood of it [25:07] slowing down or delaying your training [25:10] all right my dog is aggressive to my [25:12] other dog and when he look when he's [25:14] looking at her i will say his name and [25:16] when he looks at me i'm marking reward [25:18] and other times when he's looking at her [25:20] i will just mark and he will look at me [25:23] so is it possible that i could be [25:25] marking the wrong thing since i don't [25:27] know what he's thinking all right so the [25:29] exercise that you're doing [25:31] is a common exercise that is used for [25:34] dogs that might be slightly reactive to [25:36] other dogs while on a walk so you're [25:38] walking your dog the dog looks at [25:40] another dog you get your dog's attention [25:42] your dog looks at you you mark that [25:44] behavior and reward so you mark your dog [25:46] looking at you [25:47] what that does is it teaches the dog [25:49] okay anytime we're on a walk find [25:52] another dog like identify the other dog [25:54] look for another dog once you spot [25:55] another dog look at me [25:58] and i will pay you for that so it [26:00] doesn't teach the dogs not to look at [26:02] other dogs but what it does do is it [26:03] teaches them to look for other dogs [26:05] identify them then look at the handler [26:07] in order to get a payment in order to [26:09] get a reward and it does start to create [26:12] a positive association this is a little [26:13] bit different because it's your own two [26:15] dogs so when he's looking at her and you [26:18] say his name he could start to learn [26:20] that looking at her is going to make you [26:22] say his name which is going to make him [26:24] look at you and you're going to reward [26:25] him so very similar to the walk [26:28] you definitely don't want to be marking [26:30] with a [26:31] continuation or terminal marker while [26:33] he's looking at the other dog because [26:35] dogs are thinking about what they're [26:37] looking at and if you're doing that then [26:38] you are rewarding him for looking at her [26:41] so just figure out what behaviors you [26:44] want him to perform when he's around [26:45] your other dog and start marking those [26:48] behaviors if looking at her ends up [26:51] causing other issues which often can [26:54] happen the dog stares at the other dog [26:56] and then eventually that might turn into [26:57] a dog fight or the dog runs after the [26:59] other dog barking in an aggressive [27:01] manner if you start to notice certain [27:03] behaviors are a predictor of other [27:06] behaviors you don't like then redirect [27:08] it to something different so what i [27:10] would do when he starts to look at her i [27:12] would be i would [27:14] use that as my cue to give him the climb [27:17] command so the moment he does that i'd [27:19] go climb and i'd take him and put him on [27:21] the climb platform or i would do [27:23] something else to redirect that behavior [27:25] so i wouldn't allow him to just stare [27:27] because that can often cause issues but [27:29] yeah you could be correct you could be [27:31] actually rewarding him for doing a [27:33] behavior you don't like in that [27:34] situation so reward the behavior that [27:36] you do like and then if he does do [27:39] something that you don't like i would [27:41] correct i would correct the behavior let [27:43] them know that that's not an okay [27:45] behavior okay so now we're gonna jump to [27:47] that was all the member questions that [27:49] we had so now i'm gonna [27:51] jump in and see what questions we have [27:54] so far so first one [27:56] how best to address excessive barking [27:58] barking at vacuum people walking by [28:01] watermelons etc etc [28:03] excuse me we don't want to discourage [28:05] her protective nature through these [28:06] corrections okay so this is something i [28:09] talked about last time first you want to [28:11] know why your dog is barking so if we're [28:13] thinking about a vacuum what i do with [28:15] dogs that are uncomfortable that with [28:17] the vacuums or [28:19] people walking by or watermelons all [28:21] these different things is telling me [28:23] more likely than not that your dog is [28:25] unsure of what these things are and as a [28:30] response to it she starts to bark i [28:32] think it's a she [28:36] yeah she [28:37] uh discouraged her protective nature [28:39] through these corrections or protective [28:41] nature sorry more often more likely than [28:43] not it's not protective it's lack of [28:45] confidence [28:46] it's probably some anxiety associated [28:49] with that [28:50] so i would go back to counter [28:52] conditioning and desensitization with [28:54] vacuums what i like to do with dogs with [28:55] vacuums is i take the part i take the [28:58] vacuum apart as much as i possibly can i [29:01] introduce a piece to the dog i mark and [29:03] reward i put that piece away i get the [29:05] next piece mark and reward i get the dog [29:07] comfortable with each piece separately [29:10] and then i bring one piece and then i [29:11] bring another piece and i take one away [29:13] i bring another one so i start rotating [29:15] them through so now there's two pieces [29:16] and then three pieces four five six [29:18] seven eventually until i have all the [29:20] pieces then i start putting it together [29:22] i reward the dog put the next piece [29:23] together reward the dog put the next [29:25] piece together reward the dog until the [29:27] vacuum is completely assembled then i [29:29] turn on the vacuum turn it off reward [29:31] the dog turn on the vacuum turn it off [29:33] reward the dog i might move the vacuum [29:35] without turning it on mark and reward [29:37] then i'll turn it on move turn it off [29:39] mark and reward so you're getting your [29:40] dog comfortable and [29:43] giving your dog an opportunity in a [29:45] sense to learn what the vacuum is so [29:47] that's going to be part of that [29:49] desensitization and counter conditioning [29:51] same thing with people walking by what i [29:53] like to do with dogs that are [29:54] uncomfortable or they bark at people [29:57] walking by i go to an area where there's [29:59] a good amount of traffic [30:01] but i go far enough away where my dog is [30:04] not having any of those negative [30:05] reactions or the dog that i'm working [30:07] with is not having any of those negative [30:09] reactions then i'm rewarding the dog i'm [30:11] training i'm creating a strong positive [30:13] association now if you want to stop the [30:15] barking so the reason why i went over [30:17] all that is because you want to make [30:18] sure that these behaviors are not based [30:21] on fear if the behaviors are based on [30:23] fear and you correct your dog it could [30:26] make the fear worse it's like a [30:28] self-fulfilling prophecy [30:30] if it's not based on fear then you could [30:33] start teaching a quiet command i talked [30:35] about this on the last live q a that i [30:37] did quite command is very easy to teach [30:39] if you do it this way i've seen other [30:42] techniques when it comes to teaching a [30:44] quiet command online and they just are [30:47] not as [30:48] effective as a technique i'm about to [30:50] say right now [30:52] our no or our word that predicts a leash [30:56] pop or a correction [30:57] that's a condition punisher it's what [31:00] it's called a condition punisher it's [31:02] been conditioned to predict a punishment [31:05] so if you say no and then you correct [31:08] your dog no is a conditioned punisher [31:10] just like yes predicts a reward so yes [31:14] is a condition reinforcer [31:17] i treat the word quiet or the command [31:20] quiet the same way that i do as a [31:22] conditioned correction i tell the dog [31:25] quiet once they bark they bark i go [31:26] quiet and i give them a correction the [31:29] moment they're quiet good nice job so [31:32] now you might be asking yourself well if [31:34] this is the same as a condition [31:36] correction then why don't we just keep [31:37] using the established no marker that [31:40] we've been using as the condition [31:42] correction [31:43] these two sounds are the same in the [31:45] very beginning however once the dog [31:48] starts to respond [31:50] to the quiet command meaning you say [31:52] quiet and your dog instantly goes quiet [31:54] without you having to give your dog a [31:55] correction now your dog knows the [31:57] command and no longer needs the [31:59] correction so now it is a condition or [32:04] it's no longer being treated as a [32:05] condition correction now it's being [32:07] treated as a command [32:10] the condition correction our no always [32:12] predicts a correction so that's going to [32:14] be the difference between the two [32:16] a good example is what's the difference [32:18] between the come command and a terminal [32:21] marker because if you see me teaching [32:22] the count command i go come and then i [32:24] move back i drop my hand down i [32:26] encourage the dog to come to me i lift [32:28] up they sit i use a marker and i reward [32:30] the behavior when i am teaching the [32:32] terminal marker i say free and then i [32:34] move back i drop my hand down encourage [32:36] the dog come to me to get the reward the [32:38] terminal marker always predicts the [32:39] reward come is a command they have to [32:41] come and comply and in the beginning it [32:44] always predicts a reward just like we're [32:46] teaching any new command we always [32:49] use continual reinforcement in the [32:51] beginning until the dog knows the [32:52] command then we start to space out the [32:54] rewards alright [32:56] let's see what's next [32:58] um [33:00] waking dog training i'm not sure what [33:02] that is question i already taught the [33:04] dog multiple tricks sit down here paw [33:07] climb off center jump heel spin crawl [33:09] without markers how to teach markers [33:11] without breaking damaging the relation [33:14] with my dog [33:15] well markers are it depends on the type [33:18] of marker that you are teaching [33:20] by definition in order for a word or [33:22] sound to be a marker it must predict one [33:25] of the four quadrants of opera [33:26] conditioning positive or negative [33:27] reinforcement positive or negative [33:29] punishment [33:30] teaching behaviors without markers is [33:32] very possible [33:34] because when we are teaching commands [33:36] we're right next to the dog if i'm on [33:39] step two of my training where i'm luring [33:41] my dog into all the different positions [33:43] if i lift up to lure my dog into a sit [33:45] and the dog's right in front of me the [33:47] moment the dog's butt hits the ground i [33:49] can give that dog a piece of food [33:51] connecting the behavior to the reward [33:53] our markers really come in handy when we [33:56] don't have [33:57] the [33:58] we don't have enough or i'm sorry let me [34:00] rephrase that the mark the markers come [34:02] in handy when we are unable to get the [34:04] primary reinforcer to the to the dog [34:07] within a second of them doing the [34:08] behavior we're trying to capture if i'm [34:10] luring a dog it's very easy but once i [34:12] start giving a dog commands from a [34:14] distance now using markers become very [34:18] valuable because i can't get the primary [34:20] to the dog within a second of them doing [34:22] the behavior anymore also markers help [34:24] us pinpoint very fine details within our [34:27] training michael ellis has a great [34:28] example of this with the dog healing [34:30] looking up if he just rewards the dog [34:33] and the dog drops her head and gets the [34:34] reward he's rewarding the dog for doing [34:36] the exact opposite behavior of what he [34:38] actually wants but if the dog is looking [34:40] up at [34:42] the handler and the handler marks well [34:45] now we're marking the behavior of the [34:47] dog looking at us so markers do come in [34:49] handy now to answer that question i [34:52] would just start with the engagement [34:54] training doing the engagement training [34:56] it doesn't matter how much training the [34:58] dog has had [34:59] dogs love engagement training it's fun [35:02] it's engaging they're getting paid for [35:04] almost doing nothing at all simply [35:05] looking up at us just make sure your [35:07] timing is correct and then you can start [35:09] incorporating those markers into the [35:10] training and then doing step three in my [35:14] manual or on my videos which is teaching [35:16] the dog leash pressure which again [35:18] should really be called a leash cube [35:20] because we are teaching the dog to go [35:22] with the pressure not to resist [35:24] i like to use my leash pressure training [35:27] as a marker as well so i use the word [35:30] wrong so if i tell a dog that i'm [35:31] training wrong that means i'm going to [35:33] take the leash and i'm going to show [35:34] them what i want them to do [35:36] with the leash pressure cue we've [35:38] already established and it becomes very [35:41] transferable because the more we use it [35:43] what it ends up meaning to the dog is [35:45] stop what you're doing or go back to the [35:47] previous position dog breaks the climb [35:49] wrong we put the dog back on the climb [35:51] dog breaks a down state wrong we put the [35:53] dog back into the down stay [35:55] the dog goes in and unrestrict or sorry [35:57] the dog goes in a restricted room wrong [35:59] we use a leash we cue the dog out of the [36:01] room the dog jumps on a piece of [36:02] furniture they're not supposed to be on [36:04] wrong we use the leash to queue also the [36:06] wrong becoming it can become a very [36:09] useful tool it's also good to reinforce [36:11] commands in the very beginning when the [36:12] dog is still new to the training and if [36:15] they choose not to do it if you tell [36:16] them sitting there like i don't feel [36:17] like doing it right now and they don't [36:19] realize that they have to then you can [36:21] say wrong use a leash cue the dog into [36:23] the sit good dog so they start to [36:25] understand and then you can transfer [36:26] that over to correction in order to get [36:28] reliability [36:30] how do i make my dog stop cleaning my [36:32] kitchen [36:33] he's not very good at it i just want him [36:35] to stop now i feel like [36:37] that's funny uh that would be really [36:40] cool if you could teach your dog to [36:41] clean your kitchen [36:42] okay [36:43] rescue an abused dog how best to [36:45] socialize a pup who's afraid of his own [36:47] shadow [36:48] all right that is a tough one [36:50] if you have a group or if you have [36:53] somebody who perhaps so [36:55] i'll give you an example i would help [36:57] dogs that had fear issues like that when [37:00] i would have a bunch of dogs so it used [37:03] to be that i would have anywhere from 10 [37:05] to 15 dogs on average at my house [37:08] and if i had six dogs i knew were really [37:11] friendly really sweet bunch of puppies [37:13] or something like that it's going to be [37:15] very easy to socialize that dog now the [37:17] dog's going to be afraid at the very [37:19] beginning but once a dog realizes that [37:21] these dogs are not aggressive they're [37:24] not a threat they do quickly come over [37:26] that fear i had a german shepherd dog [37:28] that i was training once i went to the [37:30] house to meet the dog meet the owners [37:33] and the owners at the very beginning [37:34] told me right away like oh our dog is [37:36] very protective it was a young puppy and [37:38] once i saw the dog's behavior i said [37:40] that's not protection that's fear your [37:41] dog is afraid [37:43] and when i took the dog back to the [37:44] house part of the socializing process [37:46] with the training i started letting out [37:48] the dogs one by one and these were all [37:50] young [37:51] happy-go-lucky very friendly dogs and [37:54] the german shepherd that i was working [37:55] with ran and hid in a corner and just [37:57] sat there the other dogs went up [37:59] investigated sniffed them and then by a [38:02] day or two [38:03] she was completely fine being around [38:05] these new dogs it's about making sure we [38:07] expose [38:08] this dog to the right dogs you don't [38:11] want to have a dog that is already [38:13] fearful and then having a bad experience [38:14] and this is why i say this is a tough [38:16] situation [38:17] because you have those types of [38:18] resources or if you don't have enough [38:21] friends that have friendly dogs then it [38:24] can become very difficult you don't just [38:25] want to go to a dog park and hope for [38:27] the best [38:28] dog parks can be risky you can benefit [38:31] from going to a dog park but i just [38:32] don't think the risk is [38:35] i think the risk outweighs the benefits [38:36] so i don't take dogs to dog parks i mean [38:39] think about it how many of you have been [38:41] to a dog park where half the people [38:43] there are playing on their phone or [38:45] they're reading a book and they're not [38:46] even paying attention to their dog and [38:48] then something happens and then they're [38:50] surprised that something happened [38:51] because they weren't paying attention [38:52] they weren't reading the dog's body [38:54] language to make sure nothing would [38:55] happen so i don't like going to dog [38:57] parks because it could be a risk but if [38:59] you can find if you have friends if you [39:01] have family that have nice friendly dogs [39:03] puppies that's going to help and you [39:05] want to socialize the dog with them an [39:07] exercise that you can do and i've talked [39:09] about this quite a bit to get the dog [39:10] comfortable being around other dogs is [39:12] going to a dog park but not going into [39:14] the dog park you probably already heard [39:16] me say this before stay far enough away [39:18] that you're not getting a terrible [39:20] reaction [39:22] if you're too close your dog might start [39:24] responding with fear or barking or [39:26] cowering you want to be close enough [39:28] that your dog can see what's going on [39:30] but far enough away that you're not [39:31] getting a negative reaction and then [39:33] reward your dog play with your dog [39:35] create a strong positive association you [39:37] could also [39:39] this is a [39:41] i've talked about this before it's a [39:42] really good example of how i worked with [39:44] a very very fearful dog the dog was a [39:47] very sweet dog just incredibly fearful [39:50] anytime you took this dog out in public [39:52] the dog would shut down and be on high [39:55] alert just looking around worried about [39:57] everything [39:58] and what i did was i first started [40:00] working the dog in the backyard and then [40:02] i started working the dog in the front [40:04] yard in the front yard that was the only [40:06] location that the dog was able to eat [40:08] then a local park that was the only [40:09] location i would feed the dog then [40:11] eventually i was taking the dog to home [40:13] depot and it took a few days before the [40:16] dog would even eat at home depot i took [40:18] the dog to home depot i'm offering the [40:19] dog food and the dog was ignoring the [40:21] food because there's too much going [40:23] around and i also went on a day where [40:25] there wasn't that much traffic you [40:26] wouldn't want to take a dog that's [40:28] fearful or nervous or uncomfortable in [40:30] public and take them to home depot on a [40:33] saturday morning [40:35] when it's jam-packed with people that's [40:36] going to be too much so i went when [40:38] there was less traffic at a different [40:40] time different times in the day when [40:41] there's less traffic and i gradually [40:43] started to [40:45] increase i guess you could say the [40:46] difficulty of the environment by going [40:49] at times where it did become a little [40:51] bit busier depending on the day but [40:52] starting when it wasn't that busy and [40:54] then i kept going when it wasn't busy [40:56] until the dog was taking food from me [40:58] and started to do training in that [41:00] environment so each time i was able to [41:02] progress with the dog i would make the [41:04] environment a little bit more difficult [41:07] i do have a video on that generalizing [41:09] and socializing a dog and has a good way [41:11] of explaining what sort of commands and [41:13] what things you want to ask for from [41:15] your dog depending on the environment [41:17] and depending on the dog's proficiency [41:19] level within the training [41:22] all right let's see what's next [41:26] can i teach my future protection dog [41:28] okay nope you can't do that are you [41:30] going to make any more service dog [41:32] videos i probably will be right now i'm [41:35] just in a [41:37] difficult position for filming as many [41:39] you know just moved back to california [41:41] from north carolina since we've been [41:44] back this is the second airbnb that i've [41:46] been in i might end up having to go to [41:48] another airbnb [41:50] uh i have a little one on the way so [41:52] there's a lot of things going on [41:55] once everything is a little bit more [41:56] established then i'm gonna be doing more [41:58] videos with new dogs so i'm going to be [42:02] doing as many videos as i can based on [42:05] the situation so you'll probably start [42:07] seeing [42:08] a [42:09] uh [42:10] more dogs or a larger variety of dogs in [42:13] my videos once i'm established and set [42:15] back up in the house out here and [42:17] everything's kind of running smooth okay [42:21] all day with my dogs and they did [42:22] awesome that's great my pleasure [42:25] let's see [42:26] i'm teaching my pitbull to play center [42:28] field [42:29] i've not seen you teach catch [42:31] suggestions [42:32] uh catch [42:34] for a dog it's just about practicing of [42:36] course if you're trying to use you want [42:37] to use something that's easy for the dog [42:39] to catch but just practicing gives the [42:41] dog the ability to understand like if [42:43] you take a brand new dog or a puppy and [42:45] you try to throw a piece of food at that [42:47] dog the dog's not going to catch it they [42:49] just don't have the coordination for it [42:50] yet so it's just practicing it it's the [42:52] same with like teaching a dog frisbee [42:55] when i teach dogs frisbee i like to use [42:57] the the [42:58] light frisbees not the hard ones the [43:00] very light ones the ones that are made [43:02] out of fabric and then i throw it with a [43:04] really nice spin [43:06] to slow down the speed of the frisbee to [43:09] give the dog a little bit more time to [43:12] properly time it and catch it but just [43:16] practicing with them is what gets them [43:18] to do these things so like frisbee isn't [43:20] very hard to teach it just takes time it [43:22] takes going out and giving the dog a lot [43:24] of opportunities to develop the skill [43:27] set and get good at it and if the dog [43:28] enjoys playing fetch it becomes pretty [43:30] simple same thing with throwing food at [43:32] them [43:34] alright let's see what else do we have [43:39] if your dog is being aggressive due to [43:42] resource guarding and you need to get [43:44] what he has off him how can he do this [43:46] without being bit [43:47] all right i would recommend watching the [43:49] the resource guardian episode that i did [43:51] with bethany it's the same technique [43:53] that i like to use but you you have to [43:55] work with them [43:57] just like anything you have to work with [43:59] the dog you have to rehearse it so then [44:00] when the situation comes up so like this [44:02] you said you need to get what he has [44:04] away from him [44:06] well if i'm worried about the dog biting [44:08] me then i'm going to use leash pressure [44:10] i'm just going to use a leash that way i [44:12] can lift up so if you've seen my video [44:14] teaching a dog how to drop there's a few [44:16] ways we can teach a dog to drop an item [44:19] one is by using value transfer you have [44:22] two toys exactly the same the dog has [44:25] one toy you pull out the next toy hey [44:27] look what i have the dog releases the [44:29] old toy bites the new toy and you go [44:31] into play once you know you can get the [44:33] dog to drop the item every time you [44:35] present the new item then you put the [44:37] command on it so you would say drop it [44:39] then you bring the new toy out the dog [44:41] drops the old toy and you reinforce and [44:43] you play with the new toy [44:44] then once you know your dog will drop [44:47] the video every time you say drop it [44:49] then you reward them with the same toy [44:50] so you have the toy you tell them drop [44:52] it or out the dog releases you can use [44:54] your terminal marker and go right back [44:56] into play so we can teach with value [44:58] transfer another great technique though [45:00] is teaching with leash pressure you tell [45:02] the dog out you lift up on the leash the [45:04] moment the dog drops the item in their [45:06] mouth you turn off the pressure so [45:08] that's what i would do if i needed to [45:10] get something away from a dog and i'm [45:12] assuming by asking this question you're [45:14] talking about something that could be [45:16] harmful or potentially dangerous to the [45:19] dog that you have [45:21] teaching to drop it really helps also [45:24] getting them used to your hand coming [45:26] towards them when they have a resource [45:28] is going to help quite a bit as well [45:30] like i said watch the video that i did [45:32] with bethany if you type nate shomer [45:34] resource guarding the video will come up [45:36] and you'll see exactly what i'm talking [45:37] about [45:39] all right [45:41] i have a deaf dog okay so if you're [45:44] working with a deaf dog [45:46] then you can use different signals to [45:49] communicate with them dogs [45:52] are very good at body language they're [45:54] very good at scent or they're very good [45:56] at reading body language and they [45:58] obviously have a a really good nose much [46:00] better than ours [46:01] i've worked with a few deaf dogs before [46:03] and what i do for that is pretty much [46:05] the same thing i do with any other dog [46:08] now i worked with another trainer that [46:10] had a deaf dog and when she would mark [46:11] behaviors she would do it thumbs up so [46:14] the dog would do it she would do thumbs [46:15] up and then she would give the dog a [46:16] reward i tried it it seemed to help a [46:19] little bit but another thing is dogs [46:21] that at least from my experience the few [46:23] that i've worked with they end up being [46:26] more focused and more aware with their [46:27] nose and their eyes since their hearing [46:29] doesn't work so they look at us a lot [46:31] more and when they do that they're able [46:34] to pick up on our body language when [46:35] we're going to reward them so something [46:37] that's important to understand when it [46:39] comes to rewarding a dog or connecting a [46:41] behavior to the reward [46:43] all we have to do is make sure that the [46:46] dog knows [46:47] that the reward is coming to them [46:50] once they know that the rewards coming [46:52] to them then they made the connection so [46:55] if i ask a dog to sit and the moment the [46:57] dog sits and i start walking towards [46:59] them and they know me walking towards [47:01] them as i'm reaching for the treat means [47:03] i'm going to reward them once they [47:05] connect that action as it predicting the [47:07] reward then they made the connection [47:09] they know sitting got you to walk [47:11] towards me and reach into your bait bag [47:13] which means you're going to give me a [47:14] reward so connecting behavior with [47:17] reward the dog just has to know that the [47:19] reward is coming of course markers help [47:22] us with that because our dogs are not [47:24] always looking at us now another thing [47:26] that i would use with deaf dogs is [47:30] i would get a remote training collar [47:32] and i would use the vibrate so the [47:34] vibrate i would use as a pay attention [47:36] to me or a come when called [47:39] so pretty much most remote training not [47:42] most but [47:43] a lot of remote training collars come [47:45] with a vibrate option and that's a great [47:47] option for training a deaf dog because [47:49] you can get their attention with it it's [47:51] not a correction and of course you can [47:53] use the stem to correct as well you have [47:55] to make sure you teach them to be [47:56] directional before you do that so [47:58] there's a lot of different pieces when [48:00] we [48:00] put this together but that's going to [48:03] help quite a bit as well all right let's [48:04] see what's next [48:10] uh okay so i'm a member but maybe i got [48:12] the question in too late because you [48:14] didn't mention it to [48:15] ninth comment at the top of the members [48:17] post [48:18] okay let me look real quick [48:22] to see what it is [48:27] okay [48:32] all right let's see here we go [48:35] i have a question today about [48:37] recreate training i'm at the stage where [48:40] i fumble keys leave lock the door then [48:43] come back and treat if she's good okay [48:45] so you're getting the dog used to being [48:47] comfortable with the crate i do that [48:48] five times and can leave for 20.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 408/841,[48:51] i want to keep ending on a good note and [48:52] building [48:53] up alone skills i'm currently watching [48:56] full time on the camera while i'm away [48:58] please describe the steps as you've seen [49:01] it for extending this time every day at [49:03] 10 minutes or can i add bigger smaller [49:07] chunks follow up with the question so [49:09] one of the best ways when you guys are [49:10] asking questions the shorter the better [49:13] so sometimes the questions are so long [49:15] that just getting through it takes a few [49:17] minutes [49:18] uh okay follow-up question after being [49:21] able to be alone in the crate for hours [49:23] at a time when would you know [49:25] that you can begin testing staying at [49:27] home alone without the crate [49:29] okay so [49:30] i think you're asking about getting the [49:31] dog comfortable being in the crate and [49:33] then leaving the dog home alone without [49:35] being in the crate i don't leave a dog [49:38] home alone in in the house until i know [49:41] that they're good while i'm there so if [49:43] you're still having to so like let's [49:45] think about what's house training and [49:47] what's potty training well we use a [49:49] crate for those two reasons for potty [49:50] training and house training dogs don't [49:52] like to go to the bathroom where they [49:54] eat or where they sleep that's why we [49:56] put them in a crate that's just big [49:57] enough for them to stand up turn around [49:59] and lay down well what's house training [50:01] well house training is a dog knowing how [50:03] to properly behave within the house so [50:05] not getting into the trash not drinking [50:08] out of the toilet bowl not chewing up [50:10] furniture or ripping up carpet [50:12] these are things we don't want our dogs [50:14] to do if you're having to still [50:16] reinforce expectations while you're at [50:18] the house then your dog certainly is not [50:20] ready to be left at the house when [50:22] you're not there now using something [50:24] like a furbo camera definitely does help [50:27] and [50:28] furbo is great i have a video on it i [50:31] like the furbo i use it [50:34] that's going to help you at least watch [50:35] when they're not there but even when i'm [50:37] training a dog and i'm leaving the house [50:38] and i want to make sure that they're [50:39] okay when i'm not there i'll have the [50:41] furbo set up or a baby cam whatever you [50:44] want to be able to see you can even [50:45] facetime another phone i act like i'm [50:47] leaving and then i watch the dogs to [50:50] make sure they're not doing anything [50:51] that i don't want them to do a good way [50:53] to build up to this is by doing [50:55] commanded stays while you're not in the [50:58] room so placing your dog on a down [51:00] let's say a climb stay is a good one [51:02] it's a very easy command you put the dog [51:04] on the climb stay you make sure the [51:05] camera is facing the dog you leave the [51:08] moment your dog breaks the climb stay [51:10] you walk in no or wherever you are in [51:12] the training and you reinforce the rules [51:14] and the expectations [51:16] then you leave again so now the dog is [51:19] starting to understand because by [51:20] setting the dog up in a sense what we're [51:22] doing here is we're setting the dog up [51:23] to fail [51:24] most dogs even if they have a really [51:26] solid stay command [51:28] the moment we leave the room they go i [51:30] don't have to do this anymore and they [51:32] break the position so we're setting them [51:34] up to fill we're showing them look when [51:36] i'm not here [51:38] if i walk out of the room i'm still [51:40] watching you so when the dog breaks it [51:42] again we go in and we reinforce it and [51:44] we do that enough times to where we can [51:46] leave and we can sit outside for 15 20 [51:49] 30 minutes and the dog stays on the [51:51] climb that entire time now you might be [51:53] saying yourself well 30 minutes 20 [51:55] minutes that seems like a very long time [51:58] it may seem like a long time grab a book [52:02] watch a youtube video do something it's [52:04] not that difficult to pass 20 minutes [52:07] and then the crate it's just duration if [52:09] the dog is making noise in the crate i [52:11] talked about this before we start by [52:13] putting a blanket over it if the blanket [52:14] doesn't work the bowl technique works [52:16] very nice and we can teach them to be [52:18] quiet when i start giving a dog more [52:20] freedom inside of the house as well i [52:22] start with sections of the house so we [52:24] don't give them the entire full access [52:26] of the house maybe the dog will stay in [52:28] where their crate is just in that room [52:30] but now they're not in the crate they [52:32] can go in and out of the crate and hang [52:33] on the rest of the room if the dog is [52:35] good with that short time window we can [52:37] increase the time and then we can start [52:39] adding more rooms for the dog to have [52:41] access to or the living room the kitchen [52:44] whatever works but we want to gradually [52:45] build it up [52:47] all right let's see what's next [52:58] okay i have a seven month german [53:00] shepherd husky lab he eats his poo [53:02] occasionally any suggestions if you have [53:05] a dog that has [53:06] if we look at behavioral issues [53:08] and you probably already know what the [53:10] five are aggressive fearful destructive [53:13] dangerous or behaviors we don't want the [53:15] dog to perform [53:16] this falls under dangerous i would say i [53:20] don't think i mean dogs can handle [53:22] eating their own feces but [53:24] it's definitely not good for them [53:27] their stomachs are way more resilient [53:29] than ours are but nonetheless that could [53:31] cause issues we don't want them to do it [53:33] it's obviously not sanitary i correct it [53:36] right away [53:38] now i have remote training collars so i [53:40] would use a remote training collar i'd [53:42] put the collar on the dog i'd send them [53:44] in the yard where i know the dog's going [53:45] to go try to eat some poo the moment the [53:48] dog does that i'm going to stimulate the [53:50] collar and then i get to be the good guy [53:52] i go what happened buddy [53:54] did that poo bite you probably shouldn't [53:56] be doing that and now the dog has a [53:58] negative association to doing that [54:01] behavior that we don't want the dog to [54:03] perform if you don't have a remote [54:05] collar then you want to correct it so [54:06] that's a behavior i'm going to correct [54:08] right away because it falls under the [54:10] potentially dangerous behavior and we [54:13] don't want our dogs practicing any [54:14] behaviors that could be dangerous [54:17] let's see [54:19] after listening to you talk about wrong [54:21] am i in the wrong my german shepherd [54:22] understands not very well [54:25] i also been using it after giving a [54:26] command that he ignores [54:28] i use so the the marker wrong that [54:31] predicts leash pressure i use it when i [54:33] first start teaching a stay so these are [54:35] all the different examples or different [54:37] situations in which i'll use [54:39] wrong which is my predictor for negative [54:42] reinforcement now more often than not [54:44] when i'm using negative reinforcement on [54:46] a dog it's with leash pressure but there [54:49] are different forms of negative [54:50] reinforcement in fact if your dog breaks [54:53] a stay and you start walking towards [54:55] your dog [54:56] your dog goes uh and goes back onto the [54:58] stay position that in a sense was [55:01] negative reinforcement you walking [55:03] towards the dog was the pressure the [55:04] moment the dog complied you turn the [55:06] pressure off by backing away so i use [55:09] wrong as a predictor for negative [55:10] reinforcement again more often than not [55:12] it's going to be leash pressure so i use [55:14] it when i'm teaching the stay [55:17] i'll use it when i'm [55:18] creating boundaries whether it's [55:21] invisible boundaries [55:22] going into a room i don't want the dog [55:24] to go into [55:25] jumping up on furniture that i don't [55:27] want the dog to jump up on jumping up on [55:29] people [55:31] maybe jumping out of the car door before [55:33] i release the dog which that would in a [55:34] sense fall under the stay [55:36] and then also when i first start giving [55:39] dogs [55:40] the command without the help of the [55:41] physical cue i might reinforce with [55:44] leash pressure if the dog needs it [55:48] when i'm teaching a dog command [55:51] when we're looking at obedience we have [55:53] two issues that fall under obedience a [55:55] dog not doing something we ask them to [55:57] do and a dog not staying in a state [56:00] i continue to use the leash pressure on [56:02] the stay until i know the dog knows the [56:05] state when i know the dog knows to stay [56:07] or at least i believe the dog knows to [56:09] stay based on their body language when [56:11] i'm doing the exercise or when i say [56:13] wrong they quickly go back to this day [56:15] then i transfer over to the no so the no [56:18] predicts positive punishment so after [56:20] i've taught the dog the commanding [56:22] position and i know they know the stay [56:23] from the leash pressure then i transfer [56:26] it over with the leash pop so then the [56:28] next time the dog breaks a stay instead [56:30] of saying wrong i say no i give the dog [56:32] a correction i recommend what i want the [56:34] dog to do and then i assist them with [56:36] the leash if needed so it's always no [56:38] correction recommand assist that makes [56:41] it easy if i always know when i start [56:43] using no it's no correction recommand [56:45] assist then i always know what to do and [56:47] i don't start that until i know the dog [56:49] knows it with commands [56:52] once i start giving the dog the commands [56:54] and they're doing it without the help of [56:55] the physical cue so i say down and the [56:58] dog lays down without me having to lure [57:00] or without me having to use the leash [57:01] pressure i want the dog to be roughly at [57:04] about 80 success rate before i start [57:07] correcting and i also want to see that [57:09] the dog is trying to do what i'm asking [57:11] them to do [57:12] me personally i never correct for [57:15] mistakes [57:16] now i'm not going to reward a dog if [57:19] they're not doing what i'm asking them [57:20] to do and if i notice they keep doing [57:22] the wrong thing over and over again then [57:25] i'm going to assist with leash pressure [57:26] i'm going to make sure they do it right [57:28] a good example would be you're telling [57:30] your dog to sit and instead of sitting [57:32] your dog is spinning or your dog is [57:34] going in the center your dog is doing [57:36] the behave a different behavior than [57:38] what you're asking them to perform [57:40] i'm not going to reward them for doing [57:42] it now i'm also not going to correct [57:44] them we have two options we can use a [57:46] non-reinforcement marker so that's a [57:48] word or sound that lets the dog know [57:49] they did not do the behavior correctly [57:52] but you're going to recommand and give [57:53] them another opportunity [57:55] or we can say nothing at all so you say [57:58] sit and the dog spins [58:00] just look at the dog [58:01] sit the dog sits and then we reward the [58:04] dog [58:05] if i say sit and the dog spins again [58:08] okay the dog needs help sit and i'm [58:09] going to use the leash and the reason [58:11] why i say i'm going to use a leash [58:13] because that's going to prevent them [58:14] from just spinning and not paying [58:15] attention to what i'm asking them to do [58:21] trying to see where else that was going [58:22] with that [58:23] okay so we give the command um [58:27] and you don't want to reward it again [58:29] like i was saying because if you give a [58:30] command and the dog does something [58:32] different and we reward them so [58:33] something that also comes up with this [58:35] is people say well i thought you said [58:37] not to recommand something when we're [58:39] looking at commands something has to [58:41] take place after the command in order [58:44] for us to recommand so what i mean by [58:45] that is if you say sit and your dog does [58:48] a spin well something happened [58:50] it was the incorrect behavior but [58:52] something happened now what you wouldn't [58:54] want is you wouldn't want to say sit and [58:56] the dog looks at you and goes i'm not [58:57] doing it [58:59] now nothing has happened the dog didn't [59:00] attempt to do it we didn't say wrong we [59:03] didn't say no so you wouldn't want to [59:04] say sit again in that situation you [59:07] would say sit sit sit you wouldn't want [59:09] to do that [59:10] so if you say sit and the dog does [59:12] nothing [59:13] you can say wrong and you can use the [59:15] leash and you can make the dog sit [59:17] or you can say no correction sit and [59:21] then assist them if needed i like to use [59:24] the corrections as i said once the dog [59:26] is at about 80 success percent 80 [59:29] success rate [59:31] okay let's see what else we have [59:34] uh thanks bk i appreciate that [59:38] glad to know you're back would love to [59:39] meet up and do some training for sure [59:43] practice yep practice how do i teach my [59:45] 17 month old german shepherd dog to [59:47] entertain herself while i work from home [59:51] that's that's going to be depending on [59:52] the dog you know um [59:54] my dog for example ari she likes to [59:57] suckle on her blanket [60:00] and that keeps her entertained [60:08] you can they have these different [60:10] puzzles that you can do so they have [60:11] puzzles for dogs bones bully sticks [60:15] that that's i mean a tough question a [60:17] lot of times dogs will learn to [60:19] entertain themselves [60:21] and if they don't learn how to entertain [60:22] themselves then you could try to give [60:24] them different things so i would just do [60:25] some research on google and see what [60:27] sort of things you can get that could [60:29] possibly provide some sort of [60:30] entertainment for your dog [60:32] okay let's see what else we have [60:36] uh thanks again bk awesome videos as [60:39] always love these new live q and a's i [60:41] hope these live q as are helpful i enjoy [60:43] doing them i love talking dogs [60:46] is there a big dog breed that is not so [60:48] energetic that one needs to be taken for [60:51] super long walks yet can handle tropical [60:54] climate and hopefully can serve as a [60:56] guard dog [60:58] how big are you thinking i mean [61:01] most dogs can handle different climates [61:03] as long as they have a place to cool [61:06] down if needed when looking at our dogs [61:09] a good indicator if they're too hot or [61:11] too tired is the size of their tongue so [61:14] whatever dog you are looking into i [61:16] would be more concerned about finding a [61:18] dog that's going to fit the specific [61:20] needs that i want that dog for [61:22] less active large dog [61:24] and that also comes down to the [61:26] individual dog [61:28] a doberman is obviously going to be way [61:30] more active than a saint bernard might [61:33] be [61:34] or a newfoundland although newfoundlands [61:37] can be pretty active too they were used [61:38] as rescue dogs for a long time and they [61:40] would actually pull in boats there's [61:42] some really cool history on the [61:44] newfoundland [61:49] let's see [61:51] why don't you show examples of positive [61:53] punishment in your v videos not many [61:56] freely available examples from good [61:57] trainers different levels for different [61:59] dogs in the content context of obedience [62:02] or quiet cue that's a good question and [62:05] it is something i'm going to be doing [62:07] but it's only going to be available for [62:09] channel members as i said i'm i'm in [62:11] this situation where i'm moving around [62:13] i'm trying to get [62:14] re-established and set back up here in [62:16] california and that's going to come once [62:19] i start doing stay in trains again i'm [62:20] gonna start doing staying trains [62:22] hopefully by [62:25] like november maybe december time frame [62:28] and when i start doing those stain [62:30] trains i'm gonna show the entire process [62:33] including corrections so flat collar [62:36] correction prong collar corrections [62:38] remote training collar corrections so [62:40] you can see how to do it the right way [62:41] and how we can get a dog to that [62:44] desired off leash status [62:47] but again that's only going to be [62:49] available for channel members and the [62:51] reason why is [62:53] as you already know [62:56] the internet can be a very hostile place [62:59] so i'm not going to be giving people [63:01] ammunition but for those that are [63:03] serious and they're willing to pay the [63:04] dollar 99 a month member fee it's going [63:07] to be available for channel members like [63:09] i said hopefully by november [63:12] what's your opinion on impact dog crates [63:14] they seem pretty good [63:16] a few of my friends have used them i [63:18] haven't used any of them but they do [63:19] seem like pretty good crates [63:25] my six-month-old [63:27] chefsky boy says thank you for your [63:29] videos [63:30] you're welcome it's my pleasure do you [63:32] do agility training i went down [63:35] the crux agility competition rabbit hole [63:38] and it was awesome [63:40] i have not competed in agility i've [63:42] probably trained [63:44] around eight dogs to do agility i have [63:47] some agility videos [63:49] agility if your dog enjoys doing agility [63:52] agility is one of those things that is [63:55] very easy to teach a dog [63:57] but it's very difficult to compete at a [64:00] high level [64:01] and i say that because i don't want to [64:03] discredit [64:05] agility competition trainers because [64:08] winning at the world level for agility [64:11] is by no means an easy or simple [64:14] accomplishment that is something very [64:16] difficult to do [64:17] because it's being able to get your dog [64:19] to not only of course be able to do all [64:21] the obstacles but do with speed and [64:24] precision and be able to beat everyone [64:25] else so [64:26] uh competing at the top level is very [64:28] difficult dogs love it so i think [64:30] agility is something really great it's [64:32] something it's a good thing to do to [64:34] bond with a dog so if you have a local [64:36] facility that offers agility training [64:38] you'd probably enjoy it and so would [64:40] your dog [64:43] your dog got fixed three days ago when [64:45] it was okay to start walking with him [64:46] again something like that i would [64:50] uh ask your veterinarian [64:52] see what they say usually it's like one [64:55] week or two weeks [64:56] i use the word wrong with my dog to keep [64:58] her out of her room when she is not [65:00] allowed in she's doing great okay that's [65:02] awesome my pleasure when are you getting [65:04] bethany on these videos uh we'll be [65:06] doing some more videos with bethany [65:08] hopefully within the next month or so [65:10] i've been talking with her and since i'm [65:13] back in california in fact i talked with [65:14] her a couple days ago through text [65:16] message so we're gonna be doing some [65:18] more training with uh bethany and her [65:20] team here real soon bethany is awesome [65:23] if you haven't seen her videos [65:24] definitely check them out on my channel [65:26] if you just type nate shoam or bethany [65:27] all her videos should come up and she is [65:29] quite the exceptional trainer [65:33] any tips on how to address when my dog [65:35] is being aggressive towards others [65:39] is pulling back on the leash bad is [65:41] blocking line of sight good is trying to [65:44] turn my dog around good [65:46] what i do if my dog starts to act [65:49] aggressive which ari will do it on [65:50] occasions she'll get an attitude and [65:53] i'll correct her i'll remind her no [65:54] that's not an okay behavior and remember [65:56] when we're using corrections the [65:58] corrections have to be adequate to the [66:00] dog's bank account as well as the [66:02] environment what i mean by that is some [66:04] dogs need higher corrections some dogs [66:07] are okay with a lower correction it's [66:10] going to depend on the dog's correction [66:11] level [66:12] some dogs need a correction let's say [66:16] a 25 on a remote collar zero to 100 is [66:19] gonna be more than enough while other [66:21] dogs might need a 35 some dogs are okay [66:24] on a five ten depends again on the dog [66:26] but i would correct that behavior [66:29] pulling back on the leash can sometimes [66:31] create more frustration but often we may [66:34] have to do that just to prevent the dog [66:36] from doing something we don't want [66:38] blocking the line of sight i'll do that [66:40] i'll block the line of sight that's not [66:42] a bad option and trying to turn your dog [66:44] around that could be fine as well but a [66:46] lot of times i want to stop that [66:48] behavior before it progresses and i'll [66:50] use a correction [66:52] all right let's see [66:56] someone you have the the spin [66:59] yeah that's a very common one i have the [67:00] spin instead of the sit type problem [67:02] also that happens dogs enjoy the spin [67:06] command [67:07] most dogs don't care for the sit the [67:09] sits boring there's nothing fun about it [67:12] so they hear that s and they go spin [67:14] that's what i'm doing sometimes it can [67:16] help using a different command instead [67:18] of the word spin just because spin and [67:20] sit can sound so similar to one another [67:23] tips to help dogs from confusing sit [67:26] with down and vice versa do you offer [67:28] down [67:29] with a one week stay in train [67:31] so with my stay in trains i used to do [67:34] two weeks minimum [67:36] when i start the stain trains again i'm [67:38] probably going to be doing either three [67:40] or four weeks stay in trains and i'm [67:42] only going to going to be doing one dog [67:44] at a time since i have a lot going on [67:46] plus [67:47] when i started to have [67:49] more than five dogs within a stay in [67:52] train and this was when i wasn't doing [67:53] youtube as often which youtube does take [67:55] a good amount of time [67:59] five was almost becoming too much [68:01] the more dogs you have if you're [68:03] training dogs [68:05] the quality starts to go down so i'm [68:06] gonna be doing one dog at a time and in [68:09] a staying train i teach sit down come [68:13] heel [68:14] spin [68:15] center climb [68:17] off [68:18] stay in all the commanded positions as [68:20] well as if requests that i do remote [68:23] collar training as well so after two [68:26] weeks to a month depending on what i'm [68:27] doing the dog will be off leash train [68:30] with the remote training collar [68:32] and we'll know sit down well spin i [68:35] teach the dog spin but that's not part [68:37] of the the guarantee [68:39] more of the the obedience the basic [68:41] obedience but i teach every dog spin and [68:43] center just because it's fun and it [68:45] makes the training more engaging and [68:46] interesting for the dog [68:48] all right let's see what else we have [68:58] how do you feel the best way to [68:59] transport a dog in a vehicle i like to [69:01] transport them in a crate or if you have [69:04] an area that's separated from the humans [69:07] and the dogs so for example the back of [69:10] my vehicle i have one of those [69:12] separators that separate my dogs from [69:14] the rest of the vehicle so they're back [69:16] there they're fine a crate is really [69:18] good if they're going to be in the back [69:20] seat and they're not in a crate then you [69:22] should have some way to buckle them in [69:24] so they have harnesses that you can hook [69:26] to a buckle and buckle the dog in so [69:28] they're safe and they're not going to [69:30] bounce around if you do happen to get [69:32] into a fender bender or an accident [69:35] how do you approach training a [69:40] let me see four month old [69:43] okay so you're you're looking at a dogo [69:45] um [69:48] four months okay [69:49] so dogs like to pull do hard weighted [69:52] tasks and pull more muscle so you're [69:53] trying to develop the muscle you want to [69:55] get your dog to start pulling more dogs [69:57] pull naturally so if you do reward them [69:59] for pulling they're going to continue to [70:01] pull i haven't specifically done that [70:03] type of training i have friends that [70:05] have and it really is just comes down to [70:08] rewarding them for pulling and as i said [70:10] dogs naturally pull they have that [70:12] classical opposition reflex so we pull [70:14] on the leash they pull in the opposite [70:16] direction so instead of teaching leash [70:18] pressure you teach them to to pull and [70:20] you reward that behavior of course if [70:22] you're going to have the dog pull you [70:23] want to make sure you have on a really [70:25] good harness [70:26] there are companies that make harnesses [70:29] for sled dogs that would be the type of [70:32] harness that i would recommend for [70:33] pulling they are [70:35] custom made for each dog so it would fit [70:38] your dog perfectly you set in the [70:39] measurements because you don't want a [70:41] dog pulling on a cheap harness something [70:44] that's not going to distribute the [70:46] weight properly across the dog's chest [70:49] and shoulders so [70:51] i don't remember the name of the company [70:53] but there is a company as i said that [70:55] makes [70:57] harnesses for sled dogs and that's [70:59] probably going to be the best for [71:00] something like that [71:05] do you think it's bad idea to have a dog [71:07] that can physically overpower you even [71:09] if you're a good dog trainer with a lot [71:11] of knowledge on dog behavior so if [71:13] you're talking about let's say you're a [71:15] professional dog trainer [71:17] and you're going to take in a dog to [71:19] train [71:20] that could overpower you [71:23] i would only be concerned about that [71:26] if [71:27] the dog was aggressive [71:30] working with aggressive dogs can be very [71:32] stressful [71:34] some people like it [71:36] i've never been a fan of working with a [71:39] aggressive dogs but [71:40] more often than not [71:43] it's fear aggression so once you develop [71:45] a relationship with the dog a lot of [71:48] those aggressive issues [71:50] go away especially when we can [71:52] communicate with them more clearly a lot [71:54] of times like if you go on youtube and [71:57] you type [71:58] frankie the demon dog nate shomer [72:01] this was a bull terrier [72:04] that they said was this demon dog it was [72:06] on inside addition this dog was horrible [72:08] aggressive would would attack the [72:10] cameraman and everything and i had the [72:12] dog for i think two or three weeks [72:14] something like that [72:15] and the dog was just misunderstood [72:18] the dog didn't know what was right what [72:20] was wrong and after working with the dog [72:21] for a little bit the dog was fine [72:23] so most aggression stems from fear it [72:27] can stem from confusion it could also be [72:29] a form of bluffing but when we're [72:32] dealing with a real true aggressive dog [72:35] which there's not that many out there [72:37] then i would be really hesitant with [72:39] wanting to i wouldn't want to be alone [72:41] let me put it this way i wouldn't want [72:43] to be alone with a dog that was dominant [72:46] aggressive or forward aggressive dog and [72:48] i knew the dog can overpower me [72:50] that's going to be a scary situation to [72:52] be in and if you're afraid as many of [72:54] you already know the dog's going to pick [72:57] up on that and it's going to make the [72:58] situation even worse so don't put [73:01] yourself in a situation that you're not [73:03] comfortable or confident with [73:05] dogs that i've worked with that were [73:07] very aggressive dogs and i was concerned [73:10] about possibly being bit i would wear my [73:12] bite suit that i used for protection [73:14] training i put my bite suit on and i'd [73:16] start training the dog so if the dog did [73:19] bite me [73:20] it wasn't going to hurt and i was [73:22] confident because i knew i had the [73:24] protection gear on [73:25] but yeah don't put yourself in a [73:27] situation where [73:30] you're afraid [73:31] and you're worried about being [73:33] overpowered by a large dog [73:36] okay where was i [73:40] if you haven't seen the dog dance [73:42] competition you should look into it very [73:45] high level of course yeah that's cool [73:47] yeah i definitely agree those of you [73:48] that are watching pull up those dog [73:50] dance competitions they're really fun [73:52] and you can tell the dogs are having a [73:54] blast it's really just a lot of tricks [73:56] that they've taught the dog but they've [73:58] done it in a way where the handler and [73:59] the dog are they're literally doing a [74:01] dance it's really really cool [74:03] do puppies attention span typically grow [74:06] as they do or is it just the dog can you [74:08] help them want to learn longer somehow [74:11] so yes a dog's attention span will [74:14] increase as they get older [74:17] if you look at for example french ring [74:20] competition obedience [74:22] french ring level three a dog can be on [74:23] the field for 45 minutes and you may [74:26] think to yourself 45 minutes that is a [74:28] long time [74:29] but the dogs have gone over that routine [74:31] so many times they know it so it's not [74:34] like they're learning something new when [74:36] a dog is learning something new the [74:38] duration in which you can train them is [74:40] much shorter than having a dog doing [74:43] something they already know for a longer [74:46] period of time but just like with people [74:49] the duration the attention span will [74:51] increase as the dog becomes more [74:53] proficient and confident within the [74:55] training just always make sure if you're [74:57] teaching your dog something new that you [75:00] keep the sessions short [75:02] fun engaging so this way when you stop [75:05] the dog is excited to come back for the [75:07] next session and then they're going to [75:08] be able to learn that much better [75:14] i have a six month old uh where were we [75:19] i have a six month old male labrador [75:20] that has a habit of nipping jumping [75:23] overall spoiled rotten what advice do [75:25] you offer to stop this so something like [75:28] that if i got a six-month-old labrador [75:29] retriever sounds like just a [75:31] happy-go-lucky playful [75:33] dog just because a dog is mouthing or [75:36] biting that's a form of play it's a form [75:38] of wrestling socializing and a lot of [75:41] dogs enjoy that type of behavior [75:45] that dog comes in for training and the [75:46] owner tells me i don't want the dog to [75:48] jump and bite like this anymore [75:51] can you fix that of course i'm just [75:52] going to do obedience i'm going to go [75:54] through the process i'm going to do the [75:55] engagement training so i can communicate [75:57] clearly teach that continuation and [75:59] terminal marker i'm going to use the [76:00] lure to teach the dog what behaviors i [76:02] want him or her to perform i'm going to [76:06] just trying to see if there was a miller [76:08] male okay i'm going to teach the dog [76:10] leash pressure so i can control the dog [76:12] when they're doing things that i don't [76:13] want i'm going to implement the commands [76:16] develop reliability work on the stay so [76:18] i'm going to do obedience this way i can [76:20] clearly communicate what i want [76:23] if i had all that stuff already done and [76:25] the dog's doing that behavior so the dog [76:27] starts to nip [76:28] i i'm either going to use wrong and i'm [76:31] going to stop the dog with leash [76:32] pressure or i'm going to correct the dog [76:34] with a no and a leash pop [76:36] jumping same thing dog jumps wrong i'm [76:38] going to use the leash pressure if the [76:40] dog is beyond that i'm going to use a no [76:42] and i'm going to correct the dog just [76:43] remember the the leash pressure gives us [76:45] the opportunity to teach the dog the [76:48] rules and expectations without having to [76:50] correct them [76:52] i don't like to correct a dog unless i'm [76:54] pretty confident they know the rules [76:57] they know what's expected they know how [76:59] to turn off pressure by complying and [77:01] we've given them a very clear path to [77:03] success now as i mentioned before i will [77:05] correct day one dangerous behaviors i [77:08] will correct destructive behaviors right [77:11] away but we always want to make sure the [77:13] dog knows the rules before we start [77:15] correcting them [77:19] right [77:20] thanks for the tips yeah mine has [77:21] randomly decided recently that he hates [77:23] french bulldogs and i haven't been sure [77:26] how to discourage his talk racism that's [77:28] funny [77:29] uh hopefully the advice the [77:32] advice helps [77:33] she heals great for treats and barely at [77:36] all when i don't have treats how do i [77:37] bridge the gap okay so what i would [77:40] recommend if you're having issues where [77:41] your dog is performing really well when [77:43] you have rewards but not when you don't [77:45] have rewards [77:47] watch the episode that i posted on [77:49] training without treats it wasn't [77:52] i'll just put it in the comments real [77:54] quick [77:55] so this is something that comes up quite [77:56] often people want to know because in my [77:59] videos i'm using treats throughout the [78:01] video and that's because when we're [78:03] teaching a new behavior we're doing [78:05] continual reinforcement we're rewarding [78:07] the correct repetition of every single [78:09] behavior [78:10] all right so let me see where is [78:12] training without treats [78:14] there we go [78:17] so follow this process and you should be [78:20] able to get to a point where [78:22] you can get the dog to perform the [78:24] behavior without having to give treats [78:26] the entire time in addition to that [78:29] corrections help as well but i want to [78:31] make sure remember in order for our dogs [78:33] to do something [78:35] they have to either so like we ask a dog [78:37] to do something well why is the dog [78:39] doing the behavior we have to think [78:41] about motivation motivation determines [78:43] our dog's behaviors if we look at it in [78:45] the most simplified manner [78:47] access something pleasant prevent [78:49] something unpleasant so the dog is doing [78:51] something we're asking them to perform [78:53] either a they're doing it because they [78:55] enjoy being around us they enjoy working [78:57] with us which is a possibility usually [79:00] more common for our labrador retriever [79:02] type dogs [79:03] or they're doing it for the possibility [79:05] of receiving a reward or they're doing [79:08] it to prevent the possibility of [79:10] receiving a correction and if none of [79:12] those are there the dog will not do the [79:15] behavior so we have to make sure we're [79:18] influencing our dog's behaviors by [79:20] implementing the right motivating [79:21] factors that are going to contribute to [79:24] the dog that we want [79:26] all right let's see [79:28] do you include protection dogs as one of [79:30] those aggressive dogs one should not [79:32] have if they can overpower you [79:34] protection dogs it really depends on how [79:37] the protection dog was trained so most [79:41] sport protection dogs are [79:44] actually i don't want to say most [79:45] because there's a lot of protection dogs [79:47] out there sport protection dogs and i've [79:50] probably met around [79:52] between 50 to 100 so [79:54] my frame of reference in comparison to [79:56] how many people actually train [79:58] protection sport dogs is rather small if [80:00] we're looking at that way but from my [80:02] experience most of the protection dogs [80:04] that i've been around with and i've had [80:05] the opportunity to work with and catch [80:07] on a bite suit they've been very [80:08] friendly dogs because the dogs were [80:10] trained [80:12] on a prey drive so they were never put [80:16] into defense they were taught prey drive [80:18] meaning when i came out with the bite [80:20] suit on or the bite sleeve i was wearing [80:22] the dog's toy so the dog wasn't [80:24] aggressive the dog was taught how to do [80:27] protection type exercises but the dog [80:29] wasn't an aggressive dog so i you [80:32] usually wouldn't include protection as [80:34] an aggressive dog an aggressive dog [80:37] usually falls underneath either fear [80:39] aggression dominant aggression forward [80:42] aggression and more often than not [80:44] you're not going to [80:47] run into very rarely are we going to run [80:49] into dominant aggressive dogs i've only [80:51] come across a couple since i've been [80:53] training dogs professionally [80:58] uh [80:59] sorry it's just i like big dog breeds [81:01] yet i'm 5'6 and not a lot of muscle [81:04] yeah i mean 5'6 still isn't bad for [81:06] being a dog trainer i've worked with [81:08] plenty of dog trainers that were shorter [81:09] than that and were able to get control [81:11] the more experience you have and the [81:12] more dogs you work with the easier it's [81:13] going to be my biggest recommendation if [81:16] if you're around a dog that you're [81:17] afraid of that's going to have an impact [81:19] on your training [81:21] so either find a way to not be afraid of [81:23] the dog or don't work with that type of [81:24] dog [81:29] okay any tips on becoming a dog trainer [81:31] yes i talked about that at the very [81:33] beginning of the video [81:35] i have my first uh dog accidentally was [81:38] a working line german shepherd it's been [81:40] fun watching him learn would love to get [81:42] into the dog training world [81:44] so yeah if you're if you're in the [81:46] states there's different dog training [81:47] schools you can go to there's also star [81:49] mark academy besides tom rose school and [81:54] kennel wood you have learberg online [81:56] university they have some good online [81:58] courses [82:00] one of my biggest [82:01] recommendations because not everyone can [82:03] afford a dog trainer school not everyone [82:05] can leave their profession their career [82:08] to go learn a new skill [82:11] find a mentor join a club [82:13] joining obedience or protection clubs is [82:16] a great way to learn how to become a dog [82:17] trainer [82:19] yep keeping the sessions short [82:21] absolutely and keeping them positive and [82:23] ending on a positive note absolutely [82:25] correct bk [82:26] uh what do you think about pit bulls [82:29] just like any dog breed out there [82:32] there are really amazing dogs in every [82:35] single dog breed and there are some that [82:38] can be issues pit bulls are no different [82:41] i've worked with some of the most [82:42] amazing pit bulls you'll ever meet in [82:43] your entire life and i've worked with [82:45] pit bulls that were convicted murderers [82:47] meaning they've killed another dog [82:50] i've worked with huskies that were [82:52] incredibly fun to work with i've worked [82:54] with huskies that were so stubborn and [82:56] independent that they were no fun to [82:58] work with so i look at dogs more so as [83:01] an individual now with something like [83:04] powerful dog breeds i think somebody [83:06] should be well educated i think the [83:09] person should know how to handle the dog [83:11] i don't think anyone should get [83:15] a large or powerful dog breed without [83:17] being well educated without knowing how [83:19] to handle the dog and to properly take [83:21] care of and raise a dog and keep the dog [83:23] safe happy and healthy [83:26] it's easier to get away with having a [83:28] small dog if you don't know much about [83:30] dog training because there's less risks [83:33] but a very large dog should be taken [83:36] seriously regardless of the breed [83:40] okay [83:43] uh do you ever need to think about a [83:45] dog's teeth health health yes in fact i [83:48] was going to do a video on it before so [83:50] there's a local place out here in la i [83:53] don't remember they okay let me rephrase [83:55] that they're not really they're local [83:56] but they go to different facilities so [83:58] one of them if you're in the los angeles [84:00] area blue collar working dog that's [84:03] where i found out about them and they [84:04] clean the dog's teeth so you do it [84:06] annually i like to give my dogs raw dog [84:09] bones with raw meat on it that will help [84:11] clean their teeth there's also different [84:14] products out there like bright box for [84:17] example i've never used them i'm aware [84:19] of them because they've reached out to [84:21] me before but they have a this way to [84:24] keep your dog's teeth clean i've used [84:25] those honeycombs i had in one of my [84:27] videos i think they're called honeycomb [84:29] but yeah keeping your dog's teeth and [84:31] gums healthy is definitely important [84:34] often feeding a dogs or feeding your dog [84:36] a raw diet helps keep them clean but raw [84:39] bones and then like i said there's [84:41] certain products out there that help [84:42] brushing your dog's teeth as well is [84:44] really good [84:48] okay awesome [84:49] i think that's a good session for today [84:52] hopefully we'll be doing another one [84:54] soon i have to get ready i have a lesson [84:55] coming up thanks everybody for watching [84:58] thanks for taking part for social life [85:00] socializing for sharing the videos and [85:03] commenting and being a part of [85:04] everything it's been awesome i [85:06] appreciate

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 412/841,""" === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] we are on episode three in a three [00:02] episode series on tricks for your dogs [00:05] i'm here in georgia with professional [00:07] dog trainer maureen cuccinella at her [00:09] business spirited k9 and she's going to [00:11] be going over five really cool unique [00:14] tricks that you could teach your dogs [00:16] let's go ahead and get started all right [00:18] so the next trick we're going to teach [00:19] is a really fun one and it's pretty [00:20] practical it's how to teach your dog to [00:22] wipe their paws on a rug okay so really [00:25] nice on those muddy days because it [00:26] actually does work pretty well for that [00:28] so obviously you need a rug and you need [00:30] some treats okay so i got some of these [00:32] freeze-dried treats here so i'm going to [00:33] take these treats and i'm going to put [00:35] them under the corner of the rug okay so [00:38] you see she already knows what's going [00:39] on i'm going to put them under the [00:40] corner here and i want to make sure that [00:42] maybe i'm holding it down so the dog [00:44] doesn't try to use their nose to get the [00:46] treats up i want them to use their feet [00:47] so i'm going to bring her back over here [00:48] because she remembered the other corner [00:50] we just did a practice run celia come [00:52] here look [00:54] and we're going to see [00:55] here you see it i can show it to her if [00:58] she needs to see it oh yeah see [01:00] yes i'll mark and then i'll open it up [01:02] and let her get it okay [01:05] oh yeah that was a good little jackpot [01:06] there huh so then we're gonna do that [01:08] again [01:10] ready [01:13] yes good job [01:15] and i open the corner okay and then this [01:17] time i'm going to wait until she uses [01:19] her other foot all right because i want [01:20] the dog to use both their feet at some [01:22] point not just one foot so i'm going to [01:23] put them right on this the rug here and [01:25] i'm going to wait yes to use her other [01:26] foot so i'm going to go ahead and reward [01:28] her now we can get it on cue since it's [01:30] predictable so i'll tell her wipe your [01:33] paws and i stay in that town look at you [01:36] i'm going to stay in that tone so it's [01:38] nice and consistent wipe your paws yes [01:41] good girl and i open up the rug and then [01:43] eventually you can move your body away [01:45] from it okay [01:47] so that way you're not part of the cue [01:49] wipe your paws [01:51] yes you're so cute and then i open up [01:54] the rug and then you can also now [01:56] introduce this kind of motion for fun so [01:58] make it look like um you're you're doing [02:01] it together if you're like doing a cute [02:02] little video or something there we go [02:04] wipe your paws [02:06] yes good job and i opened up the rug [02:09] and eventually just fade out the food no [02:11] big deal very easy to fill out the food [02:13] um sometimes i'll just ask her to do it [02:15] so [02:16] wipe your paws [02:18] yes [02:19] and i'll just mark for it and deliver [02:20] the food right to her mouth a very easy [02:22] trick very useful trick really cute [02:24] trick um wipe your paws [02:27] okay so this next trick that we have is [02:29] shame on you okay so this is where i [02:30] pretend to be mad at her i say shame on [02:32] you and she's supposed to run and well [02:34] unless i say run she'll walk quickly and [02:36] hide her head under this pillow so it's [02:39] really cute looking so here's the end [02:40] result celia [02:42] shame on you [02:44] yes good job she's sniffing around under [02:47] there for some snacks [02:48] but it's really easy to teach at first [02:50] so you need a pillow or some kind of [02:52] object that your dog can hide their face [02:54] under so pillows right here [02:57] and i'll take some snacks celia [02:59] you still thinking about that rug yeah [03:02] and i'm going to just put the snack [03:03] under here and let her get it just like [03:05] that very very easy right so i'll just [03:07] put it under the pillow just like that [03:10] put it under the pillow right i'm not [03:12] really even marking because the dog is [03:14] just going after the food right there's [03:16] nothing really i need to communicate [03:18] right in that moment so she's just going [03:20] right for that food okay so eventually [03:22] what she's going to start doing is she's [03:24] going to start seeking for the seeking [03:26] for the food by putting her face under [03:28] the pillow right so i put it right under [03:30] there and when that starts to happen [03:33] that's where i can name it shame on you [03:34] yes [03:35] good girl [03:36] right so right as she starts to do it is [03:38] when i add the word shame on you [03:41] yes good job right that one i kind of [03:43] cued to her to do good girl my bad hey [03:47] shame on you [03:49] yes good job [03:51] but it has to be predictable so after [03:52] your dog is pre able to be predicted um [03:55] that they're going to put their face [03:56] under the pillow that's when you start [03:58] to name it okay it might take your dog a [04:00] couple sessions this dog has known this [04:01] trick since she was like one year old so [04:04] we're gonna wait till she tries to put [04:05] her face under the pillow [04:07] yes and i can mark and reward it i [04:09] should have named it but i got busy [04:10] blabbering [04:11] shame on you [04:13] oh that's not really it [04:15] really cute little booper there shame on [04:17] you [04:18] yes good job all right i'll do a couple [04:21] more of those good girl right so there's [04:23] no food under it anymore and she's gonna [04:26] put her face under it shame on you [04:29] yes [04:30] good job [04:32] right so super easy trick super cute at [04:34] the end if you you could do this little [04:36] thing for emphasis for fun if you like [04:38] showing it to somebody celia [04:40] shame on you [04:43] yes i wasn't really hidden under it but [04:46] i was pretty happy with how cute you [04:47] looked with it so very easy trick very [04:50] cute trick [04:51] that shame on you all right so next is [04:54] how to teach your dog to jump into your [04:56] arms so the very first step is we have [04:58] to get your dog confidently jumping up [05:00] into your lap this trick is new for [05:02] monster here so she might make some [05:04] mistakes she might hesitate and it's [05:06] okay i'll help show you how to deal with [05:08] those things now first of all make sure [05:10] you have a dog that's an appropriate [05:11] size [05:12] all right don't teach your great dane [05:14] how to jump into your arms it's not the [05:16] best hit so this is suited for a more [05:18] medium-sized to smaller sized dog [05:20] monster i know isn't he fun sit good [05:23] girl so i'm gonna get some snacks i'm [05:24] gonna put the snack in my right hand [05:26] since she's coming up on my left side i [05:28] want her to get the snack across my body [05:31] over here so we'll probably see some [05:33] hesitation so [05:34] first your dog has to understand how to [05:36] jump up onto an object confidently and [05:38] off of it just like with a back stall if [05:40] they're good with that they're going to [05:42] be a lot more um [05:44] likely to jump onto your lap so from [05:47] here i'm going to get her to jump into [05:49] my lap i personally use the cue hooray [05:52] to get her to jump up here because [05:53] that's what i want as my end cue [05:56] monster hurray [05:58] yes and you notice i kind of tap on my [05:59] lap a little bit just add some [06:01] encouragement and i also want to get the [06:03] dog used to being up off the ground in [06:06] my arms not with stable support right so [06:09] she's still new with this so you'll see [06:11] i'm feeding her a lot so she is [06:13] comfortable with being up in the air [06:15] when i first started this with her free [06:17] she um she wouldn't eat when she was in [06:18] my hands because she was like what is [06:20] happening so that's common to happen [06:22] first if so just put your dog on the [06:24] ground and then pay them and eventually [06:26] as they get used to this they will get [06:27] more confident with being held in your [06:29] arms so i'm going to do this again with [06:31] her and then we can start adding a [06:32] little bit more height sit [06:35] good girl hooray [06:37] yes good girl so i get her up and then [06:40] i'll hold her here [06:42] free and i get her down very nice okay [06:45] so i'm going to add a little bit more [06:46] height so you can do this with like a [06:48] stool like i use a stool sometimes like [06:51] i'm not in my training center i'm [06:52] practicing this in the house i use like [06:54] a bar stool and i'll get her to jump on [06:56] my lap while i'm sitting on the bar [06:57] stool and then you can use some pillows [07:00] to slowly start to add some height you [07:02] can do this in a regular dining room [07:04] chair as well so let me go ahead and [07:05] grab some more platforms [07:08] monster up [07:10] good girl [07:12] all right a little bit more height you [07:14] want to do this very gradually monster [07:15] come good sit [07:17] good so we slightly increased it [07:21] thank you so we slightly increased the [07:23] height [07:24] just a little bit of increase the dog's [07:25] gonna pick up on that we might see her [07:27] attitude go down because she's gonna be [07:28] a little unsure or we might see her get [07:30] a little confused okay so from here i'll [07:32] get my treats ready [07:34] hooray [07:35] yes all right very good successful [07:37] repetition right there [07:39] and i'm gonna put her right on the [07:40] ground free and then add a little bit [07:42] more height [07:45] hooray yes good job add some more height [07:49] free that's super [07:51] so you see i'm kind of standing [07:53] and slightly sitting so we might see [07:55] some confusion here [07:58] hooray [07:59] never mind yes [08:00] i love when that happens [08:02] and i'll pay her [08:03] very good and we'll do a little bit more [08:05] height [08:06] so i want to be slightly at angle and [08:08] this is where we're going to end and [08:10] eventually you can just stand straight [08:11] up and do this but i'm going to be at a [08:13] little bit of an angle to help her out [08:14] because this is a big step for her [08:17] hooray [08:18] yes that was perfect [08:21] that's actually the first time she's [08:22] done it from me standing like that um in [08:25] this room we've done it in the house and [08:27] up at the boarding house but i'm really [08:28] proud of her because she's pretty [08:30] sensitive to different environments so [08:31] yeah that's how we start teaching the [08:33] dog how to jump into our arms it's a [08:35] super fun trick and it's super cute and [08:37] over time it actually helps build their [08:39] confidence with being picked up as well [08:41] next up we're teaching the dog to put [08:43] their feet on your feet while they're [08:45] between your legs okay so i call this [08:48] command toes but you need to [08:50] what your dog needs to know is how to go [08:52] between your legs before you even start [08:54] teaching this trick so if your dog [08:55] doesn't know how to go between your legs [08:57] not confident that position teach that [08:59] first then you can do this one so really [09:01] fun trick is actually a lot easier than [09:03] i initially thought it would be so [09:05] first you get your dog under under and [09:07] she does this little spin thing to get [09:09] under which i personally like yes [09:11] so when the dog is under you [09:14] keep their face busy so that you can get [09:15] your feet ready so you want your feet to [09:18] be tilted inwards it's really awkward [09:20] feeling at first but then you can lure [09:22] the dog onto your toes [09:24] just like this [09:26] yes and then pay [09:27] when they touch your toes good job yes [09:30] just like that okay so in the beginning [09:32] you have to have your feet bent and kind [09:33] of help them out help them teach that [09:35] target monster's been practicing yes [09:37] this one for a while so she's pretty [09:39] confident yes with her feet on my feet [09:41] so for her it's easy your dogs might [09:43] need a little bit more work to get their [09:44] feet [09:45] on your feet yes so free [09:48] there we go so we're going to do this [09:50] again [09:51] monster [09:52] under [09:53] i get her under good girl and then i get [09:56] keep her mouth busy while i adjust my [09:57] toes and then i can lure her right onto [09:59] my toes yes and i can pay right here yes [10:02] just like that yes [10:05] yes [10:08] free [10:09] very good so then [10:11] we're going to start having our feet [10:13] positioned like a normal person now and [10:15] actually moving forward obviously make [10:17] sure your dog is consistently touching [10:19] your dog before you do that yes you're [10:21] so cute [10:22] under [10:23] get my dog under [10:25] and then i'm going to go ahead and lure [10:27] her feet right onto my toes this time i [10:29] have my feet pointed slightly inwards [10:31] not yes nearly as drastic as it was [10:33] before and then if i want to start [10:35] adding some movement i can lure her and [10:38] move my feet and your dog's feet are [10:39] supposed to stay on your toes like this [10:42] just like that right now her foot came [10:44] off a little bit there no big deal she [10:45] reset she fixed it free and then i can [10:48] free the dog okay and then over time you [10:50] can fade out the lures you can fade out [10:52] the help because straighten out your [10:53] feet more under [10:55] good girl and you can start adding the [10:57] cue toes [10:59] yes good girl [11:01] yes good job [11:03] and then i can start [11:05] yes walking [11:06] with her feet [11:08] on my feet [11:09] yes super silly trick super fun trick [11:12] absolutely love it free good girl [11:16] i call it toes i've heard people call [11:18] other things [11:19] but yeah that's how you teach your dog [11:21] toes next trick is crawl so [11:24] army crawling your dog's belly's on the [11:26] ground they're moving their legs they're [11:27] doing the shimmy thing it's really cute [11:29] so obviously your dog needs to know how [11:31] to be in a down position and be [11:33] comfortable in that position before you [11:34] can teach crawl so after your dog knows [11:36] a nice down then you can start teaching [11:39] the dog to move forward a little bit so [11:41] i start off with putting the lure right [11:43] in her face [11:44] having it towards the ground [11:46] moving it just a teeny bit yes marking [11:49] and rewarding any little effort this is [11:52] easier for some dogs it's harder for [11:54] other dogs other dogs you might need to [11:55] use your arm as a guide if they try to [11:58] pop up from that down position you can [12:00] guide the arm don't push it down it's [12:02] just there to help guide them so they're [12:03] less likely to get up so [12:06] very easy crawl and then we introduce [12:09] the snack yes we pay that effort and [12:11] then you can introduce more and more [12:14] distance that the dog is crawling crawl [12:18] yes good job [12:20] crawl [12:22] yes good job [12:24] crawl [12:25] and then over time [12:27] your dog's going to get comfortable with [12:28] that now [12:30] we got the dog crawling when we're on [12:32] the ground next to them a lot of us want [12:34] our dogs to be in a down away from us [12:36] and be able to crawl to you from a [12:38] longer distance right this is how you [12:40] get that so first of all your dog has to [12:42] understand how to touch a target right [12:45] i'm using this one here because [12:46] initially i put peanut butter on this [12:48] and i would have her lick it as i moved [12:50] it now she's really good at touching it [12:52] so i don't have to do that but you can [12:54] do that with your dog if they have any [12:55] issues so shoehorn just straight from [12:57] amazon very easy uh so i'm going to put [13:00] it right in front of her face and i'm [13:01] going to tell her crawl yes good job now [13:03] mark and i'll pay her on the ground [13:06] between her feet kind of important where [13:07] the reward comes from because your dog's [13:09] going to want to be a magnet to where [13:10] it's coming from are we going to roll [13:11] over now is this what we're doing [13:14] okay come here man good down good stay [13:18] let's wander to stop crawling [13:20] there we go so i give her a stay [13:22] all right here we go [13:25] crawl [13:25] yes so i start off with the target [13:27] closer to her [13:29] and then i can move it further [13:32] that's not that's a bug crawl [13:37] yes there we go she's kind of looking [13:39] around there a little confused exactly [13:40] where she was going no big deal i just [13:42] waited until she re-engaged at the [13:43] target so i'm going to move it further [13:46] stay [13:48] crawl [13:50] yes and she's anticipating a little bit [13:52] she's crawling a little bit more before [13:53] i want her to it's okay [13:55] good girl stay and i'm gonna go even [13:57] further this time [13:59] crawl [14:01] oh you cheated [14:03] yes so often times i'll show you how to [14:05] deal with that because your dog's going [14:06] to do that at some point monster free [14:09] down so when they start [14:11] here we go when they start [14:13] wanting to get up to move because that's [14:16] easier i'll throw in a down command and [14:17] then we'll start over all right so the [14:19] dog starts to anticipate oh i'm getting [14:21] up she's going to want me to down so i'm [14:22] just going to be closer to the ground so [14:26] crow [14:31] yes there we go very good but i like [14:34] this target because i can get that [14:35] distance and it's coming from down here [14:39] good girl crawl [14:41] down so there she goes she tried to [14:43] cheat again stay [14:45] good girl [14:46] she's trying to follow my visual cues [14:48] that's okay stay good girl try again [14:51] curl [14:54] good girl [14:58] yes there we go and over time you can [15:01] fade that out i have this silly little [15:03] hand signal where i do like a little man [15:04] walking like this so [15:07] to get her freeze-dried treats really [15:09] quick good girl so i'm going to give her [15:11] that cue so you can see it without any [15:13] more targets the finished product crumb [15:20] good girl [15:23] good [15:24] job good job [15:27] yes [15:28] that's good enough i'm happy with that [15:30] and that's how you teach your dog the [15:32] army crawl [15:33] [Laughter] [15:35] thanks again for watching i hope you [15:36] guys enjoyed today's episode make sure [15:38] you hit

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 415/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we're going to be working with a [00:01] young dog and we're going to be teaching [00:03] this dog the first three steps to [00:05] develop our communication channels the [00:07] most important thing when working with a [00:09] dog is being able to let them know in a [00:11] timely manner when they're right and [00:13] when they're wrong and I'm going to show [00:15] you today exactly how to do that the [00:17] very first thing we're going to focus on [00:19] is the engagement training now remember [00:20] this is going to be the word or sound [00:22] that we use that predicts a reward known [00:25] as a condition reinforcer a condition [00:27] reinforcer in order for it to be [00:29] condition reinforcer it must predict the [00:31] primary now remember the primary is [00:32] going to be food toy or affection I like [00:35] to reserve my markers as a predictor of [00:38] food or toys since we pet our dogs all [00:41] the time I don't feel like petting is as [00:43] valuable as an actual treat and since [00:46] she's a lab labs love their food which [00:49] makes it much easier to teach new [00:51] behaviors now also remember when we're [00:53] first teaching new behaviors we do [00:54] continual reinforcement so that means [00:57] we're rewarding every single correct rep [00:59] ition during this step we're going to be [01:02] teaching two markers and in order for a [01:04] marker to be a marker it must predict [01:06] one of the four quadrants of oper [01:07] conditioning so that's your positive and [01:09] negative reinforcement positive and [01:11] negative punishment this is going to be [01:13] predicting positive reinforcement now it [01:16] also has to guarantee the reward if we [01:19] make this sound it means we're going to [01:22] pay her guaranteed it's not we pay [01:25] sometimes and not the other times it's [01:27] every single time that's what makes a [01:28] marker so valuable now when we do this [01:31] the two markers we're going to be [01:32] teaching one is known as a continuation [01:34] marker the easiest way to remember [01:36] sounds is by what it predicts so I'm [01:40] going to demonstrate in the very [01:41] beginning what I do is I take the food I [01:43] show the dog the food I want them to [01:45] know I have something of value I bring [01:47] it up by my face so the dog looks up at [01:50] my face now they're looking at the food [01:52] in our hand they're not stupid if I [01:54] start moving my hand around the dog's [01:55] going to follow my hand they also are [01:57] attracted to movement just like us so [01:59] I'm going to hold it by my face once [02:01] your dog looks up at me I'm going to say [02:03] the marker we're going we're going to [02:05] use yes as a continuation marker so yes [02:08] means a reward that's it it does not [02:10] change the dog circumstances it just [02:13] means she's going to be paid and then [02:15] we're going to use the word free I [02:17] believe is what we were using right free [02:19] means release and reward so if she is in [02:22] a stay it will release her from that [02:24] stay and it guarantees a reward the way [02:27] I'm going to do this is I'm going to [02:28] show her the food I'm going to hold My [02:30] Hands by my face once she looks at me [02:32] I'm going to say the continuation marker [02:35] I'm going to pause for about a half [02:36] second then I'm going to deliver the [02:38] reward after I Mark and I go to deliver [02:42] the reward it's okay to talk to the dog [02:43] as well meaning I can say the marker [02:46] hand her the tree good girl nice job and [02:48] praise her and pet her so it doesn't [02:49] have to be super robotic once she eats [02:52] that which is going to be pretty quick [02:53] and she looks back up at me I'm going to [02:55] use the terminal marker and then I'm [02:56] just going to drop back using that body [02:59] Lang we're using uh prey drive by moving [03:02] away and we're using her food drive cuz [03:04] she knows we have the food that's going [03:06] to teach her to get up to come and get [03:08] the reward once she's conditioned to the [03:10] two markers you no longer have to do [03:12] that movement meaning let's say you want [03:14] to tell her to do it down you tell her [03:16] down She lays down you don't have to say [03:19] the terminal marker and then move back [03:21] she's already conditioned at that point [03:22] so you could just say the marker in hand [03:23] it to her and she knows that she can get [03:25] up at that point so I'm showing her the [03:27] food bring it to my face yes and then [03:31] reward notice the [03:33] pause free and then I move back very [03:36] good nice job show her again the food we [03:40] can really manipulate the dog's position [03:42] by using that power steering I'm going [03:43] to switch hands as well yes then reward [03:48] again notice that half second pause free [03:51] and then move back good girl and you see [03:52] that gets her excited since she is a [03:55] higher energy dog when we do start [03:58] showing her behaviors we're going to use [04:00] the continuation marker a little bit [04:01] more just to slow her down a little bit [04:05] when I've worked with her and I have her [04:07] sitting and then I'll say come and [04:10] she'll come and she'll like jump up on [04:11] me before she turns around and sits so [04:14] that just means that she doesn't fully [04:16] know the entire completion of the [04:18] exercise she knows to run to you and [04:20] then she's really excited so she's [04:21] jumping up on you we're just going to [04:23] show her the actual exercises to come up [04:25] and sit so doing enough repetitions is [04:27] going to help with that so again she's [04:28] looking at me yes and I'm not asking her [04:31] to do any commands nothing like that I [04:33] just want her to look at me free and [04:36] then again we move back you want to [04:38] continue this exercise until she's [04:40] conditioned to the markers now if you do [04:42] this correctly and your timing is right [04:44] then it usually takes most dogs a day [04:47] maybe two or three to become fully [04:49] conditioned and what I mean by [04:50] conditioned is they know that when they [04:52] hear yes they're going to receive a [04:54] reward and how did Ivan pavlof know that [04:57] his dogs were conditioned in his studies [04:59] where he Det what classical conditioning [05:00] was they would salivate the four most [05:03] common change of behaviors I see is [05:05] opening their mouth licking their lips [05:07] salivating or moving their paws which is [05:09] very common with our Labs so let's try [05:11] the free so you're going to say free [05:12] don't move free now move very good [05:15] timing was much better and then give her [05:17] the reward excellent yeah it's it's [05:19] always harder than it looks but this [05:20] very hard these details make the biggest [05:23] difference so say there we go and then [05:24] move back now I recommend when you're [05:28] practicing this fil yourself and then [05:31] watch the footage because you're going [05:32] to be able to critique yourself better [05:34] than anyone else and you'll notice so [05:36] the most important thing is of course [05:38] our timing but being able to identify [05:40] when we're making a mistake so the fact [05:43] that you did it and you knew you you [05:45] paed it a little bit that's a great [05:47] indicator that you're going to end up [05:49] doing very well because you're aware of [05:50] the mistake if we're not aware of it [05:51] then we're not able fix not the dog now [05:54] we're going to move on to the second [05:55] step I want to make sure I'm holding the [05:57] food in my hand to where it's easy for [06:00] her to grab it so we create a little [06:01] Valley that way she can place her muzzle [06:03] into the valley and she can get a piece [06:05] of food I don't like doing this all the [06:07] time cuz you can see that's a little [06:09] harder for her to grab so cupping it in [06:11] our hand works really well once I get to [06:14] that point when she's doing the [06:15] behaviors the way that you love that's [06:18] when you can start naming them that's [06:19] when we can start saying sit and down [06:21] and come and all this so what I want to [06:23] do for the sit all I do is I walk [06:25] backwards I do a little bow and then [06:28] when she gets to me I lift up so she [06:29] sits right in front of me and that's [06:32] going to also be the same cue that we do [06:34] with come when called so come and sit [06:36] are very similar so see how I get her to [06:37] move I lift yes and then I reward I get [06:41] her to move I lift free and then I [06:44] reward what most people do is the dog's [06:46] already sitting and they go how do I get [06:48] my dog to stand up well you just get [06:49] them to move move back and then we lift [06:51] okay yes and then reward come when [06:53] called very similar I just keep my hands [06:55] in the center because I want the dog to [06:58] come and sit center now she's CR it [06:59] there you're not competing with her so [07:01] it really doesn't matter yes but that [07:03] shows them when I call you I don't want [07:05] you to run and jump up on me I want you [07:08] to run and sit in front of me nicely I [07:10] also like to teach dogs to spin because [07:12] it makes the training a little bit more [07:13] fun with the heel I step back with my [07:17] left leg I guide the dog around and once [07:19] they get into position then I'm marking [07:21] reward for the center but you're not [07:24] saying anything after you exactly cuz [07:27] during this step I want her to focus on [07:29] my body body language and also when we [07:31] start naming behaviors so like let's say [07:33] for example she's really good at [07:36] following the food but let's say she [07:37] wasn't that great at it and she would go [07:40] down very slowly I wouldn't want to name [07:42] that behavior because then she's going [07:44] to end up more likely than not doing the [07:46] behavior slowly I want the behavior to [07:49] look a specific way before I put it on [07:51] command CU once I put it on command then [07:54] that's going to be how she performs it [07:56] more likely than not if you have a dog [07:58] if you're working with a dog that has [07:59] lower perseverance you want to reward [08:02] effort so you would reward perhaps right [08:04] there cuz some dogs will start to turn [08:06] and they'll go H that's too much work [08:08] and they won't complete it but she has [08:10] really high perseverance and high food [08:12] drive so it makes it pretty easy and [08:14] again for the heel position we step back [08:15] with the left leg out and around and [08:19] then we put her into the sit next step [08:21] is going to be teaching her leash [08:23] pressure now leash pressure is negative [08:26] reinforcement we're going to use this [08:29] for Loos leash walking for teaching the [08:31] stay command for reinforcing boundaries [08:34] rules and expectations negative [08:37] reinforcement is not what people think [08:39] people always think negative [08:40] reinforcement is a punishment no it's [08:41] not negative reinforcement is we turn [08:44] pressure on when they comply we turn it [08:46] off the two most important things that [08:49] must take place when we're doing [08:50] negative reinforcement is number one [08:52] once the pressure is turned on it cannot [08:54] be turned off until they comply and [08:56] number two the moment they comply it has [08:59] to instant L be turned off turned off [09:01] when we turn on pressure this can be a [09:05] mildly stressful exercise for a dog [09:07] first time they learn it the way it was [09:09] taught traditionally was we would turn [09:11] the pressure on and we would just wait [09:13] till the dog figured it out now some [09:15] dogs would figure it out pretty quickly [09:18] other dogs would resist they bite at the [09:20] leash they flop on the ground they're [09:22] trying to do a behavior that's going to [09:25] turn the pressure off so when we turn on [09:28] this pressure what we're really doing is [09:30] we're presenting a problem we're saying [09:32] here's a problem do you know how to [09:34] solve it and she goes no I don't know [09:36] what to do or she goes yeah I do and she [09:38] does the behavior so what we do when [09:40] we're teaching this is we present the [09:42] dog with the problem and then we give [09:44] them the solution we don't wait for them [09:46] to figure it out and we do it enough [09:48] times to where we present the problem [09:51] and the dog gives us the answer or the [09:53] solution before we provide it for them [09:55] it's just like everything else that we [09:57] do so when I start this all I'm going to [09:59] do now I keep my hand behind my back [10:02] that has the food because what we will [10:05] do on accident is we will lure the dog [10:09] at the exact same time and then we're [10:10] not teaching the dog the leash pressure [10:13] in addition I'd like to get down to the [10:15] dog's level so I'm going to bring the [10:17] food behind my back I'm going to lift up [10:19] there's the pressure now I'm going to [10:21] give her the solution turn off the [10:24] pressure give her the food so remember [10:26] two most important things once it's [10:27] turned on well she did it so I turned [10:29] turn the pressure off we don't turn it [10:31] off until they comply the moment they [10:34] comply we instantly turn it [10:37] off so we apply pressure good she does [10:39] that nicely so I'm going to make her do [10:41] the sit position from there and then we [10:43] give her the answer turn off the [10:45] pressure reward when I'm doing this [10:47] exercise I'm not pulling hard you [10:49] shouldn't be physically pulling them [10:51] into the position it's a sensation she [10:54] feels it I'm not physically pulling her [10:56] up you see she still has a big smile on [10:57] her face she's waiting for the food now [11:00] I'm going to give her the answer I turn [11:01] out the pressure I'm marking reward it's [11:04] almost like she's saying I'm not going [11:05] to do it till I have the food yeah and [11:07] it's because she doesn't know if she [11:09] knew that sitting up right away would [11:10] turn it off and get her the treat she [11:12] would do it so we're going to do another [11:13] one turn off the pressure and reward in [11:16] addition I like to teach the dogs to go [11:18] into the down when I use my foot cuz I [11:20] don't like to have to bend down all the [11:22] time and this is a great way to help [11:24] teach the down command without blowing [11:26] out your lower back when I do this I [11:28] bring my leg leg up so the dog can see [11:30] it then I and she's already doing yes [11:33] you guys have worked on this already [11:35] with her for a little bit which helps [11:37] same thing when I go to lift up I lift [11:39] up and then once she complies we turn [11:42] the pressure off you want to Telegraph [11:45] when people always say don't Telegraph [11:47] this is one of the situations where you [11:48] want to Telegraph you want her to know [11:50] what you're doing before you do it [11:52] there's the pressure she goes to lay [11:53] down I turn the pressure off then I [11:55] would Mark and reward in the evening [11:58] when she's up here sleeping and it's [12:00] time to go outside to go get [12:02] busy I can have the leash on her and say [12:05] Millie let's go she will not comply and [12:09] even if I'm pulling her it's just like [12:12] she and I haven't used food for it but [12:15] it's a very common issue just because a [12:18] dog knows the sit command doesn't mean [12:21] they're always going to perform it just [12:23] like with people just cuz we know [12:25] something doesn't mean we'll always do [12:26] it what gets a dog to do Behavior we [12:28] always have to think about what gets our [12:30] dog to perform behaviors well those four [12:33] quadrants of Opera conditioning they're [12:34] either motivated by something a uh [12:36] they're either motivated by something [12:38] pleasant or motivated to prevent [12:40] something unpleasant and we get to [12:42] determine what we use to motivate them [12:45] to alter their behavior if I have her on [12:47] a climb and she knows leash pressure and [12:50] I go to apply the leash pressure that's [12:52] the same as her ignoring a command if we [12:54] want reliability from a command we [12:57] Implement Corrections so what I do with [13:00] the dog if they're resisting I apply the [13:02] pressure if the dog is resisting I say [13:05] no I pop the leash and then I go right [13:07] back into the pressure once you give [13:09] them a correction for resisting you find [13:12] that the moment that leash gets tight [13:14] they're complying right away because [13:16] they don't want to receive the [13:16] correction nice and [13:18] slow got to have that there we go turn [13:20] it off Mark and reward yes excellent and [13:23] then let's do with one with her getting [13:25] on the bed [13:29] yes yes sorry I was actually a little [13:32] early on that [13:35] one yes your timing was way better on [13:38] that one too really yes oh [13:41] yes yeah I have one now all right now [13:45] that we've developed the communication [13:46] channels those first three steps are the [13:48] most important if we can teach a dog [13:51] what sounds mean they're going to [13:53] receive a reward if we can teach them [13:55] how to turn off pressure by complying if [13:57] we can teach them how to follow a lure [13:59] now we can start teaching her all the [14:01] commands now remember a command to our [14:05] dogs is like a question if I came up to [14:08] you and I wanted you to perform a [14:11] behavior off of the word blue and I'm [14:13] like blue blue blue blue you're like I [14:17] don't know what you want me to do when [14:20] you make that my breath it's the same [14:22] thing with the dogs we get a dog and we [14:24] go sit sit sit sit sit sit and what do [14:28] they do they sit but why did she sit [14:30] because I said sit or because I was [14:32] making a bunch of noise and she's like [14:33] what's that noise and then her butt [14:35] naturally goes down and what do most [14:36] people do yay I taught my dog a Sit no [14:39] you just made a bunch of noise and your [14:41] dog looked at you and they naturally [14:43] said the same way you're looking at me [14:44] when I was telling you blue so in order [14:47] to get them to understand these commands [14:50] we say the command which is the question [14:52] do you know what to do when I tell you [14:54] to climb she's like no I don't know what [14:57] to do but I do know if I stare at you [14:58] you might give me a treat right oh you [15:01] know that word she turned her head a [15:02] little bit so now I'm going to say the [15:05] words that I want her to perform and [15:07] then I'm going to provide the answer [15:09] with a physical cue that we've already [15:13] established since we're not ready to [15:15] teach the stay once she gets into the [15:18] position we're asking her to perform [15:19] we're going to use the terminal marker [15:21] now this way we can do a lot of [15:24] repetition so she starts to learn what [15:26] questions link up to which answers and [15:29] then once we have that we can start [15:31] working on the stay and we can use the [15:33] continuation marker and reinforce with [15:36] the leash pressure all these things that [15:38] we taught her so these first three steps [15:40] this is really gold once somebody has [15:42] that you really don't even have to do [15:44] formal training sessions anymore and the [15:47] fact that you guys have her with you all [15:48] the time you're going to be able to [15:50] train her simply by having her with you [15:53] you sit down in the morning have your [15:55] cup of coffee you're reading a book you [15:57] put her in a climb next to you you're [15:59] working a climb stay you're taking her [16:00] on a walk you're working on a heel [16:02] you're working on automatic sit when [16:04] halted you're working on down you're [16:05] working on come when called you can do [16:07] all these things while just hanging out [16:10] with your dog so I'm going to show you [16:11] how we're going to incorporate the [16:13] commands pay attention to the fact that [16:15] I say the command then I present the [16:18] physical cue then I use the terminal [16:20] marker and then I praise and reward her [16:23] and we're going to do all the different [16:24] commands that we just went over I can [16:26] use lurry or I can use leash pressure so [16:30] I can [16:31] say climb and then guide her to the bed [16:35] free and then reward I said that a [16:37] little early but that's okay [16:40] free [16:44] [Music] [16:45] heel free [16:48] down [16:50] free sit free and I can do all of this [16:56] with the leash as well now with her it's [16:58] really nice because she's so food [17:00] motivated I know she's going to do the [17:02] behavior she really wants what I have [17:05] but not all dogs are like that you might [17:07] find you're working with another dog and [17:09] that dog may perform for the food [17:11] sometimes and other times may not really [17:13] care about the food that's where the [17:15] leash comes into play so if I have a dog [17:17] that's not as food motivated they're [17:19] interested but they're not as driven as [17:22] she is then I can use the leash so I can [17:24] do everything I just did but I'll use [17:26] the leash sit free that was very good on [17:30] her [17:31] part down and now I'm going to use the [17:35] leash [17:38] free [17:40] sit free [17:45] good and notice how I'm saying the [17:47] command I'm not moving and then I move [17:52] bed [17:56] free off [18:00] free what I want to do now since she's [18:03] really good at a stay when we're in the [18:06] room we're going to work on teaching her [18:08] a stay when we're not in the room so [18:11] we're going to do this very quickly and [18:13] I brought something for you guys to [18:14] start training with it's one of my [18:16] favorite tools to use when I'm working [18:17] with dogs I it's also really nice cuz [18:20] you can check in with your dog when [18:21] you're not at the house which I love to [18:23] do with my dogs so I brought it I [18:25] brought it in the bag right over here [18:26] let me grab it so what I brought today [18:28] to help us with the training is the [18:30] Furbo 360 this is excellent not only [18:33] does it track our dog it provides night [18:35] vision and it's going to allow us to [18:37] toss treats to reinforce positive [18:39] behaviors and we can also work on our [18:42] stay command when we're not in the room [18:45] and I know that's something you've been [18:46] struggling with so this is really going [18:48] to make that a much easier process all [18:50] right let's get the Furbo Box open it [18:52] comes with the Furbo and a quick start [18:55] guide so this helps us get it set up and [18:57] we're going to use use the Furbo to help [19:00] the training to make sure your dog knows [19:02] how to behave even when we're not in the [19:04] room now that we have the Furbo plugged [19:06] in we're going to add some treats this [19:08] is the Furbo 360 which is really cool [19:10] you can manually rotate the Furbo but it [19:12] also has an auto dog tracking so when [19:14] she's walking around it will track her [19:16] it can record that and send it to your [19:18] phone and there's a two-way audio on [19:21] here night vision full color and it has [19:24] a treat tossing which is adjustable so [19:27] we can do all these these things with [19:29] the features that are built into the [19:31] Furbo and it's going to help us with our [19:33] training and we can make sure she's [19:34] performing when we're not here just as [19:36] well as she does when we are here by [19:38] rewarding and setting up the proper [19:40] expectations now that we have the Furbo [19:42] downloaded we want to make sure we can [19:44] get your dog condition to the sound the [19:46] Furbo makes before it sends a treat one [19:49] of the best ways to do this is to [19:50] activate the Furbo without any treats [19:52] and then manually throw the treat to the [19:54] dog once she's comfortable with the [19:57] sound it's making then I'm going to [19:58] allow the Furbo to dispense the treat so [20:01] here we go there's the noise and then we [20:05] toss the treat now that she seems [20:07] comfortable with the sound that the [20:08] Furbo makes before it tosses a treat [20:10] we're going to load it up with treats so [20:12] the Furbo is actually tossing it instead [20:14] of me doing that I'm still going to act [20:17] like I'm tossing it though there we [20:22] go good girl come here puppy good girl [20:27] so she's looking at me very nice and now [20:29] I'm going to reward that behavior by [20:31] sending a [20:33] treat excellent she didn't even see that [20:35] one come out of the Furbo now what we're [20:37] going to do is we're going to work on [20:38] the bed stay when we're not in the room [20:40] so I'm going to place her on the bed [20:42] stay and then we're going to leave the [20:44] room we're going to be watching her [20:45] through the Furbo the moment she breaks [20:48] we're going to say wrong come inside and [20:50] reinforce the rules so we can see her [20:52] sitting there she's doing much better [20:54] now so she's already starting to [20:57] learn bro [21:00] another really cool feature is you're [21:01] able to send treats when your dog is [21:03] doing something that you like so she [21:05] just went up on the climb bed on her own [21:06] so let's go ahead and send her a treat [21:08] for [21:09] that and let's tell her she's a good [21:11] girl good girl Millie good girl okay [21:14] good job and that's a really great way [21:18] to reinforce behaviors with something [21:21] positive creating that strong positive [21:23] Association I absolutely love it another [21:26] really cool feature about the Furbo 360 [21:28] is it has smart alerts something you [21:31] want to make sure you do is subscribe to [21:33] the Furbo dog nanny in order to get [21:34] realtime smart alerts which will help [21:37] keep your pup safe and happy when we're [21:39] not at the house or when you're not at [21:41] the house some of the alerts are potty [21:43] alert chewing alert running alert it's [21:46] going to let you know if your dog is [21:48] performing any of these activities it [21:50] also gives you an alert if the dog is [21:52] continuously barking or crying and even [21:55] howling not to mention additional featur [21:58] such as home emergency alerts the glass [22:01] breaking alert all things that are going [22:03] to help keep your dog safe and healthy [22:06] sometimes when I want to take her on a [22:07] walk I'll say Millie walk and I'll go [22:09] get her leash and she'll like run away [22:11] from me or she'll sometimes come around [22:13] the table and I have to pull out a chair [22:16] to sort of trap her and she's okay with [22:18] the collar going on but I don't know [22:20] what it is it's like walk and she runs [22:22] the other way she's probably playing a [22:24] game it's probably something that's fun [22:25] for her so a really easy thing we can do [22:27] with that I'm going to take the the [22:28] leash off I know we had it on for the [22:30] training before you take her on a walk [22:32] just do something like placing her on a [22:34] climb bed that's a very easy way to [22:36] control her and then to prep her for the [22:38] walk so if she was my dog I would tell [22:40] her bed and then we'll ceue her onto the [22:43] bed if she needs help with a physical Q [22:45] still which is fine good girl I could [22:47] have rewarded her but now that I have [22:49] her on the climb bed it makes it much [22:51] easier to take the leash out gear her up [22:54] with everything we need and then go and [22:56] take her on a walk so you would have the [22:57] leash in your hand already no you could [23:00] put her on the bed if you want gra the [23:02] leash or you could have the leash in [23:03] your hand but if we know that saying do [23:06] you want to go on a walk triggers that [23:08] excitement and she starts playing that [23:09] game then we'll make sure we have her in [23:11] a position that we can easily control we [23:13] get her geared up and then this will [23:15] become the default behavior before going [23:17] on a walk so she knows okay going on the [23:19] bed I get geared up and then we go on [23:21] our walk so let's take her on a walk [23:23] right now come on baby now before I [23:25] start I like to put the dog into a Sit [23:27] state next to me in heal position before [23:30] stepping I say the heal command so it's [23:33] heal and then step you don't want to say [23:35] heal and step at the same time that's [23:37] another common mistake and one of the [23:39] reasons why is if I teach her that when [23:41] I step she's supposed to step with me [23:44] that means I say heal as I step then [23:46] when I have her in a Sit Stay and I step [23:47] away and I don't want her to come with [23:49] me and she follows me and then I correct [23:51] her for that that would be an unfair [23:52] correction because she would be thinking [23:54] well no I walk with you every time you [23:56] walk because we are pairing the command [23:57] with the physical IAL so we want to make [23:59] sure we say heel then step and if she's [24:03] not in the position I'm just going to [24:04] use the leash to guide her back if she [24:06] goes ahead which she's following me [24:08] nicely good girl so I'm going to use [24:10] verbal praise wrong notice when I said [24:12] wrong come here baby I'm going to guide [24:14] her back right back into heel and then [24:16] loose good girl if she goes too far [24:19] ahead of me wrong then I apply the leash [24:22] now you remember the picture that we did [24:23] earlier good so it's showing her how to [24:25] find that position very easily and if [24:27] she goes behind I would say wrong as [24:29] well wrong another thing that I like to [24:32] do is I try to leave the dog's heel [24:34] position so if she's not paying [24:35] attention to me wrong you see how I step [24:38] out and then also notice how there's no [24:41] pressure on the leash wrong until after [24:44] I say wrong then come on baby then I use [24:47] it and then I go right back to loose [24:49] wrong and it's very important come on [24:52] come on so there's a little bit of that [24:53] resisting you talked about before right [24:56] there you go good girl you have to make [24:58] sure you don't give into that pressure [25:00] wrong come on baby good girl very nice [25:04] excellent we're not going to make much [25:06] wrong much forward Pro good girl and [25:09] remember wrong is just a marker wrong [25:12] she doesn't have a dictionary come here [25:14] baby she doesn't know that I'm saying [25:15] wrong this would be no different than me [25:19] going pancakes good girl you know the [25:22] word doesn't matter as long as we're [25:24] consistent with the word so what's [25:26] really cool about making sure the dog [25:28] understands the communication channels [25:29] as you've already seen we're able to use [25:32] the tools that we developed in order to [25:34] teach her everything we want her to [25:35] perform so we're going to do a little [25:37] bit of obedience out here and you just [25:38] have to think any sort of situation [25:40] you're in all you're really doing when [25:42] it comes to training a dog is telling [25:44] them what you want them to do and then [25:46] showing them how to do it if we look at [25:49] dog training that way if everybody knew [25:51] okay tell my dog what I want show my dog [25:54] how to do it pay my dog for doing it [25:57] everybody can train their dog and you're [25:59] going to see we're going to do some [26:00] basic commands we're going to do sit [26:02] down come heal and then all this [26:04] obedience you want to incorporate [26:06] throughout your life so for example [26:08] you're taking your dog somewhere what [26:10] command can you use to get your dog in [26:11] the vehicle up up exactly that's the [26:15] command you use for the couch you can [26:16] use bed if you wanted to for my dogs I [26:19] use kennel for any room the dog is going [26:22] into so it doesn't even have to be a [26:23] crate if I want them to go into a [26:24] certain room I say go kennel I point and [26:26] they go right to that area so this stuff [26:29] is very very transferable here we go sit [26:33] then the que yes and I'm going to use [26:35] yes and I'm going to reinforce the [26:37] stays come then the [26:41] Q yes then the reward we're going to [26:45] throw a do n down then the [26:51] Q yes then the reward and if she's to [26:54] break at any point I'm going to say [26:55] wrong which is the marker for negative [26:57] reinforcement and I'll use the leash to [26:59] place her back in the position come then [27:02] the que she was ready for that one yes [27:06] then the reward heal then we step back I [27:10] can make her sit if I want yes reward [27:15] Spin and then yes yes and then reward [27:19] good job so now what we're going to do [27:21] is bring her into the heel position so [27:23] you're going to step back with your left [27:24] leg guide her with your left hand and [27:27] get her into the heel there there we go [27:28] good you can use the food to the lure [27:30] that was very nice Mark can reward that [27:32] she looks beautiful make sure the leash [27:33] stays loose unless so now she's there we [27:36] go good job Millie good [27:38] job good job good girl I'm sorry it took [27:42] a little bit of time okay and then see [27:45] how she's starting to go ahead if if she [27:46] does that step back and use the leash CU [27:49] to guide her back into the heel position [27:51] and you can help with the food too and [27:52] then right back into the wall good job [27:54] yes so you don't even have to wait for [27:55] her to sit once she's back in the heel [27:57] you just go right back into the walk you [28:01] okay [28:04] heal yes good job nice job nice walking [28:08] good girl okay Millie let's go this way [28:11] let's go excellent I would Mark and [28:13] reward that too's go I think that was a [28:15] good session let's head back and give [28:16] her a break now all you need to do is [28:19] throughout the day anytime you have her [28:21] with you which is pretty much all the [28:22] time tell her what you want her to do if [28:25] you're going to sit down and watch a [28:26] movie put her on the bed stage or put [28:28] her on the upstate her little section on [28:30] the couch when you're working in your [28:31] office put her in a down next to you and [28:33] we tell our dogs what we want them to do [28:35] it does a few things it increases their [28:37] confidence because they know what to do [28:38] in any given situation but it also helps [28:41] teach them everything that we've been [28:43] working on think about how many [28:45] opportunities you have in a day to tell [28:47] your dog sit without actually having to [28:49] do a formal session you can tell your [28:50] dog sit before you feed him before you [28:52] go through the doorway before you put on [28:53] the collar we can tell our dog down on [28:55] the bed so we can start working all [28:58] these commands without ever having to do [29:01] a formal training session just by [29:03] hanging out with her and remember it's [29:04] the command which is the question and [29:07] then we give her the answer and we [29:09] continue to do that up until the point [29:11] where you ask her a question do you know [29:13] what to do when I say bed and she goes I [29:15] sure do and she runs to her bed then you [29:18] know she now knows it on the verbal [29:20] command and we can just continue to [29:22] reinforce and grow from that point make [29:24] sure when you're training your dog at [29:25] home after you develop those [29:26] communication channels anytime we ask [29:29] our dog to perform a task we want to [29:31] make sure we give them the answer this [29:33] way we can build their confidence and [29:35] ensure that they know what we're asking [29:37] them to perform thanks again for [29:39] watching everyone and we'll see you in [29:41] the next one ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 418/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] so one great form of exercise is [00:02] teaching your dog how to run on [00:03] treadmill it's wonderful look for those [00:04] really rainy days um this treadmill here [00:07] in particular this is a dog pacer this [00:09] treadmill is designed for dogs because [00:12] it's longer [00:13] it has that little incline on it and has [00:15] this bar right here which makes it [00:16] really easy to put an attachment onto so [00:19] you can use a regular human treadmill [00:22] you do not have to use a dog treadmill [00:24] for years i would just get a free [00:25] treadmill off craigslist and i would get [00:27] my dogs around that okay so you don't [00:29] have to have a fancy dog treadmill i'm [00:30] just a fancy dog trainer and i like [00:31] fancy stuff but you can really use [00:33] anything um well any kind of human [00:35] treadmill so [00:37] first things first you have to teach [00:39] your dog a place if your dog doesn't [00:40] know how to place you can't teach them [00:41] run on on the treadmill my opinion place [00:44] should be like the very first thing a [00:45] dog is taught because it helps teach a [00:46] lot other behaviors such as this and [00:48] down stays and all sorts of fun things [00:50] but yeah we want to get the dog to be [00:52] comfortable and confident on a place yes [00:55] when the dog is confident in this [00:56] command and comfortable with it they can [00:58] maintain it [01:00] that is when i'm going to now introduce [01:02] the treadmill as a place now many of you [01:05] may need to use a leash initially to [01:07] guide your dog onto it i am going to [01:09] just use this little pull tab here it's [01:11] just a little braided [01:13] a little braided leather with a [01:15] leak snap on it so [01:17] um [01:18] many of you will need to help your dog [01:20] onto it with the leash to be some [01:22] guidance you're also going to want some [01:24] food monster free [01:25] so [01:26] place [01:28] a safe place i may need to lure her [01:29] right onto here she went right on she's [01:31] used to this she's ran on here many [01:33] times so she's like what are you doing [01:34] mom yes [01:35] but for most dogs you might even have to [01:37] put some food on here but use the leash [01:39] to guide them onto it [01:41] if your dog is a little bit worried it's [01:43] okay help them out with some more food [01:45] high value rewards i've used peanut [01:47] butter for this for a lot of dogs so [01:48] that way it helps distract them from [01:50] being nervous so i'll use some peanut [01:52] butter and then i'll use the leash so [01:53] that way they don't try to move away [01:55] from it right get them onto here free [01:58] release them off of it okay and then we [02:00] do it again [02:01] monster [02:02] come [02:03] right here [02:06] yeah i'm just going to help around [02:07] good girl [02:09] place we get it right on [02:11] walk her up onto it yes [02:13] mark reward [02:16] free very nice so when the dog is [02:19] confidently [02:20] come on man [02:21] jumping onto the treadmill like it's a [02:23] place and wanting to stay on to here [02:25] just like monster yes [02:27] this is where i'm going to move on to [02:28] the next step so the next step is [02:30] getting the dog used to the sound [02:33] of the treadmill okay i'm gonna get her [02:35] off of it onto the place and i'm gonna [02:38] let her hear it the reason why i do this [02:40] next rather than first is because it [02:43] might freak the dog out at first and [02:45] they might want to avoid this right [02:46] whereas if the dog is used to this [02:48] object and just hears it while it's neck [02:50] while the dog's next to it it's more [02:52] likely that they're going to be more [02:54] comfortable with that because they've [02:55] already been on it they already know [02:56] what it is it's not just some random [02:58] thing making spooky sounds monster free [03:00] so i'm going to go put it right here [03:02] stay [03:04] and i'm just going to turn the treadmill [03:06] on [03:07] and it's going to move and i'm just [03:08] going to get her used to hearing that [03:10] because it does make some sounds some [03:12] dogs are very sensitive to the sounds [03:13] other dogs don't really care [03:15] yes if if i have a dog that's a little [03:17] nervous i'm going to be right here yes [03:20] i'm going to be paying them [03:21] yes as they're hearing the sound the [03:23] treadmill this one's pretty quiet right [03:24] now it's actually normally a bit louder [03:27] but the dog is totally fine hey you see [03:29] that track it's moving you hear those [03:31] sounds it's making some noises um and [03:34] the dog's fine that is where i'm now [03:36] going to get them onto the treadmill and [03:38] turn it on okay so we'll turn this off [03:42] monster free [03:44] good girl monster place [03:47] not that one i'll help you she's like i [03:49] think i'm supposed to go this one come [03:51] on baby good girl place very nice so i [03:54] get my dog onto the treadmill here and [03:56] you're going to want some kind of way to [03:59] hook your dog onto here okay and then [04:01] i'm going to be right here next to my [04:04] dog helping them through this process [04:06] because your dog's probably going to get [04:07] nervous at first it's normal [04:10] it is something new anytime the dog is [04:12] introduced to something brand new [04:13] there's going to be element to [04:14] nervousness or stress with that as long [04:16] as we keep it short and sweet and the [04:18] dog ends with a good attitude we're good [04:21] so this is just going to be a very quick [04:22] thing with your dogs i would make it [04:24] super fast as well just a few seconds of [04:26] them and and of moving on to the [04:28] treadmill just getting that walking [04:30] motion okay we're not running yet we're [04:32] not pushing the dogs it's just oh yeah [04:34] it moves now good job you're done okay [04:37] so i'm going to turn it on [04:40] and i'm going to be right here with her [04:42] yes if i had a brand new dog right this [04:45] is where i would be i would be helping [04:47] them out yes [04:48] and if that dog was moving very nicely [04:51] like she is [04:52] i'm going to get the dog off of it it's [04:54] very likely your dogs might be like oh [04:57] no it's moving and go limp right that's [04:59] a very normal thing that's where i might [05:01] just support the dog until they do a [05:03] couple steps then i'll turn it off and [05:06] then we would be done [05:08] monster free [05:09] just like that and i always release the [05:11] dog off the front of the treadmill okay [05:14] not off the back of the treadmill this [05:16] way they understand the flow and how it [05:17] works versus i'm just going to put the [05:20] brakes on and i'll eventually get off [05:21] that way right so we want to make sure [05:23] the dog's getting off here so we'll do [05:25] another one of those this time we're [05:26] going to increase some speed so let's [05:28] say you've been doing that with your dog [05:30] and your dog's now starting to get [05:32] confident with it moving at that really [05:34] slow pace we're going to increase some [05:36] speed okay monster are you hanging out [05:38] with nate [05:40] she's like yeah i'm gonna hang out here [05:43] good girl she's like i'm getting tired [05:44] monster come [05:46] good girl [05:48] place [05:49] get her right on the treadmill here good [05:51] girl she's gonna walk right up to here [05:53] good job [05:56] hook her up [05:59] turn it on [06:02] good [06:03] it's going at this point your dog is [06:05] confidently walking [06:07] i'm gonna relieve this they're a little [06:09] bit too tight right there you don't want [06:10] to be that tight there we go [06:12] and now i'm gonna increase the speed [06:16] just to a nice [06:18] walk right if your dog's walking really [06:21] nicely like this perfect have them on [06:23] here for five minutes maybe ten that's [06:27] where i would definitely cut it off take [06:29] them off and you know let them relax [06:31] okay [06:32] over time you can work up to your dog [06:34] running on the treadmill after they're [06:36] very confident and comfortable with [06:37] walking on it just like monsters you can [06:39] start to increase speed now some dogs if [06:42] you start to increase speed too much or [06:43] too fast they're going to [06:45] be at the very end of the treadmill and [06:48] going to try it be putting ass little [06:49] effort into it to follow the track [06:51] that's where you definitely want to go [06:52] slower with those dogs there's other [06:54] dogs out there they will be running at [06:56] the edge right here or right at the very [06:59] top and for those dogs i turn up the [07:01] speed i actually have some dogs that [07:03] will try to do it themselves they'll [07:04] actually whack right here usually [07:06] uh huskies i had one his name was dandy [07:09] he was obsessed with it he would hit his [07:11] pawn over and over again [07:13] but yeah eventually you can get your dog [07:14] jogging this one here you can have like [07:16] a little program set to it [07:18] other ones you can set the incline and [07:20] change it around good girl [07:24] good girl but always watch your dog when [07:26] they're on the treadmill never leave a [07:28] dog unattended on a treadmill good job [07:30] baby [07:32] nice job [07:33] so as you can see she's super confident [07:35] this is a good speed for her um [07:37] maximum amount of time i've put my dogs [07:39] on a treadmill for i would say it's like [07:40] 30 minutes after 30 minutes i typically [07:42] take them off every dog is different [07:45] and i'll go ahead and shut it off [07:47] good girl [07:49] very nice [07:51] and then unhook her [07:53] and then release her monster free now [07:56] plenty of dogs can run without this [07:58] eventually she definitely can in the [08:00] beginning i would have this on them just [08:02] in case they try to jump off this way or [08:04] try to freeze up and fall off the track [08:06] um but over time you don't even need [08:08] this on here and the dog can go on here [08:10] and run all right but yeah that's how [08:13] you teach your dog how to run on a [08:14] treadmill super useful behavior to teach [08:17] i recommend it

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 421/841,com/@nateschoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] last session we worked on engagement [00:02] training with jax we're using yes as the [00:04] continuation marker free as the terminal [00:06] marker we did luring which he was [00:09] struggling a little bit since he didn't [00:11] have that much food drive but you've [00:12] been working on his food drive and then [00:14] we also introduced him to leash pressure [00:17] how's that training going and do you [00:19] know if he's fully conditioned to the [00:20] markers yet [00:21] uh it's going well um i would say he is [00:24] conditioned to the markers uh he [00:25] understands what yes means and free for [00:28] the terminal uh having a little issues [00:30] with the leash pressure at some points [00:33] being a little stubborn okay no problem [00:36] so we'll do a training session i think [00:38] that's going to be a good start we'll go [00:40] over the markers again just to make sure [00:42] we're doing it right and do you remember [00:44] the four most common change of behaviors [00:46] that a dog has when they're conditioned [00:48] to the marker [00:49] no [00:50] so it's licking their lips opening their [00:52] mouth salivating or moving their paws a [00:56] great way to test out to make sure your [00:58] dog is conditioned i just get the dog in [01:00] front of me i have the treats i wait [01:02] till the dog looks up at me i say the [01:04] marker and then i don't reward the dog [01:06] right away and i watch to see if there's [01:08] a change of behavior and if the dog's [01:10] conditioned the most common is they open [01:13] their mouth because in anticipation of [01:15] that reward coming we'll work with the [01:17] luring a little bit make sure he's [01:18] following the food nicely and then you [01:20] said he's struggling a little bit with [01:22] the leash pressure just a little bit [01:23] okay cool and least pressure is usually [01:25] difficult for most dogs so we'll do that [01:28] and then i know you said you're [01:29] struggling with another issue that you [01:31] wanted to address and you want to work [01:32] on today right that was that was begging [01:34] i wanted to [01:36] whenever we're eating or he wants food [01:38] he starts to beg and we're trying to get [01:40] him out of that habit okay perfect and [01:42] that's a real common problem that a lot [01:44] of people run into the nice thing is [01:46] dogs aren't actually begging it appears [01:49] that they're begging but what do we do [01:51] when we want a dog to train we get the [01:53] treat pouch and we pull out food and we [01:56] ask the dog to look at us in order to [01:58] get the food right the dog looks at us [02:00] we give the dog the food so then when we [02:01] sit down to eat our own meal the dog [02:03] acts out that behavior the dog comes [02:05] over and says hey last time you had food [02:08] i sat i looked up at you you gave me [02:11] some of the food so what's up [02:13] and then we tell the dog stop begging [02:15] well that can be a little bit confusing [02:18] so what i like to do in this situation [02:20] instead of trying to stop the dog from [02:21] begging because we actually want that [02:23] behavior when we have food when we're [02:25] training and it can be a little bit [02:27] confusing for dogs so instead of [02:29] worrying about that we're going to [02:30] direct them to a different behavior [02:32] which my favorite go to is the climb [02:35] command if i sit down to eat i have my [02:37] dogs go to their climb platform which is [02:39] just an elevated bed you guys have one [02:41] right yes a nice elevated bed that's the [02:43] dog's place while we're eating so you [02:46] have to have a place command and then we [02:48] have to have a good stay command and [02:50] we'll work on that so [02:51] redirecting to the behavior you want is [02:54] one of the best ways to work on any sort [02:57] of behavioral issue if our dogs know [02:59] what they're supposed to do in a given [03:00] situation then it increases their [03:03] confidence it reduces the problems that [03:05] we're having and it gives our dog a very [03:07] clear path to success so i have a quick [03:09] question i know he has his puppy teeth [03:11] right now but when his adult teeth come [03:13] in what's your best strategy to keep [03:14] them white and healthy that's a good [03:16] question what i like to do for my dogs [03:18] is i give them raw bones probably about [03:21] once every two weeks so you can start [03:23] doing that right now with the raw meat [03:25] dogs love it [03:26] once he's at six months of age and his [03:28] adult teeth come in though and i started [03:29] using it recently my dogs love it their [03:32] breath is better and their teeth are [03:33] whiter and it's called bark brite lucky [03:36] for you fixing dog breath is as easy as [03:38] giving your dog their favorite treat [03:41] with bark bright dental kits every good [03:43] dog owner knows good health starts with [03:46] excellent dental health and with this [03:49] simple change in your dog's oral hygiene [03:51] routine you can make a transformative [03:54] impact not just with bad breath but by [03:57] helping fight plaque and tartar too my [04:00] dogs love it and i'm sure yours will too [04:03] bright box products are easy to use they [04:05] promote a healthy routine for your pup [04:08] and provide tremendous benefits to you

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 422/841,com [04:34] backslash bright dental backslash nate [04:38] you'll be glad you did all right so the [04:39] very first step engagement training i [04:41] know you said he's engaged but we're [04:43] just going to do a couple as a refresher [04:44] for him remember we take the food we [04:47] hold it up by our face yes and then we [04:49] deliver the reward i'm not going to give [04:50] him the reward while he's jumping up [04:55] so now this is a common problem puppies [04:57] or dogs jumping up to get the food the [04:59] way i like to fix this is i'll slowly [05:01] start to lower my hand and if the pup [05:03] jumps up i move it away so i slowly [05:06] start to lower [05:07] and if he jumps up i move away and each [05:10] time he's sitting [05:12] the food comes to him [05:17] good boy come on bk [05:20] very nice good boy [05:24] he's not even paying attention [05:31] and if he stays sitting [05:33] then the food comes to him so he learns [05:35] jumping up [05:37] makes the food go away [05:38] whereas sitting brings the food directly [05:41] to him [05:45] and he's already figured it out [05:48] good boy [05:49] very nice [05:50] okay so now i'm gonna go back to the [05:52] markers [05:53] free and then we move back good job [05:56] buddy i can give him verbal praise [05:58] remember we like to switch hands [06:01] yes [06:03] very good [06:10] free [06:11] excellent work very nice [06:14] good boy so again the main things we're [06:16] doing is we want him to look up at us [06:18] and we can even get down to his level [06:21] yes [06:22] and i'm not gonna reward when he jumps [06:24] yes [06:26] making sure that we say the word free [06:29] before we move [06:32] so let's have you do a couple with him [06:33] okay [06:35] yes [06:37] excellent your timing's really nice so [06:39] now we're going to do some learning do [06:40] you have any other questions about [06:42] engagement training uh not at the moment [06:44] i think [06:45] if something comes up i'll ask and one [06:46] of the things that i like to do so when [06:48] i first start training a dog we use [06:50] what's known as continual reinforcement [06:52] we're rewarding every single correct [06:53] repetition and because of that we go [06:56] through a lot of treats now we're using [06:58] his food which is exactly the way that i [07:00] like to do that i know we went over that [07:01] the first time but just to repeat it so [07:03] i bring the dog out before starting any [07:05] obedience session i'll do maybe 30 [07:08] seconds of engagement training okay [07:09] because the more engaged i can have the [07:11] dog the faster they're going to learn [07:14] so now with step two we're just gonna [07:15] start luring him around make sure he's [07:17] following the food what's nice about [07:19] this step is you don't have to mark if [07:22] you don't want to although i do [07:24] recommend using your marker the reason [07:26] why is when a dog does something we're [07:28] trying to capture we have to let the dog [07:30] know within one second of them doing the [07:32] behavior now if we can't see what you [07:34] mean by him being a little lazy come on [07:35] buddy so if i lift up his butt touches [07:38] the ground i can easily give him the [07:39] food within a second of doing the [07:41] behavior we're trying to capture and [07:43] since we're not giving any verbal [07:44] commands there's no stay so i can just [07:47] lure him around and just keep giving him [07:49] food [07:51] no problem but i do recommend practicing [07:54] the markers just to work on your timing [07:55] a little bit again because watch how [07:57] fast i can give him the food the second [07:58] his butt hits the ground i'm able to [08:00] give him the food but again we want to [08:02] work on practicing saying the marker [08:06] yes and releasing now remember during [08:09] this step [08:11] it matter if you use your continuation [08:13] marker yes or your terminal marker free [08:15] does it matter no it does not why [08:18] because either way he's getting a reward [08:20] and he's not in a stay right so we don't [08:22] really care about which marker we use [08:24] until we start incorporating the command [08:27] and we start reinforcing the stay but [08:29] right now since i'm not saying [08:31] down to get them to go into the position [08:33] there's no down stay therefore it [08:36] doesn't matter which marker we use so [08:38] since you're having the issue with [08:39] begging we're going to use the climb [08:41] command so i want to make sure we can [08:42] get him to go on it come on big guy [08:44] come on buddy very nice yes and then [08:47] reward and it's also nice to lure him [08:49] off [08:50] yes reward let's get this sit sitting [08:53] there yes [08:55] and i'm marking [08:57] once he does the behavior so we're [08:59] looking at the completion yes and reward [09:01] and let's get a spin in there as well [09:03] come on be gay [09:05] yes that's just for fun we want to make [09:07] the training as fun and interesting as [09:09] possible let's try to get him in the [09:10] heel position and he's a little pup so [09:12] we're going to keep this nice and short [09:15] yes and reward excellent so [09:19] sit down spin whatever you want to do [09:21] but the main thing is going to be the [09:22] climb and having them come off the climb [09:25] so what i'm going to do now that we are [09:27] incorporating the command [09:29] come on buddy i'm going to make sure i [09:31] say the command then i'm going to guide [09:32] him onto the little climb bed and it [09:35] doesn't matter where you are some people [09:37] feel like they need to be right next to [09:39] the climb when they start teaching it [09:40] you could be anywhere so i could be [09:41] right here and i can say climb [09:44] and now i'm going to guide him [09:47] yes now he's on a climb stay and now i'm [09:50] watching him the moment he breaks [09:52] i'll say one wrong and i'll place him [09:53] back on [09:56] yes if he holds it nicely i'm going to [09:58] use the continuation marker and i'm [10:00] going to reinforce that behavior i'm [10:02] going to drop the leash yes go back and [10:04] reward [10:06] add a little bit more distance [10:09] yes since he's staying on the position [10:13] add more distance [10:16] yes very good he's going to make this [10:18] easy now i'm just going to start walking [10:20] around the room [10:24] [Music] [10:29] yes [10:30] wrong [10:31] a wrong can override a yes [10:33] we casually bring him back [10:35] very good good boy no reward [10:38] wrong [10:42] good [10:44] if he holds it for about five seconds [10:47] then i can mark for duration [10:49] so now he's been holding it for at least [10:50] five seconds yes [10:52] and now i can reward [10:54] and that was long enough of a time span [10:56] away from him breaking the position that [10:58] we are not rewarding him for placing him [11:00] back but we were rewarding him for [11:02] maintaining the position [11:04] yes [11:04] good boy [11:06] very nice [11:08] build more distance now dogs will often [11:10] break when we squat down because we [11:13] usually use that as a technique to call [11:15] them to us so this is a good way to work [11:17] on that as well so i'll squat down [11:19] wrong if he breaks i just say the one [11:22] wrong [11:23] and i bring him back [11:25] good boy very nice [11:28] wrong [11:32] very good buddy [11:35] wrong [11:36] and you have to be ready to continue to [11:38] do it sometimes you may feel like a [11:39] broken record [11:42] yes [11:43] very good nice job i'm gonna grab a [11:47] couple more pieces [11:51] also when you first start teaching a [11:53] stay command [11:55] a good rule to follow is if you can't [11:58] touch your pup [11:59] don't free them up [12:01] for about two weeks at least the reason [12:04] why is dogs are creatures of habit if [12:06] you start teaching a stay and then [12:09] walking 10 feet away and calling him to [12:11] you or releasing him [12:13] after enough of those when you get about [12:15] 10 feet away what do you think he's [12:16] going to do he's going to automatically [12:18] exactly he's going to release himself so [12:21] if we start the foundation of any time [12:23] we release him we're close enough to [12:24] touch him then he's going to think that [12:26] you have to be next to him in order for [12:28] him to be released and it just really [12:30] helps solidify the stay command so i'm [12:32] going to release him he's doing a great [12:33] job and i'm going to use the terminal [12:35] marker you could release him by saying a [12:37] release word such as break which would [12:40] such as break which just means release [12:43] it doesn't guarantee a reward as the [12:45] terminal marker does [12:47] free [12:48] come on buddy good boy very nice and now [12:52] we're gonna have you do it okay climb [12:55] much better [12:58] good turn off the pressure [13:01] and something that i do that helps the [13:03] dog a little bit when we're guiding them [13:04] let me show you real quick [13:07] oops [13:08] when i start to guide them i'll keep my [13:10] hand at their level okay so this makes [13:13] it a little bit easier for him to fall [13:15] good boy [13:17] instead of holding it high up so if you [13:19] hold it on an angle and you're pulling [13:21] that could slightly confuse them [13:23] sometimes and make them think that we [13:24] want them to sit [13:29] yes [13:36] and now technically he's actually not on [13:38] a climb stay because i cued him off and [13:40] i cued him back on without saying [13:43] and if that happens if you're not sure [13:45] whether or not your dog's in a stay then [13:47] all i do for that is i just let him know [13:49] that he's now in that position without [13:50] saying stay because i like the implied [13:53] stay so i just go climb [13:55] good boy [13:56] and now it's a climb stay even though he [13:58] doesn't fully understand it yet the more [14:01] we incorporate that into the training [14:02] the more he'll start to understand it [14:04] all right [14:05] yes [14:06] good boy buddy [14:11] and then if you want to try to squat [14:12] down perfect [14:14] yes [14:18] good job jax good job [14:22] try coming over here [14:26] yes [14:30] good job buddy there you go [14:36] excellent he's doing really nice [14:38] yes [14:43] good job jax [14:46] yes [14:51] good job [14:52] now what's great about dogs is they're [14:54] very situational so if you have a [14:56] certain routine you've probably already [14:58] seen it like if the first thing you do [15:00] in the morning is you take him out to go [15:01] to the bathroom he's expecting that when [15:03] you first wake up if you feed him first [15:05] thing in the morning he's expecting to [15:06] be fed first thing in the morning [15:08] they're very good at recognizing [15:10] patterns and situations so what you can [15:12] do with meal time you said when people [15:14] start either prepping the table or once [15:16] they sit down he's running over he's [15:18] saying you guys got food i sit you give [15:20] me food what's up [15:21] and he doesn't understand that that's [15:23] not his place to be in that position so [15:25] what you can do is you can sit down [15:27] right after you sit down that's your cue [15:29] or once you start prepping the table [15:31] whatever it is as long as you have some [15:33] sort of physical cue [15:35] that represents him going to the climb [15:37] and you just create a pattern so start [15:39] prepping the table [15:41] place him on the climb or sit down place [15:44] him on the climb what will end up [15:45] happening is he'll start to recognize [15:47] that and when you start prepping the [15:49] table he will go to his climb bed on his [15:51] own that will basically become a [15:54] non-verbal command just like the [15:55] automatic sit when halted how do we [15:57] teach that we slow down we stop and then [16:00] we make the dog sit we can tell them to [16:01] sit we can use the leash to to sit [16:04] we can use a food lure it doesn't matter [16:06] but if every single time we stop and we [16:08] tell our dog to sit after enough of [16:10] those when we stop our dog will [16:12] automatically sit so this is the exact [16:14] same concept so you can use a command [16:17] too so for example you're prepping the [16:18] table you place your food down once you [16:20] place your food down i would go climb [16:23] and then i'd walk over [16:25] grab them and i'd guide them over on the [16:28] climb [16:29] very good nice job buddy and then i [16:32] would go and sit down now of course once [16:35] you first start doing this he's gonna [16:36] know it's a little bit different than a [16:37] training session and he's gonna break [16:39] more so you can either set it up as a [16:42] training session get a plate of food set [16:43] it down and expect that it might get [16:45] cold and then go through this because [16:47] he's gonna break more once you sit down [16:49] wrong you just have to make sure you [16:50] follow through usually a couple sessions [16:53] of that [16:54] and every time you sit down he'll [16:56] maintain that position and now instead [16:58] of worrying about [16:59] wrong [17:01] worrying about him begging or practicing [17:03] a behavior you don't want him to [17:04] continue as he gets older [17:06] he now knows when you sit down that's [17:10] his place to be wrong and i like to do [17:12] this with everything i mean i use the [17:13] climb for so many different [17:15] situations for example if i'm sitting [17:17] down and i'm responding to emails come [17:19] on buddy good boy very nice i have my [17:24] dogs on a climb when i'm in the [17:26] backyard let's say i'm in the backyard [17:28] reading or something like that the dogs [17:30] are on a climb what other questions do [17:32] you have is there anything else that you [17:33] wanted to go over today oh that was good [17:35] for yeah i mean it's enough for him [17:37] right for where he's at [17:39] so big thing is [17:41] make sure you do about 30 seconds of [17:43] that engagement training before each [17:44] session you feed them twice a day three [17:47] times three times a day that's three [17:48] training sessions each day if you don't [17:51] have time if you're busy you're getting [17:52] ready to run out the door i would still [17:55] use that as an opportunity but what i [17:58] might do i'm just gonna do one handful [18:00] let's say i have his entire bowl of food [18:01] right here i might ask for one behavior [18:04] and give him an entire handful and i can [18:06] get through a session in one to two [18:08] minutes but he's still working for every [18:10] bite which greatly increases that food [18:12] drive which makes the training [18:13] significantly easier because as we [18:15] already know reward based training is [18:17] limited by how much the dog wants the [18:19] reward so if we can increase the value [18:22] of the reward the training becomes that [18:24] much easier because a dog that wants [18:26] what we have [18:27] is willing to do the behaviors we're [18:29] asking them to perform and then the [18:31] luring is looking really nice so i keep [18:33] working on that and i'd really focus [18:35] more on that leash pressure get it to [18:36] the point where he knows resisting [18:38] doesn't work [18:39] and if he does start to resist make sure [18:41] that doesn't work for him stay strong [18:43] once he complies release that pressure [18:45] good boy nice job and always end on a [18:48] good note short sessions and you should [18:49] be good sounds good all right thank you [18:51] so much all right no other questions no [18:53] i think we're good sounds good then good [18:55] seeing you again ==================================================

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 425/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] happy saturday everybody [00:02] um [00:03] sorry i'm running a little bit behind [00:04] today i was trying to find or get my mic [00:08] rather but unfortunately i failed to [00:10] charge it the other day so hopefully the [00:12] audio sounds okay [00:13] all right first one is how do we get a [00:16] better form with post [00:18] the stand command please describe steps [00:21] of the process we're not ready for [00:22] shaping box yet she confused hand signal [00:25] with touch so she's coming towards me [00:27] and doesn't always stand straight and [00:29] center [00:30] well when i'm teaching the stand command [00:33] of course we want to be able to present [00:35] a physical cue that's going to guarantee [00:37] our dog's going to do the behavior [00:40] now if we take the food and we guide it [00:42] towards our dog's chest [00:44] usually their back end is going to pop [00:47] up this doesn't always happen though [00:49] especially if you started off teaching [00:52] your dog how to walk backwards they may [00:54] want to walk backwards or they may think [00:56] you're trying to cue them into a down [00:58] since your hand is starting to go below [01:01] their [01:03] eyesight or their nose level and that's [01:04] usually when they think they're going [01:06] into a down position so sometimes what i [01:08] might do is i might help the dog a [01:09] little bit with my hand and some dogs [01:12] when they jump up into the stand they [01:14] may choose to jump to the right or [01:16] slightly to the left if that happens if [01:18] i notice my dog is jumping up but to the [01:21] right when they go into the stand [01:22] position then i'm gonna place a wall or [01:24] i'm gonna put my dog rather next to a [01:26] wall so when i cue him or her into the [01:29] stand position the wall is going to [01:31] prevent them from moving to the side [01:34] again we can also help with our hand [01:36] another option is to teach your dog a [01:39] belly band a belly band is where we use [01:42] a collar to put it around the dog's [01:44] waist and then we treat that or we teach [01:47] the dog how to respond to the pressure [01:50] the same way we would when we're doing [01:52] leash pressure training so what i mean [01:54] by that when we start to apply leash [01:57] pressure remember in order for leash [01:59] pressure which [02:00] i believe it should be called a leash [02:02] cue [02:03] in order for that to work two things [02:05] must take place number one once the [02:07] pressure's turned on it cannot be turned [02:10] off until the dog complies and number [02:12] two the moment the dog complies it has [02:15] to instantly be turned off it's the same [02:18] thing when we're doing leash pressure [02:20] around the dog's waist it helps teach [02:22] the dog to pop up their back end when [02:25] we're teaching our dog leash pressure [02:27] remember we're presenting our dog with a [02:29] problem [02:30] and if we want to reduce the stress [02:33] associated with that type of training [02:36] what we want to do is we want to give [02:38] our dog the answer so if you know how i [02:41] do my leash training process i start the [02:44] pressure [02:45] that's the problem then i give the dog [02:48] the answer by luring them into the [02:50] desired position so for example if i [02:53] wanted to get my dog to go into a sit [02:56] with leash pressure and i'm teaching my [02:58] dog leash pressure i'll lift up with the [03:00] leash ever so slightly [03:02] then i will take the food and i'll lure [03:05] the dog into the sit the moment the dog [03:08] sits i turn off the pressure and i give [03:10] the dog the reward [03:12] we can do the same thing if we're [03:13] teaching our dog how to respond to a [03:15] belly band in fact i think i demonstrate [03:18] that in my [03:20] how to teach your dog to stand video [03:22] it's another option to help make sure [03:24] the dog [03:25] stands correctly and maintains the [03:27] position [03:28] i also have a video on [03:32] teaching the stand for exam for akc [03:34] obedience that process will also help [03:36] when teaching the stan command okay next [03:39] question and um [03:41] by the way i have to go through my [03:43] channel member questions first once i [03:46] answer all those then i'll start jumping [03:48] to the other questions [03:50] so the next one is i live in an [03:52] apartment and i need my puppy to be able [03:54] to go to the bathroom inside and out [03:57] she has got the going outside down [03:59] pretty good i just don't know how to [04:01] train her for the inside as well also [04:04] i'm in nursing school she'll be 18 19 [04:07] weeks when i start again do i need to [04:09] get a sitter for her thank you so much [04:11] for your help okay um so teaching a dog [04:14] to go to the bathroom inside if you [04:17] already taught your dog to go to the [04:19] bathroom outside and they think that's [04:21] the only place they're supposed to go to [04:22] the bathroom if you watch my video on [04:26] teaching the brilliant pad so the [04:27] brilliant pad it's an excellent [04:30] potty system [04:32] if you have a dog that needs to go to [04:34] the bathroom inside whether you live in [04:37] an apartment and you can't always find [04:39] the time to take the dog outside [04:41] brilliant pad is a great option it can [04:43] sense the dog going to the bathroom when [04:45] the dog leaves it wraps it up [04:47] automatically removing any odor any [04:50] smell but if you watch that video you'll [04:52] see how i start with a dog that [04:55] goes to the bathroom outside you find [04:57] the spot that your dog goes to the [04:59] bathroom and then you place the [05:00] brilliant pad there if you're using [05:02] something like potty pads you can do the [05:04] same thing to make it more clear what i [05:07] like to do is get a storage container [05:10] one that's not very deep maybe four to [05:12] six inches but it's wider so it's almost [05:15] like using [05:16] it's almost like a cat litter box i [05:18] guess you could say but it's a little [05:19] bit bigger so i use it for [05:21] small dogs if i'm teaching them to go on [05:24] potty pads [05:25] the reason why if you've had a smaller [05:28] dog any of you had a small dog and [05:30] you're teaching that dog or a puppy to [05:32] use a potty pad which again if we're [05:34] using a potty pad remember you are [05:36] teaching your dog to go to the bathroom [05:38] inside the house if that's what you want [05:40] and that's [05:42] more feasible to your living situation [05:44] then there's nothing wrong with that if [05:46] you want your dog if you want your dog [05:48] to go to the bathroom outside then i [05:49] recommend not using potty pads but a [05:52] puppy or a dog might smell the potty pad [05:54] and then they go pee or number two and [05:57] they think they're going on the pad but [05:59] they're missing the pad entirely so by [06:02] using [06:03] this storage style container taking the [06:05] lid off maybe it's four inches deep six [06:08] inches deep something like that and i [06:09] place the potty pads in there the dog [06:11] has to jump in the container in order to [06:13] go to the bathroom so the likelihood of [06:16] them missing [06:17] is much lower than what it was before [06:20] so then with that as the dog starts to [06:23] understand going in that container [06:25] outside if your dog is so used to going [06:27] outside gradually over time i slowly [06:30] move it closer and closer to being [06:31] inside and usually that'll help the dog [06:34] go to the bathroom another option if you [06:36] don't have the time to do the process [06:38] like that what i would do is in the [06:40] morning when i have to take the dog [06:43] to go to the bathroom and we know the [06:44] dog has to go to the bathroom i would [06:46] take the dog to the indoor potty [06:48] location i would set the dog in the [06:50] potty location and i would wait three [06:52] minutes the same way [06:54] or the same process i would follow when [06:56] i'm teaching a dog to go to the bathroom [06:58] outside i wait three minutes if the dog [07:00] goes to the bathroom yay good job pet [07:03] the dog and then i'll do something that [07:04] the dog enjoys whether that's going on a [07:07] walk playing with some toys doing some [07:09] obedience training i'm gonna let the dog [07:11] know that going to the bathroom predicts [07:14] an activity that is more enjoyable if [07:17] the dog doesn't go to the bathroom in [07:19] those three minutes no big deal i pick [07:21] them up i place them back inside of [07:23] their kennel or crate and then i simply [07:28] then i simply wait [07:30] another 20 minutes i take the dog back [07:33] out i repeat the process and i continue [07:36] to do that until the dog goes to the [07:37] bathroom since the dog already has to go [07:40] to the bathroom in the morning then [07:42] that's a great opportunity in order to [07:44] teach the dog to go to the bathroom in [07:45] the container okay [07:48] uh let's see squirrel and small mammal [07:50] desensitization luna has strong prey dry [07:53] for ground squirrels and cats if i catch [07:55] it in time i can make her sit she keeps [07:58] eyes locked on and is so [08:01] attracted or so active her whole body [08:03] shakes how do i [08:06] progress with this to reduce her [08:07] interest and reactivity i'd like to be [08:10] able to put her in a down and have a [08:12] squirrel run by her without her [08:14] twitching and bringing her hats and and [08:17] bring her around house cats safely okay [08:20] so if we're working on getting a dog [08:23] desensitized to small mammals [08:26] that's going to be a process that will [08:28] take a time that will take time [08:29] especially if the dog has very high prey [08:33] drive [08:34] so some dogs that have high prey drive a [08:36] good way to look at it if you watch my [08:38] video on [08:39] generalizing your dog and socializing [08:42] them or grading them if i start working [08:44] so you want to think about what's the [08:46] easiest environment to train our dogs in [08:49] well an environment a completely empty [08:51] room that's going to be the best [08:54] environment to start training a dog in [08:56] because you don't have to compete with [08:58] any additional motivating factors you're [09:01] the only thing in the room and so you [09:03] become more interesting because there's [09:05] nothing in order for you to compete with [09:08] once i get the dog pretty good in that [09:11] information once i get the dog pretty [09:13] good in that [09:14] situation then i can gradually start to [09:17] make it more difficult so [09:21] let's look at it this way when we're [09:22] thinking about the concept of getting a [09:24] dog generalized to something [09:26] it's usually around eight or nine of [09:29] whatever it is that you're working [09:30] towards in order to get the dog [09:32] generalized [09:33] this is why competition obedience dog [09:36] trainers they train at multiple [09:38] locations so when they go compete the [09:40] dog is generalized and they know they [09:42] have to do the obedience regardless of [09:45] where they are and that's very important [09:47] if you want reliability for your dog's [09:49] training so what i like to do is i'll [09:51] teach my dog in a neutral environment [09:54] all the basic obedience i'll go through [09:56] the first few steps engagement training [09:59] luring leash pressure [10:01] teaching the commands working on the [10:03] stay once i feel like i have a good [10:05] foundation then i'm going to start [10:07] introducing environments that are more [10:09] difficult if i notice i start training [10:12] my dog in an environment that is too [10:15] difficult for my dog i'm going to make [10:17] sure i end on a good note then i'm gonna [10:19] go to an environment that's much easier [10:22] and work my way back up to where i was [10:25] so don't rush the training process when [10:28] it comes to new environments and the new [10:30] environments includes [10:32] small mammals so if i'm trying to train [10:34] a dog that's still very new in the [10:36] training [10:37] and i'm trying to work obedience at a [10:41] park on a saturday where people are [10:43] barbecuing you have animals running [10:46] around other dogs barking working a down [10:49] stay with those distractions is going to [10:51] be very difficult for a dog that is [10:53] early on in the training so progress at [10:56] the speed in which your dog is getting [10:58] proficient at and gradually make it more [11:01] difficult but again if you notice it's [11:03] too hard for your dog go back a little [11:05] bit and work your way up that's really a [11:07] big part of that concept of [11:09] desensitization with anything that it is [11:11] that we're trying to get our dogs [11:12] desensitized to we introduce it at a [11:15] very low stimuli and we gradually [11:17] increase that stimuli as the dog becomes [11:20] better [11:22] okay i have a herding dog gracie most [11:25] australian cattle dog mostly australian [11:27] cattle dog german shepherd she tends to [11:29] hurt my [11:31] other dog anyway to get her to stop [11:33] hurting okay so that is going to look at [11:37] behavioral issues so when we're working [11:38] on behavioral issues [11:41] we have two main issues when it comes to [11:43] working with our dogs we have obedience [11:45] issues and we have behavioral issues for [11:48] obedience issues we only have two that [11:50] we have to worry about a dog not staying [11:52] in a stay and a dog not doing a [11:54] commanded behavior for behavioral issues [11:57] we have five main behavioral issues that [11:59] we have to focus on and it's very easy [12:01] to remember these we have dangerous and [12:03] destructive those two pretty much go [12:05] together fear and aggression those can [12:08] go together as well and then behaviors [12:09] we just don't want our dogs to perform [12:12] so something like one dog hurting [12:15] another dog [12:16] that could be [12:18] potentially dangerous if the other dog [12:21] ended up becoming aggressive for that [12:24] behavior [12:25] but more likely than not if the two dogs [12:28] are together it's just probably [12:29] something that's annoying the dog that's [12:31] being hurted by the first dog in a [12:34] situation like that i'd like to start [12:37] with my marker that predicts negative [12:39] reinforcement going back to leash [12:41] pressure remember in order for a marker [12:44] to be a marker it must predict one of [12:47] the four quadrants of opera conditioning [12:50] so that's your positive and negative [12:51] reinforcement positive and negative [12:53] punishment so easy way to remember that [12:56] because again people confuse this all [12:58] the time because they think positive [13:00] means good and negative means bad but [13:03] really positive is adding to the [13:04] equation negative is removing something [13:07] from the equation reinforcement is [13:09] encouraging the repeat of a behavior [13:12] punishment is preventing the repeat of a [13:15] behavior so we can use negative [13:17] reinforcement to reinforce the behavior [13:20] we would prefer our dog to do in any [13:23] situation now remember with our markers [13:27] there's certain words that i like to use [13:29] and often i'll have people ask they'll [13:30] say do i have to say wrong all the time [13:33] or do i have to [13:34] say free you can say whatever words you [13:37] choose just be consistent with whatever [13:40] you determine your marker is going to be [13:42] so with the dogs that i train i like to [13:44] use yes and free as my markers that [13:46] predict positive reinforcement [13:48] i use no as my marker that predicts [13:50] positive punishment and i use wrong for [13:53] my marker that predicts negative [13:55] reinforcement that's going to be our [13:57] leash pressure so we have to make sure [13:59] that our dog is already trained on leash [14:02] pressure when we say wrong and we use [14:04] the leash pressure to show our dog what [14:06] we want them to do this becomes very [14:09] transferable i use it when i'm teaching [14:12] stays the dog breaks the state i say [14:14] wrong i calmly grab the leash i place [14:17] the dog back into the stay the dog goes [14:19] into a room that the dog is not allowed [14:22] to go into i say wrong i use a leash i [14:25] remove the dog from the room let's say [14:27] the dog jumps up on the furniture and [14:29] you don't want the dog on the furniture [14:30] you say wrong you use a leash to cue the [14:32] dog off of the furniture the dog jumps [14:34] up on somebody wrong you use a leash to [14:36] cue them off of that person so what's [14:39] nice about this it's not a punishment [14:41] we've taught the dog negative [14:43] reinforcements so they know how to [14:44] respond to it and since we've used it in [14:47] different situations it becomes very [14:50] very transferable and what it ends up [14:52] meaning to our dog is stop what you're [14:54] doing [14:55] go back to the pre or go back to the [14:57] previous position or pay attention to me [15:00] because i'm going to show you what i [15:02] want you to do [15:03] this is what i would probably use in [15:05] this situation i would make sure i have [15:08] either a tab on the dog that likes to do [15:10] the hurting behavior or i would have a [15:12] long line so i can communicate with the [15:14] dog from farther away i wait until the [15:17] dog does the hurting behavior the moment [15:19] the dog does that behavior i calmly say [15:22] wrong i walk over to the dog and i [15:24] redirect my dog to a behavior that i [15:27] would prefer my dog to do and i do this [15:29] every single time without fail the dog's [15:33] going to learn that doing that ends up [15:35] predicting you using your marker that [15:38] predicts negative reinforcement which [15:40] predicts the behavior you would prefer [15:42] your dog to do and what's going to end [15:44] up happening when you say wrong your dog [15:46] will end up doing the behavior you've [15:49] shown your dog to do when you use that [15:51] marker once i get to that point that [15:54] tells me that the dog knows what they're [15:56] supposed to do i've given them a very [15:58] clear path to success and i've taught [16:01] them how to turn off pressure by [16:02] complying and when we say wrong in a [16:04] sense we become the pressure because [16:06] we're telling the dog i'm going to show [16:07] you what i want you to do [16:09] and i'm going to continue it until you [16:12] do what i'm pretty much asking you to do [16:14] so for example if the dog breaks it down [16:16] i say wrong i grab the leash after i say [16:19] wrong i walk to the dog i grabbed the [16:21] leash i walked the dog back to where [16:22] they are and i where they were and then [16:24] i placed them into the down position [16:27] so we don't have to say anything else [16:30] after we say wrong wrong is telling the [16:31] dog i'm going to show you what i want [16:33] you to do once the dog starts to respond [16:35] to wrong and this goes with all my [16:36] obedience as well my stay command if the [16:39] dog breaks the stay and i say wrong and [16:41] the dog goes back to the stay [16:43] then if i want reliability at that point [16:46] i can now add corrections so instead of [16:50] the dog [16:52] when they break the position [16:54] saying wrong [16:55] now i'm going to say no [16:57] instead of using leash pressure i'm [17:00] going to give the dog a correction with [17:01] a leash pop [17:03] then i'm going to repeat the command [17:05] that i want the dog to perform so if i'm [17:08] let's say we're working on the stay then [17:10] i would tell the dog climb or whatever [17:12] the behavior it is that we're working on [17:14] and then i would assist the dog if [17:15] needed so when we start adding [17:17] corrections it's no [17:19] correction [17:20] recommand and then assist what we don't [17:23] want to do is we don't want to continue [17:26] to correct the dog for the same mistake [17:28] over and over again so what i mean by [17:31] that you wouldn't want to go [17:33] sit no correction sit no correction sit [17:38] no correction you would not want to do [17:40] that [17:41] because when we do start adding [17:42] corrections into our training routine [17:45] that creates additional stress [17:48] when we add stress into our training our [17:51] dogs are not going to be able to think [17:53] as clearly as they are able to think [17:55] when there's no stress associated so we [17:58] have to keep that in mind we don't want [18:00] to continue to correct because again [18:03] that additional stress is going to make [18:05] it harder for our dogs [18:07] so i said sip the dog didn't sit no [18:09] correction i wreaked command sit and [18:12] then if the dog needs it i'm going to [18:14] help them whether by using a lure or by [18:17] using the leash pressure but i'm going [18:19] to make sure that the dog is successful [18:21] then i'm gonna let them know nice job [18:23] good boy or good girl whatever the case [18:25] may be [18:26] okay [18:35] okay so now we're looking at a dog that [18:37] doesn't like to be moved from a comfy [18:39] spot and doesn't like his nails touched [18:43] okay so if i have a dog that [18:46] doesn't want to be moved from a position [18:49] any time our dogs do a certain behavior [18:52] we [18:53] set our dogs up for success so we can [18:55] reward them the exact moment they do the [18:57] behavior correctly [18:58] but we also want to set our dogs up for [19:01] failure so we can reinforce rules at the [19:05] correct time as well [19:07] so in a situation like this if i know i [19:10] have a dog that doesn't want to be moved [19:12] let's say the dog is on the couch and [19:14] this will actually go to another point [19:16] if i allow my dog on the furniture and [19:19] my dog starts to resource guard the [19:21] furniture well now that's a problem and [19:23] i'm probably not going to allow the dog [19:26] to stay on the furniture anymore because [19:28] now the dog's starting to resource guard [19:30] it it's an issue and it needs to be [19:32] addressed and it needs to be fixed [19:35] however if the dog [19:37] it's also going to depend if the dog is [19:40] younger or if the dog is bluffing [19:43] so i talk about this in my training [19:45] manual some dogs will bluff meaning [19:48] they're going to act out of behavior [19:50] that appears to be aggressive [19:53] but they're not willing to follow [19:55] through now of course if you're going to [19:57] work with a dog and you're not sure if [19:59] the dog's going to follow through or not [20:01] you're taking a chance [20:02] and what i mean by that is [20:04] let's look at a young puppy let's say a [20:07] puppy is starting to resource guard a [20:09] toy [20:10] if i go to grab that toy and that puppy [20:12] snarls [20:14] grabs a hold of the toy pulls it in and [20:16] looks at me as if the dogs are as if the [20:18] puppy's going to bite me i'm just going [20:20] to grab the toy i'm going to allow the [20:22] puppy to bite me i'm just going to sit [20:24] there and show the puppy that it doesn't [20:26] have any sort of effect or impact on me [20:28] once the puppy stops biting i release [20:31] the toy and i say good puppy nice job [20:34] then i go back and i grab it again puppy [20:36] tries to bite me again i wait the puppy [20:39] stops biting once they stop good puppy i [20:42] release the toy and i keep doing this [20:45] and what's going to end up happening is [20:46] the puppy is going to look at my hand [20:48] when i grab the toy look up at me i [20:50] release the puppy can go back to the toy [20:53] so i'm showing them just because my hand [20:55] is grabbing the toy doesn't mean that [20:58] i'm going to take it away from you [21:01] we also have older dogs that will bluff [21:03] so [21:04] you might try to i had a dog let's let [21:06] me tell you another example i had this [21:08] uh sheepdog that i was training and this [21:11] dog was allowed to get away with [21:13] anything [21:15] that he wanted up until the point of [21:17] being trained [21:18] and he would pull on the leash and so i [21:20] was working on loose leash walking i [21:23] started off with leash pressure [21:24] everything was fine once i started [21:26] adding corrections [21:28] he would act like he was going to bite [21:30] me he would go in front of me i would [21:31] say no i would do a leash pop after the [21:34] leash pop he would growl and then he [21:36] would jump back like he was going to [21:38] attack me and i would just [21:40] say [21:42] the command that i wanted him to do [21:44] after the correction he'll and i would [21:46] just make him go into the heel position [21:48] because i could tell he was bluffing [21:50] but anyways [21:52] let's just be safe with this situation [21:55] keep a leash on your dog [21:57] and then ask your dog to leave the [21:59] commanded position [22:01] and then use the leash to reinforce [22:03] those rules and continue to do that as [22:06] many times as it takes for when you ask [22:08] your dog finn to leave the comfortable [22:11] position your dog will do it [22:13] automatically because you've reinforced [22:15] those rules and those expectations so if [22:17] you need to keep a leash on him while [22:19] he's relaxing in the house until you no [22:22] longer have to use the leash to [22:24] reinforce the rules a leash is going to [22:27] be a means to an end if we have to have [22:29] a leash on our dog inside the house it's [22:31] because we're still working on potty [22:33] training and we're still working on [22:35] house manners this would fall under the [22:37] category of house manners the dog isn't [22:39] fully trained on house manners yet so i [22:41] would probably keep either a tab on the [22:43] dog or a leash when the dog's in that [22:45] position i'm going to give the dog the [22:47] command off and then i'm going to use [22:49] the leash to reinforce it if the dog [22:51] does become aggressive and tries to bite [22:54] at me i can use the leash to prevent [22:56] that forward movement once the dog [22:58] relaxes i can turn off the pressure nice [23:00] job good boy remember anytime we are [23:03] correcting our dogs we want to make sure [23:05] that it's never personal it's always [23:08] cause and effect the dog does the [23:10] behavior i respond a certain way i'm [23:13] never mad i'm never upset i want the dog [23:16] to understand that their behavior is [23:18] what is causing my actions so if i do [23:21] have to correct a dog i'm often thinking [23:23] to myself like hey i got you're telling [23:25] me to correct you i don't want to [23:26] correct you but you told me to correct [23:28] you so i'm going to comply so i'm not [23:30] mad or upset we don't want to ever try [23:34] to like contrary to popular belief it's [23:36] not about being the alpha it's not about [23:38] dominating our dogs it's about being on [23:41] the same team working towards a common [23:43] goal and if you have to adjust something [23:45] again it's always cause and effect so [23:47] the dog's up there off cue the dog off [23:49] yay nice job and then again continue to [23:52] do that until the dog responds on the [23:54] command alone without the help of the [23:56] physical cue all right [23:58] my five month old puppy jumps and bites [24:00] guests butt as he tries to hurt them [24:03] it's embarrassing he mouths them as well [24:06] should i correct him or teach my guests [24:08] how to respond to the puppy [24:11] if i have a puppy that's doing something [24:13] like that i'm gonna correct that just [24:16] right away i'm gonna do a little leash [24:17] pop [24:18] i'll let my friends know that are coming [24:20] over i'll say i'm working with my puppy [24:22] it's a herding dog so she likes to jump [24:25] up and nip when she does that i'm going [24:27] to make a correction no big deal so the [24:30] moment the puppy does the behavior no [24:32] leash pop the moment the puppy stops yay [24:35] good boy or whatever it's the same thing [24:38] with a dog biting a leash this is very [24:41] very common so [24:43] for example yesterday i worked with [24:45] about five different dogs maybe it was [24:47] six different dogs we were filming a few [24:49] more episodes and two of the dogs tried [24:52] biting the leash and the owner said this [24:54] is an issue my dog always bites the [24:56] leash when we try doing leash pressure [24:58] work or we're starting to do loose leash [25:00] walking the dog would bite the leash [25:01] very common all i do when a dog bites a [25:04] leash is i pop it out of their mouth [25:06] they may try to bite it one more time i [25:08] pop it out of their mouth again and the [25:10] dog goes well that's no fun i'm not [25:12] going to continue biting the leash so [25:14] it's the same with this this is [25:15] something i'm going to correct and i [25:17] know i don't have videos demonstrating a [25:20] correction but all it is it's a it's [25:22] just a little pop [25:24] and [25:25] i do have a video where i demonstrate a [25:27] leash pop but not on a dog um let me see [25:30] i don't have a leash in here [25:33] but what i can do [25:35] i'll just use this [25:37] so i would tell the dog no and then pop [25:40] the leash like that that would be a [25:42] leash pop notice that the start point [25:45] and the end point is the same for the [25:48] hand that's popping the leash [25:50] okay [25:51] let's see what's next [25:53] also my also in the car my puppy drools [25:56] like crazy that's another common issue [25:59] that a lot of people run into he gets [26:01] anxious and just freezes also in my car [26:04] um if my friend's truck in my friend's [26:07] truck he's perfectly fine what could [26:09] cause this and how do i fix it he will [26:11] not take any treats while in my car [26:14] okay so if i have a dog that doesn't [26:16] like being in a car [26:18] then what i'm going to do is i'm going [26:20] to first teach the dog how to jump in [26:23] and out of the car without taking the [26:25] dog anywhere we want to start creating a [26:28] strong positive association to the [26:31] vehicle so i had one dog that i was [26:33] working with before that was terrified [26:35] of being in the car and before i even [26:38] moved the car with the dog inside of the [26:40] vehicle i got the dog comfortable eating [26:42] in the vehicle and just like you said [26:45] the dog didn't want to take the food at [26:47] first when a dog is in a position where [26:48] they are stressed out anxious they won't [26:51] want to take food from us [26:53] this reminds me of another story where [26:54] else i was teaching a labrador retriever [26:57] to be comfortable in public this dog was [26:59] terrified of being on public and when i [27:01] first had the dog out in public the dog [27:03] would not take any food [27:05] but this is what i do in these [27:06] situations i don't feed the dog in any [27:09] other location until they start taking [27:11] food from the location that i'm trying [27:14] to get the dog comfortable with or using [27:16] toys is another good option someone said [27:18] train using toys um yes toys is great if [27:22] your dog enjoys toys but what i would do [27:24] is i would take the dog out i would have [27:25] them go into the vehicle i would offer [27:27] them food if they don't want any food [27:29] i'd have them come back out and i would [27:30] try again at dinner and i'm not going to [27:32] give them any food in between that [27:34] training exercise i bring the dog back [27:37] out i have the dog jump in the vehicle i [27:38] offer the dog food if the dog doesn't [27:41] want food there maybe i'm going to try [27:42] to do some obedience right next to the [27:44] vehicle with the door open and i'm going [27:46] to feed the dog there so this would go [27:48] right in line with counter conditioning [27:50] and desensitization [27:52] we introduce it at the lowest stimuli [27:54] possible even if that means we're just [27:56] next to the vehicle and we're not in the [27:58] vehicle but whatever we need to do to [28:01] make the dog comfortable [28:02] if you have another dog that is [28:04] comfortable inside of the vehicle that [28:07] can also help a dog overcome those fears [28:10] and i wouldn't worry about the dogs [28:12] finding the truck but the dog's not okay [28:15] in the car we know the dog's not okay in [28:16] the car so that's what we're going to [28:18] focus on i had another dog that had the [28:20] same issue but the dogs that that dog [28:23] lived with was comfortable in the car so [28:26] we got all three of the dogs in the [28:27] vehicle we would drive it around for 30 [28:30] seconds and then we would allow the dogs [28:32] to come out and we would do this over [28:34] and over again and gradually increase [28:36] the amount of time that we had the dogs [28:37] in the vehicle another thing that's [28:40] important to keep in mind there are [28:41] people out there that will only take [28:43] their dog in the vehicle when they're [28:45] going somewhere like the veterinarian [28:47] clinic if that's the case the dog is not [28:49] going to like being in the vehicle [28:51] because it always predicts something [28:53] unpleasant [28:54] another great way to get the dog to like [28:56] the vehicle is [28:58] every time you go in the car take them [29:02] very short distance but somewhere where [29:04] the dog [29:05] enjoys so um here's a great example with [29:08] that ari for a while did not like going [29:11] to the car [29:12] and the reason why a few years back [29:15] she ended up getting a thorn in her [29:17] eyeball [29:18] and i had to take her down to a [29:20] specialist they were able to remove the [29:22] thorn stitch it up it was great only [29:25] cost me five thousand dollars no big [29:26] deal [29:27] but she had to go back multiple times we [29:30] had to put drops in her eyes the works [29:32] and she didn't like going to the vehicle [29:35] after that she was terrified of [29:37] well i like to take my dogs to the park [29:40] every day not the dog dog park i just [29:41] take them to a normal park and i'll play [29:43] chuck it with them i'll do a little bit [29:44] of tug i'll play frisbee anything that [29:47] my dogs enjoy that's going to get them a [29:49] little bit tired and i can incorporate [29:51] some [29:52] obedience so i just did that every [29:54] single day and after about [29:56] a week she was back to normal super [29:59] excited to go to the vehicle because she [30:01] goes oh yeah the vehicle means we're [30:02] going to the park [30:04] not going because i got a thorn in my [30:06] eyeball so that's something to keep in [30:07] mind as well make sure it predicts [30:09] something nice keep the drives very very [30:12] short once you start getting the dog [30:14] into the vehicle even something as [30:16] simple as [30:17] starting the car and then turning off [30:19] the engine [30:21] okay [30:23] uh five-month-old german shepherd dog [30:26] partner unable to follow through correct [30:28] with rules etc no jumping biting or [30:31] taking things from his hands partner [30:33] just keeps allowing it should i correct [30:35] dog myself [30:37] any other options okay that can be [30:40] difficult if there are other people in [30:42] the house and they're not following the [30:43] rules if that's the case i'm just going [30:46] to work with the dog and train the dog [30:47] as if the dog's only my dog i'm going to [30:49] do the obedience i'm going to exercise [30:52] the dog play with the dog all that good [30:54] stuff [30:54] dogs are very very situational they can [30:59] just like kids [31:00] can tell whether the which parent is [31:03] going to give in which parent is going [31:05] to allow them to have what it is that [31:07] they want [31:08] dogs are the same way [31:10] they can identify which one [31:13] gives them whatever they want which one [31:15] reinforces rules and expectations so [31:18] dogs also like structure [31:21] i would just continue to work with the [31:22] dog train them if you can't convince [31:24] your partner to help with it oh well i'm [31:27] not going to stress that too much and [31:28] i'm going to work with my dog when i [31:30] went through school [31:32] i was told if i train my dog [31:35] and i leave my dog with somebody let's [31:37] say a friend or family and they don't [31:40] reinforce any of the training i'm gonna [31:42] come back and it's going to be as if i [31:44] never train my dog and i was so worried [31:46] and i'm so stressed out [31:48] about that that i didn't want people [31:51] giving my dog commands i didn't want [31:53] people handling my dog with a leash [31:55] nothing because i had this fear that [31:57] when i get the dog back if they made [31:59] mistakes it's going to show with my dog [32:02] now in a long enough timeline let's say [32:04] you leave for a few months and you come [32:06] back you're going to have to put your [32:08] dog through a little bit of refresher [32:10] training but they do remember a good [32:12] example is i did scent detection with a [32:15] golden retriever that i trained to be a [32:17] service dog [32:18] and the dog was very very [32:20] exceptional at scent detection training [32:23] and search and rescue training such a [32:24] pleasure to work with [32:27] i did not train scent detection for [32:29] about two years and then [32:32] at about two years [32:33] i started doing scent detection training [32:35] again with this dog and the dog [32:37] instantly picked it right back up [32:39] so [32:42] i hope that answers your question [32:46] yeah okay [32:47] all right let's see what the next one is [32:50] i would like to know your thoughts on [32:52] adaptable collar for eight week old [32:54] swiss shepherd puppy i read that it [32:57] reduces the anxiety [32:59] and helps the puppy to calm down and [33:01] helps her to adjust with the new home [33:04] if it's helping your dog i would give it [33:06] a shot if it works if it's helping your [33:08] dog then i would continue to do it if [33:10] you're not seeing anything any success [33:12] it's not working with your dog and this [33:14] is why it's so important to understand [33:16] the science of dog training and why i [33:17] always talk about the science of dog [33:19] training the science is always going to [33:20] be the same we're going to use certain [33:22] things to motivate our dogs to do the [33:24] behaviors that we want them to perform [33:26] but we have to adjust according to each [33:28] dog one technique that may work on dog a [33:32] will not work on dog b a good example is [33:35] dogs jumping up you may have seen this [33:37] on videos or you may have read this [33:39] somewhere if a dog jumps up cross your [33:42] arms [33:43] turn and ignore the dog once the dog [33:45] stops jumping pet and praise the dog [33:48] this technique is great [33:50] if the dog's goal when the dog is [33:52] jumping up is to get the human's [33:54] attention so dog goes i want your [33:57] attention jumps up and the human's [33:59] attention goes away [34:00] the dog sits and now the dog gets that [34:03] attention again the dog goes oh great if [34:05] i want your attention i sit nicely but [34:08] what if the dog enjoys the act of [34:11] jumping [34:12] ignoring the behavior is no longer going [34:14] to work that's a self-reinforcing [34:16] behavior [34:17] another good example is let's say [34:20] you have an area in your backyard that [34:22] you don't want your dog to go to [34:24] and so you think to yourself you know [34:26] what every time my dog steps in that [34:28] area i'm going to spray my dog with the [34:30] water hose and let's say you have two [34:31] dogs [34:32] one dog goes in and you spray and the [34:34] dog's like ah i don't like that and the [34:36] dog stops going into that area [34:38] the other dog goes to that area and you [34:40] spray that dog and the dog goes oh that [34:42] water hose is awesome and the dog sees [34:44] it as a reward [34:46] so with one of the dogs they see it as a [34:49] punishment the other dog sees it as a [34:51] reward so again we adjust according to [34:53] the dog if it's working with your dog [34:55] then i would continue to do it if it [34:56] seems like it's helping [34:58] uh feeding a puppy in the crate when i'm [35:00] working with a puppy i like to do [35:03] continual reinforcement while i'm [35:06] training them and i will train them [35:08] during meal time so i use meal time as [35:11] an opportunity to train my dog i bring [35:13] them out in the morning i have my dog's [35:15] food i work with my dog once the food is [35:18] gone the session's over and then i can [35:20] repeat that process in the evening for [35:22] the puppy's meal time but if i'm not [35:26] training the puppy there's nothing wrong [35:28] with feeding them in the creed a lot of [35:30] people do it it's actually really nice [35:32] if you're not doing any training and [35:34] you're feeding the puppy in the crate [35:35] it's good because [35:38] if you have multiple dogs it's even more [35:40] helpful but if i am feeding a dog i do [35:43] like to feed them in the crate for a [35:44] couple reasons one [35:46] it shows them that they're in a secure [35:49] place and they're not going to be as [35:50] worried about somebody possibly taking [35:53] the food away and if you have multiple [35:55] dogs feeding them at the same time often [35:57] what will happen is the dogs will eat [35:59] very quickly one of the dogs might be [36:02] eating very quickly because it wants to [36:04] eat the other dog's food and the other [36:06] dog could be eating very quickly because [36:08] it wants to prevent the other dog from [36:10] eating their food so when they're in the [36:12] crate it just makes it a more secure [36:14] comfortable location for them so that's [36:17] great but if you are doing training then [36:19] i would use meal time as an opportunity [36:21] to train my dog something that is often [36:25] asked on my videos is do i always have [36:28] to give my dog a bunch of treats now of [36:31] course we want our dogs to do behaviors [36:34] for us because they've been taught to do [36:36] them not because we have to hold the [36:38] treat in front of our dog's face [36:41] when we start off we always want to use [36:43] continual reinforcement and you might [36:45] say to yourself well what if i have a [36:47] dog that is not food motivated every dog [36:50] is food motivated i do talk about it in [36:52] my manual some people don't like the way [36:55] that it sounds but i like to use the [36:57] correct terminology for example a [36:59] conditioned punisher somebody once told [37:01] me you shouldn't say condition punisher [37:03] it doesn't sound good it's like well [37:04] that's the terminology just like [37:06] positive punishment negative punishment [37:08] this is the actual terminology that [37:11] we're going to be using so when we are [37:13] working with a dog that's not food [37:15] motivated maybe the dog has been free [37:17] fed its entire life never had to work [37:19] for any food then what i do is simple [37:22] food deprivation it doesn't mean we're [37:24] going to starve the dog [37:26] but what it does mean is we're going to [37:28] make the dog work for every bite of food [37:30] i bring the dog out i show the dog a [37:31] piece of food i go hey you ready to [37:33] train i offered to the dog the dog goes [37:36] no i'm not interested i say no problem [37:38] we'll try again at dinner i bring the [37:39] dog back out for dinner i go you ready [37:41] to train the dog says no i'm not [37:43] interested in the food and i say no [37:45] problem we'll try again at breakfast [37:47] breakfast rolls around i offer the dog [37:49] the food the dog goes yes i will take [37:51] that and then i can start training and [37:54] using food as a motivating factor [37:56] remember when our dogs do a behavior [37:58] they're doing it because of one of three [38:01] reasons either a [38:02] the dog is doing it for the possibility [38:05] of accessing something pleasant food toy [38:07] affection the dog is doing the behavior [38:10] because the behavior itself is fun self [38:13] reinforcing self rewarding behaviors [38:15] chasing a squirrel that's a fun behavior [38:18] the act of chasing is fun so the dog [38:20] continues to do the behavior or c the [38:23] dog is doing the behavior to prevent the [38:26] possibility of a consequence or [38:29] correction so when we start off we use [38:31] continual reinforcement i have a [38:33] three-stage process [38:35] that i like to follow with the dogs that [38:36] i train in the very beginning we reward [38:39] every single correct repetition sit yes [38:41] reward down yes reward or free whatever [38:43] marker it is that you're using once the [38:46] dog starts to do the behavior on the [38:48] command alone then i go to stage two [38:52] stage two when the dog does the correct [38:54] behavior i'm going to do one of two [38:56] things either i will mark and reward as [38:59] i was doing before or i will provide the [39:02] dog with verbal praise now i continue [39:04] this step for a few weeks perhaps then i [39:07] go to stage three stage three when the [39:09] dog does the behavior i mark in reward [39:12] or i provide verbal praise or i say [39:15] nothing at all and i slowly fade out [39:18] rewarding and giving the dog praise now [39:20] i'm still going to throw in random [39:22] rewards i'm still going to randomly [39:24] praise but it's not going to be every [39:27] single time the dog does something right [39:29] another good thing to do if you're using [39:32] your dog's kibble in the beginning to [39:34] train so i like to have my dogs on a raw [39:36] diet but when i start training them in [39:38] the very beginning i use kibble because [39:40] kibble's going to be easier to handle i [39:42] like stella and chewie's freeze-dried [39:44] coated kibble it comes with little [39:46] freeze-dried nuggets it's a higher [39:48] quality kibble than a lot of other [39:50] options out there and then i will also [39:52] add freeze dry treats in the mix while [39:56] i'm training so when they get that [39:59] freeze-dried piece of food it's like a [40:01] bonus and it actually makes our dogs [40:03] more motivated to train and if you are [40:06] looking for good freeze-dried dog food i [40:08] would highly recommend ari and charlie's [40:10] freeze-dried dog food which is available [40:12] aryancharlies.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 426/841,com i hope you guys like [40:15] that plug but that's my freeze-dried dog [40:17] food that we recently released we only [40:19] have one protein source salmon there is [40:22] a little bit of turkey in there as well [40:24] but it's mostly salmon so if you guys [40:26] are using freeze-dried dog food [40:28] definitely check that out [40:30] but going back to where we were on the [40:33] question [40:35] feeding in the crate oh yeah i started [40:37] talking about [40:38] using food for training i started to go [40:40] in a different direction there let's get [40:42] the next question [40:43] during a focused structured heal my dog [40:46] always walks just a little too far ahead [40:49] of me [40:50] where a left turn is difficult when he [40:52] starts inching forward should i slow [40:54] down to create distance and correct with [40:56] the prong or any other suggestions [40:59] that's going to depend where our dog is [41:02] in the training remember a heel even a [41:05] focused heel that's a stay command so we [41:08] have sit stay down stay [41:10] climb stay stand stay [41:13] heel stay center stay [41:15] come stay which would be the sit front [41:17] position [41:18] the difference is a down stay is a [41:21] stationary stay [41:23] whereas a heel stay even focused heel [41:26] can become a mobile stay [41:28] so if i'm still in the early stages of [41:31] teaching a dog focused heel i'm not [41:34] going to be [41:35] correcting because it's still early but [41:38] if the dog is well trained they've gone [41:41] through the entire process i'm at the [41:43] point of adding corrections then i can [41:44] add corrections but [41:46] just like you said should i wait to [41:48] allow the dog to go forward [41:51] what i like to do when i'm working on a [41:53] heel this is going to apply more for our [41:57] loose leash walking and less for our [42:00] focused heel because a focused heel the [42:02] dog should be looking at us the entire [42:04] time and something that michael ellis [42:07] talks about which is an excellent way of [42:10] explaining this [42:11] something like a down stay is very black [42:14] and white the dog's elbows touch the [42:16] ground boom the dog's in a down stay [42:18] very clear the dog knows what they're [42:20] supposed to do but something like [42:23] loose leash walking or focused heel [42:26] that's very gray for the dog meaning the [42:29] dog may think they're doing it exactly [42:31] the way that you want them to but they [42:33] don't realize that they're forging a [42:35] little bit or they're lagging a little [42:37] bit or maybe they're a little bit wide [42:39] if i'm doing a focused heel i'm going to [42:41] spend a lot of time luring and working [42:44] on that precision obedience i enjoy [42:47] teaching focus heal it's very fun it's a [42:49] good exercise i'm also going to use the [42:51] leash to help guide my dog into those [42:53] more precision type obedience in [42:56] addition we can use a healing stick i [42:58] have a video on that a healing stick [43:00] we're using negative reinforcement that [43:02] means we can guide the dog by simply [43:05] applying a little bit of pressure the [43:07] same way we do with the leash pressure [43:08] work to manipulate the dog's position [43:12] but if i'm doing loose leash walking [43:14] and i'm just starting out i want to make [43:17] sure the dog knows how to find the heel [43:19] position and i also want to make sure [43:21] that the dog understands leash pressure [43:24] and i've already taught stay for my [43:26] stationary commands climb stay down stay [43:29] sit stay those are [43:31] really great to start with to help get [43:33] the dog to understand the stay command [43:36] when we start reinforcing it with our [43:38] wrong marker that predicts leash [43:40] pressure so then when i say heal and i [43:43] start to walk if the dog goes ahead of [43:46] me i say wrong i use the leash i guide [43:49] the dog back into position once a dog's [43:51] in the position i turn off the pressure [43:53] and i go right back into the walk the [43:55] dog starts to go ahead of me again wrong [43:57] i use leash and i guide the dog back [44:00] into the position when i am doing this [44:02] exercise [44:04] my goal is to leave the dog's heel [44:07] position as many times as possible i'm [44:10] waiting for the dog to leave the heel [44:11] position this is [44:13] important because what it does is first [44:16] of all you can make it a game so the [44:17] training should be fun you shouldn't be [44:19] getting frustrated when your dog leaves [44:21] the heel position i make it a game as [44:23] i'm walking i'm waiting for that [44:24] opportunity i sneak out of the heel [44:26] position wrong i bring the dog back i'm [44:28] like yeah i got you it becomes a game so [44:30] now when we're walking the dog is paying [44:33] attention to me because the dog is [44:36] expecting me to try to leave the heel [44:38] position [44:40] once i get to the point where the dog [44:41] goes ahead of me i say heal and the dog [44:43] jumps back into heel position then i can [44:46] start adding corrections so just like [44:48] anything else i start to walk if i see [44:51] an opportunity to sneak out of the dog's [44:53] heel position or the dog just starts [44:55] walking ahead of me i make sure the dog [44:58] is clearly out of heel position this is [45:00] very important you do not want to [45:03] correct the dog when they are in heel [45:05] position because the heel position [45:08] should be [45:09] the best position for the dog to be in [45:11] the dog should go anytime i want to be [45:13] in the safest best position where i get [45:15] treats pet love and i'm never corrected [45:18] that's the heel position [45:20] so i make sure it's very clear the dog [45:22] is out of the heel position they're far [45:24] ahead of me no [45:26] then we pop the leash giving the dog a [45:28] correction the dog's gonna turn around [45:30] we're gonna say heal and then we're [45:32] gonna guide the dog back into the heel [45:34] position the same way we did before with [45:36] the leash pressure once the dog's back [45:38] in the heel position we turn off the [45:39] pressure nice way to go good job buddy [45:44] if we do it correctly the dog should [45:46] quickly learn how to maintain the heel [45:49] position often what i highly recommend [45:52] doing [45:53] and this is something i'm trying to [45:55] incorporate this more in my video so as [45:57] i mentioned earlier yesterday we spent [46:00] all day filming and i was working with [46:02] different people and their dogs all [46:04] great dogs very sweet fun to work with [46:07] and what you're going to see is the [46:09] small differences in hand movements and [46:13] body language and handling of the leash [46:16] that you see with someone who's first [46:18] learning in comparison to someone who's [46:20] been doing it for 10 years [46:23] you need to film yourself when you first [46:25] start learning how to train because when [46:27] you film yourself you're going to be [46:29] able to identify mistakes that you're [46:32] making i noticed with my own training i [46:35] started to get better [46:37] much faster once i started to film [46:39] myself and studying the footage same if [46:42] you're an athlete if you played sports [46:45] if you've done any sort of anything that [46:47] requires physical movement dancing [46:49] sports [46:50] martial arts [46:52] you film yourself and then you review [46:54] the footage to identify the mistakes [46:56] that you make and as a lot of you [46:58] already know the most common mistake [46:59] that people make is pairing their [47:01] physical with their verbal but body [47:03] language also plays a big role how we [47:06] handle the leash and in these videos [47:09] where i'm working with people who are [47:10] new to dog training you can see some of [47:13] these mistakes a little bit more clearly [47:15] and that's going to help you identify if [47:17] you're making the same mistakes but [47:19] filming yourself is something i cannot [47:22] stress enough it is incredibly [47:24] incredibly important again once i [47:26] started filming myself i became a much [47:28] better dog trainer and i was slow at [47:31] learning how to train dogs it took me a [47:33] long time i made a lot of mistakes i [47:36] mean i think the first dog i was [47:38] training it took two months before i got [47:40] the dog to do it down on the verbal [47:42] command alone i was like what is going [47:44] on and my timing was wrong my reward [47:47] delivery was off my praise would be at [47:50] the wrong spot and because of that the [47:52] process of teaching my dog was much [47:55] slower than it is now when we fix the [47:58] timing so film yourself and that's gonna [48:00] again help you identify some of the [48:02] small subtle mistakes that you may be [48:04] making that you don't notice okay so [48:07] that's all the questions for channel [48:09] members so now i'm going to go to the [48:11] live video and i'm going to start going [48:13] through some of the questions maybe [48:15] another [48:16] 10 minutes or so so let's go to the very [48:19] top [48:21] uh australian kettle dog [48:25] okay so the first one is about [48:29] a dog that was taught to [48:32] attack cats and you have two cats [48:37] this is a tough situation and the reason [48:39] why is you don't want to risk [48:42] the well-being of your cats [48:45] if i have a dog that is cat aggressive [48:48] i'm gonna do my best to keep them [48:50] separated [48:51] to me it's not worth the risk of [48:54] possibly having one of your cats [48:56] attacked or worse case scenario one of [48:58] your cats killed by the dog so i would [49:01] keep them separated that's going to be [49:03] the safest option [49:05] if you don't want to keep them separated [49:08] then i would definitely muzzle train the [49:10] dog and then i would do a ton of [49:12] obedience with reliability meaning i'm [49:15] implementing corrections and i'm making [49:17] sure the dog is doing what it is that i [49:19] want them to do but i'm not going to i [49:21] don't want to let that cat and that dog [49:24] interact because it's going to be high [49:25] risk [49:26] even if you have a muzzle on the dog [49:29] could still end up muzzle punch punching [49:31] the cat so that's going to be something [49:34] that [49:38] yeah i mean you even said that the [49:40] previous owners [49:41] made the dog go after cats and even [49:44] killing them sometimes [49:46] so yeah [49:47] my my recommendation is to keep them [49:49] separated if you don't want to [49:52] muzzle train the dog have the muzzle on [49:54] all the time until you are 100 certain [49:57] that the dog's not going to attack the [49:59] cats and you can try to use uh counter [50:03] conditioning [50:04] desensitizing the dog slowly [50:07] exposing the dog to the cat with the [50:09] muzzle on creating strong positive [50:11] associations and if the dog does try to [50:14] attack the cat i would correct that [50:16] behavior [50:18] but again i would just keep them [50:19] separated [50:21] all right if you crate train at home [50:24] first it would make it easier yeah crate [50:26] training is good [50:30] okay [50:32] good morning from japan awesome [50:35] all right let me see i love the book and [50:37] the videos thank you i really appreciate [50:39] it i am working on my second book the [50:42] second book is going to be way more [50:44] detailed than the first one the first [50:46] one was just a manual it was you know [50:48] and i call it a manual because i don't [50:50] really consider it to be [50:52] the length of a standard book [50:55] you can get through my manual if you're [50:56] a fast reader in under an hour [50:59] if you're a slower reader even two hours [51:01] you can get through it but the idea was [51:04] i wanted to put the information in the [51:06] most condensed way possible [51:09] to easily consume and use it as a [51:11] reference so i didn't include any sort [51:13] of anecdotes to explain how i use the [51:16] training in different areas i wanted to [51:18] be this is the science this is how you [51:21] apply it this is how you get results and [51:23] this is what you do if [51:25] you're running into sort of issues just [51:27] like on my episode behavioral and [51:30] modificat uh behavioral and modification [51:32] flow chart [51:34] all right let's see [51:37] get yourself a balanced trainer [51:42] okay sorry i'm trying to read to see [51:44] where the next question is [51:51] okay so we have one that it seems like [51:53] she barks a lot barks at other dogs even [51:56] barks at the tv [51:57] if you want if you have a dog that barks [52:00] a lot you can teach a quiet command [52:03] now this is something that i'm okay [52:05] talking about it on a live q a [52:07] especially 52 minutes into it if you're [52:10] still watching it means you're really [52:12] interested in dog training [52:15] if you look up videos on how to teach a [52:17] dog to be quiet what you're usually [52:20] going to find is teach the dog how to [52:23] bark [52:24] and then teach the dog to be quiet [52:27] so a good example would be you knock on [52:29] the wall the dog barks you reward that [52:33] behavior then when the dog's quiet you [52:35] say quiet good dog and you reward that [52:39] sounds great problem is doesn't work [52:42] the best way to teach the quiet command [52:45] excuse me from my experience [52:48] remember if we want to teach our dogs a [52:50] commanded behavior what do we have to be [52:53] able to do [52:54] well of course we want to teach our dogs [52:56] the markers that's going to help us [52:58] communicate with them in a timely manner [53:00] when they're right and wrong [53:01] and then when we're teaching a behavior [53:03] we want to make sure we can get the dog [53:05] to do the behavior with the physical cue [53:09] when we know we can get our dog to do [53:10] the behavior with the physical cue [53:12] then we can put it on a command [53:15] but if i have a dog that's barking [53:17] and i have no way of stopping that dog [53:20] from barking by using a physical cue [53:23] then i'm not going to be able to teach [53:24] the dog a quiet command [53:27] so first [53:28] i try using leash pressure [53:31] so i have the dog in front of me i know [53:33] the dog's going to bark we talked about [53:34] this before we set the dogs up to fail [53:38] so we can correct them at the exact [53:39] moment they make the mistake just like [53:41] we set them up to succeed so we can [53:43] reward them at the exact moment they do [53:45] the right behavior so i have the dog on [53:47] the leash i'm sitting there the dog [53:50] barks [53:51] i say quiet [53:53] then i apply leash pressure by lifting [53:56] up on the leash the moment the dog stops [53:59] barking i turn off the pressure [54:02] good dog [54:03] now this will work with some dogs [54:06] the leash pressure is enough to get the [54:08] dog to go okay [54:09] i'm not going to continue to bark [54:11] every time the dog barks you go quiet [54:13] you apply the pressure the dog stops [54:15] barking turn off the pressure good dog [54:18] that will work on some for the dogs that [54:21] that does not work on [54:23] then what i do instead of treating the [54:24] command quiet as a marker for negative [54:27] reinforcement because as you can see [54:30] that's almost the same thing if you [54:31] think about it how's that any different [54:32] from going wrong and applying leash [54:34] pressure right it's the same thing wrong [54:37] leash pressure [54:38] quiet leash pressure well the difference [54:41] is wrong always guarantees negative [54:43] reinforcement it's a marker [54:45] whereas quiet is a command [54:48] just like every other command that we're [54:50] teaching our dog we stop using the [54:53] physical cue once the dog starts to [54:55] respond on the verbal command alone [54:58] after enough of those your dog barks you [54:59] say quiet the dog goes the next thing [55:01] you're going to do is you're going to [55:03] apply leash pressure which is going to [55:05] cause me to stop barking so i'm going to [55:07] stop barking before you apply the leash [55:10] pressure boom now we've taught it on the [55:13] command so now after you say quiet you [55:16] no longer have to apply leash pressure [55:18] because the dog is responding to the [55:20] quiet command [55:22] it's the same if we're using a [55:24] correction so the dogs that the leash [55:26] pressure doesn't work now i like to [55:27] start with leash pressure first remember [55:30] anytime we're trying to develop [55:32] reliability within our obedience [55:34] and how we're communicating with our [55:35] dogs we always want to use the least [55:38] amount of force necessary in order to [55:41] accomplish the goal so leash pressure [55:43] first if that doesn't work then i'm [55:45] going to treat the word quiet as a [55:48] condition punisher so no is my marker [55:52] for a correction that means it's a [55:54] conditioned punisher it's been [55:55] conditioned [55:57] to be positive punishment condition [55:59] punisher [56:00] so then it would be the same as the dog [56:03] barks no correction but instead of [56:05] saying no you're going to say quiet [56:08] correction the dog barks quiet [56:10] correction making sure we say quiet [56:13] before the correction [56:15] after enough of those your dog barks you [56:17] say quiet [56:19] before you make the correction the dog [56:21] stops barking now we know we have it on [56:24] the verbal command so the next time you [56:26] tell your dog quiet you don't have to [56:28] correct because now the dog knows that [56:30] when you stay quiet they need to be [56:32] quiet so that would be the difference of [56:35] using quiet instead of using [56:38] no because no again is a marker that [56:42] guarantees the dog's going to receive a [56:43] correction so that is what works for me [56:46] when it teaches when we're trying to [56:47] teach a dog not to bark but same thing [56:50] you have to keep in mind [56:52] if your dog is [56:53] really excited about barking [56:56] then it may not work the first time so [56:59] then what do you want to do well you [57:00] want to put the dog in a situation where [57:02] you know they're going to bark but the [57:04] dog's not going to be as motivated to [57:07] bark [57:08] if perhaps a dog is right next to [57:11] a bunch of other dogs on leash and the [57:12] dogs barking going crazy [57:14] because of that situation maybe you go [57:17] oh well this situation the dog might [57:19] bark but the dog's not as motivated to [57:22] bark it's not as intense of a bark okay [57:24] great that's where i'm going to want to [57:26] start because it's going to be easier to [57:28] stop a bark that involves less [57:31] motivation than it is to stop a bark [57:34] where the dog is very motivated to bark [57:36] and then just like everything else [57:38] we can gradually increase the difficulty [57:41] as the dog understands it by making the [57:44] environment more challenging [57:46] all right i hope that answers the [57:47] question [57:50] okay what is your stand on prong collars [57:52] particularly for belgian malinois does [57:55] the difficulty of the breed make it [57:57] necessary to use in the context of [58:00] insecurity or aggression [58:03] okay if we're going to talk training [58:05] collars [58:06] with my own personal dogs and with dogs [58:09] that i have trained for other people [58:12] when i'm doing stay and train [58:14] i prefer to use a remote training collar [58:17] my dogs are trained on remote training [58:19] collars any other dog that i train i [58:22] like to use a remote training collar [58:25] because it gives me that off leash [58:27] reliability off leash obedience [58:29] i recommend a prong collar to people [58:32] that do not want to use a remote [58:34] training collar but they are unable to [58:37] get their dog to comply with a [58:39] martingale this is something i talk [58:41] about in my manual [58:43] every dog has their own bank account [58:45] some are very rich some are very poor [58:48] the dogs that are more wealthy tend to [58:51] need a higher correction in order to [58:54] stop the bad behavior where a dog that [58:56] may not be as wealthy needs a smaller [58:59] correction in order to get them to [59:01] comply so some dogs have very very [59:05] high correction levels where other dogs [59:08] you don't need to correct them as much [59:09] depending on the dog's sensitivity [59:11] so if i have a dog i like to start with [59:13] the martingales just like i said earlier [59:15] we start with the least amount of force [59:17] necessary if i have a dog that's working [59:20] on a martingale and i make a light [59:22] little leash pop and that dog goes sorry [59:24] i won't do that again great i'm gonna [59:26] stay with the martingale collar but if i [59:28] have a dog where i try to correct the [59:30] dog and the dog ignores the correction [59:33] they go i don't care about that [59:35] that doesn't have an impact on me okay [59:38] this dog i have to go up to a prong [59:40] collar [59:41] just like anything else though we want [59:43] to make sure we teach the dog the rules [59:46] before we start adding correction so we [59:48] always want to go through that process [59:50] the only time i correct a dog [59:52] for a behavior [59:54] that they have not been taught not to do [59:58] would be dangerous or destructive [60:01] behaviors if i have a dog that digs i'm [60:03] going to correct it right away if i have [60:05] a dog that wants to chase cars i'm going [60:08] to correct it if i have a dog that wants [60:10] to [60:12] bite at people's clothing because [60:14] they're hurting them i'm probably going [60:15] to correct that right away [60:17] everything else [60:19] we want to teach the dog what the rules [60:21] are [60:22] make sure they fully understand it they [60:23] know how to turn on pressure by [60:25] complying we've done leash pressure [60:27] we've taught them the rules given them a [60:28] clear path to success then we can start [60:31] adding corrections [60:32] if i'm going to introduce a dog to a [60:34] prong collar first of course we have to [60:37] make sure the prong collar is fitting [60:39] properly if you watch videos on it [60:41] you'll see they say make sure the prong [60:43] collar is as high up close to the dog's [60:46] head as possible [60:49] yes you want to do that but the collar [60:52] is going to slide down a little bit [60:53] gravity has an effect you don't want it [60:56] so tight that it's [60:58] already [61:00] implementing a correction without [61:02] applying any pressure but you don't want [61:04] it to be so loose that you can slip it [61:06] over the dog's head so we want to keep [61:09] it high it also depends let's say you're [61:11] using a medium prong collar the prongs [61:14] are about an inch long so what happens [61:17] to me every time i'm using a prong [61:19] collar either [61:20] i put it on and it's slightly too tight [61:24] or i add an extra prong and now it's [61:27] slightly too loose [61:29] very rarely is it going to fit perfectly [61:32] of course you adjust with the prongs but [61:34] what i mean is that inch whether you add [61:36] it or take it away the dog could need an [61:39] extra half an inch but all you can do is [61:41] add or take away an inch so if that [61:43] makes sense it could either be slightly [61:45] too big or slightly too small but you do [61:48] want to sit up higher on the dog's neck [61:51] if i have multiple collars on a dog it [61:54] goes prong collar remote collar flat [61:57] collar at the bottom and then of course [61:59] if you want to have the dog wearing a [62:00] harness when i introduce the dog to a [62:02] prong collar first i want to make sure [62:04] the dog knows leash pressure with a flat [62:07] collar so i'm going to do all that leash [62:09] pressure training i'm going to get the [62:10] dog to be very aware of the leash and so [62:13] they know how to turn off that pressure [62:14] the moment it's applied again it's [62:16] another tool that we can use to [62:17] communicate with our dogs [62:19] then when i put the prong collar on i'm [62:21] going to go through the same leash [62:23] pressure training with a prong collar [62:26] the dog has to know how to turn off that [62:29] pressure remember with our training as i [62:31] said earlier least amount of force [62:32] necessary but also least amount of [62:35] stress necessary we do not want to [62:37] stress our dogs out now of course if we [62:39] give our dogs a correction there's going [62:41] to be a little bit of stress but we want [62:42] to minimize any stress [62:44] and because of that we're going to go [62:46] through that leash pressure training [62:48] with the prong collar again the dog must [62:49] know how to turn off that pressure [62:51] so then if the dog is ready for [62:53] corrections the dog has a larger bank [62:55] account i can make a correction with a [62:57] prong collar [62:59] for people that want to use a remote [63:01] training collar [63:02] but they're still having a hard time [63:05] holding the remote holding the leash [63:07] because if you have heard me talk about [63:10] getting a dog directional to a remote [63:12] training collar you can't take a remote [63:14] training collar put it on a dog and just [63:17] start correcting them for obedience and [63:19] expect the dog to understand what's [63:21] going to happen is the dog's not going [63:23] to know what's causing those corrections [63:25] and you're going to create fear [63:27] if you don't teach a dog what a remote [63:28] training collar is you can use it for [63:32] dangerous behavioral issues such as [63:34] digging or getting into the trash the [63:36] moment the dog starts to dig you [63:38] stimulate the collar you get to be the [63:41] good guy what happened buddy did that [63:42] dirt bite you and now the dog [63:45] now the dog is no longer digging great [63:48] but trying to use a remote training [63:50] collar for obedience then i have to [63:52] teach the dog that i'm the one [63:54] correcting them and i do that by pairing [63:57] every single correction with the leash [64:00] so if i tell the dog to sit and the dog [64:03] chooses not to sit i have the remote in [64:05] my hand i say no i lightly pop the leash [64:09] the exact moment i pop the leash i [64:11] stimulate the collar [64:13] then i repeat the command i want the dog [64:15] to perform sit and then i assist the dog [64:18] into the sit position either with a lure [64:20] or leash pressure i'm gonna make sure [64:21] the dog's successful but bottom line [64:24] every time we correct the dog with the [64:26] remote collar we have to pair with the [64:27] leash [64:28] now that's very difficult for some [64:30] people [64:33] now that's very difficult for some [64:34] people and if that is the case when [64:36] you're first starting out i always [64:38] recommend practicing on yourself [64:40] make sure you can do it on yourself [64:41] before you do it on your dog [64:44] the remote training collars that i use i [64:46] like e-collar technology [64:48] and i like dogtra [64:50] if you watch the live cute not live q a [64:52] if you watched the podcast episode that [64:55] i did with jacob another excellent dog [64:57] trainer jacob placencia [64:59] he uses the brand i believe it's called [65:02] chameleon remote training collars he [65:05] says they're excellent he's a very good [65:06] dog trainer so i do trust his opinion i [65:09] haven't personally used those i use [65:11] dogtra and e-collar technology [65:14] okay [65:16] let's see where we are [65:19] great wolf tactic oh [65:21] very nice [65:22] oh for those of you that don't know what [65:24] that is that's a jiu jitsu thing [65:27] as many you probably already know i'm a [65:29] huge fan of jiu jitsu i love it it's one [65:32] of those things that i think if you can [65:33] do it you should do it it's amazing okay [65:42] okay i just discussed prong collars [65:50] okay i'm having a hard time getting my [65:52] friends and family to ignore bad [65:54] behavior [65:55] they behave with no manners because it [65:57] works sometimes yeah and if that is the [66:00] case [66:01] what you're going to have to do is [66:03] you're going to have to pretend like [66:06] other people that are interacting with [66:08] your dog [66:09] are just new distractions that you have [66:11] to learn how to train and work through [66:14] so i would still [66:15] just [66:17] have certain expectations [66:19] for my dog and i would reinforce those [66:22] in the situation that the dog is [66:24] currently in [66:25] a good example might be begging let's [66:28] say you don't want your dog to beg [66:30] and i posted a video on this last week [66:34] when a dog is begging often [66:36] the dog is acting a behavior [66:39] that they were rewarded for in the past [66:41] meaning we get our dogs we have them [66:43] look at us and we say if you look at me [66:46] i'm going to pay you especially when [66:48] we're doing engagement training so then [66:50] when we have our own food the dog goes [66:52] you have food i sit i stare at you you [66:55] give me food that's the deal we worked [66:57] out [66:58] if that is happening i simply tell the [67:00] dog what i want them to do i say no i [67:02] want you to go to your climb bed and [67:03] then i reinforce that so let's say [67:06] you're at the house family [67:09] they go to sit down to eat lunch or [67:10] something and let's say maybe you're on [67:12] a call and you're sitting on the couch [67:14] and you see them at the dinner table and [67:16] the dog goes up and the dog starts to [67:17] beg [67:18] well if you know they're not going to [67:20] reinforce the rules then it's going to [67:22] be your responsibility at that moment in [67:24] time to tell the dog climb and if you [67:27] need to take the dog and direct it to [67:29] their climb bed or whatever behavior you [67:31] want your dog to do maybe you call your [67:33] dog to you but bottom line is you are [67:36] going to reinforce what you want your [67:38] dog to do in any situation regardless of [67:41] what other people in the family are [67:43] doing and if you're not there [67:45] when that's taking place then it's kind [67:48] of difficult there's really not much you [67:49] can do about it at that point but your [67:51] dog will be back better behaved when you [67:54] are there i hope that answers the [67:56] question [67:58] all right let's see [68:04] yeah and so someone said i really like [68:06] prawn collars just make sure it's a herm [68:08] springer yes herm springer if you're [68:10] going to use a prong collar you want to [68:12] use herm springer [68:19] sorry i'm trying to find another [68:21] question i noticed a lot of people are [68:22] communicating with one another in the [68:24] comments [68:40] okay this is a funny one how do i stop [68:42] my dog from chasing her tail [68:45] every time she starts to chase her tail [68:48] tell her what you want her to do a very [68:50] easy one for that is going to be the [68:51] down command or come when called i'm [68:54] just going to redirect that dog to a [68:55] different behavior every single time the [68:57] dog starts to chase their own tail if we [69:00] think about cause and effect the dog [69:01] will learn every time i go to chase my [69:03] tail [69:04] i have to go into the down i don't want [69:06] to go into the down right now i'm not [69:07] going to chase my tail that's not [69:09] something i would want to correct i [69:12] would rather direct it to a behavior i [69:14] want the dog to perform so pick a [69:16] behavior you would rather your dog do [69:18] and the moment your dog starts to chase [69:20] her own tail [69:21] tell your dog what you want her to do [69:23] and then assist her if needed whether [69:25] using a lure or leash pressure up until [69:28] the point when your dog starts to chase [69:30] her own tail and you tell her what to do [69:32] she does it on her own without the help [69:34] of the physical cue and then continue to [69:36] do that and eventually she will probably [69:39] stop chasing her tail i can't i can't [69:42] guarantee it but [69:44] just like anything else if we want [69:46] reliability when you start to tell her [69:49] what to do if she chooses to ignore you [69:51] then you can correct her for that [69:53] but if you want to stop the behavior [69:55] first redirect it to something else [69:57] teach your dog that it's not something [69:58] you want her to do you can also say [70:00] wrong and reinforced with the leash [70:02] pressure or whatever you want your [70:03] marker to be and then on a long enough [70:05] timeline if she doesn't start stopping [70:07] that behavior on her own then you can [70:09] correct the behavior so just like any [70:12] other behavioral issue if it's not [70:14] dangerous or destructive so this [70:16] wouldn't be dangerous or destructive i [70:18] guess it could be dangerous no not [70:20] really [70:21] but [70:22] uh [70:23] if the behavior is something we just [70:24] don't want the dog to perform first we [70:26] teach them what we want them to do when [70:28] they do that behavior then we can [70:29] reinforce with corrections so let's use [70:32] jumping up on furniture dog jumps on [70:34] jumps up on furniture i say wrong i [70:36] guide the dog off dog starts to spin i [70:38] say wrong i guide the dog into a [70:40] different position [70:41] after enough of those dog jumps up on [70:43] the couch i say wrong the dog jumps off [70:46] the dog is spinning i say wrong the dog [70:48] stops spinning once that happens now i [70:51] know i can add positive punishment to [70:53] stop the behavior entirely the dog jumps [70:55] up on the couch no correction off [70:58] then i queue the dog off the dog's [71:00] spinning no correction [71:02] the dog stops spinning good dog or [71:04] chasing their own tail okay [71:15] easy way to teach the dog to not jump [71:17] out an open window [71:19] king jumped out the window to try to get [71:21] to me today [71:23] uh king was on the leash in the truck [71:25] and my buddy said i had to let go [71:28] okay [71:30] that's going to be a behavior i would [71:33] consider dangerous so i would correct [71:35] that behavior i would [71:37] set up a training situation where i'm [71:39] going to work with the dog on that [71:40] specific issue i'm going to make sure [71:42] the window's open enough that the dog [71:44] can jump out and when the dog tries to [71:46] jump out no correction and i will [71:48] continue to reinforce those rules up [71:51] until the point where the dog stops [71:53] trying to [71:55] what's wrong with cesar milan's methods [71:57] stop trying to jump out the car um so [72:00] someone just said what's wrong with [72:01] caesar milan's methods you'd have to ask [72:04] a specific method in order for me to [72:06] address caesar milan has [72:10] changed and he's adapted a lot of his [72:14] training over the years [72:16] if you look back at a lot of his old [72:18] videos [72:20] alpha rolling dogs [72:22] dominating the dogs those are not good [72:24] techniques it's not something you want [72:26] to do [72:28] i wrote an article about caesar milan a [72:30] few years back [72:32] and [72:34] i tried finding footage of him alpha [72:36] rolling dogs and i really was having a [72:39] hard time finding any footage i couldn't [72:41] find any if you look hard enough you'll [72:43] be able to find it but i don't think he [72:44] practices that anymore i don't think he [72:46] does the alpha rolling anymore that was [72:49] something he did a long time ago so just [72:50] like everybody else we all adapt we all [72:54] become better [72:55] and if it's not if he doesn't alpha roll [72:58] dogs anymore then i'm not gonna hold [73:00] that against him i'm not going to judge [73:01] that [73:03] i try to get people away from the [73:05] concept of thinking they need to be the [73:07] alpha [73:08] if you're in a situation it's more [73:10] important that you know what to do [73:13] instead of what body language to present [73:16] so for example often people are told be [73:19] calm confident well it's very difficult [73:22] to be calm and confident when you don't [73:24] know what to do [73:26] so it's more important for me to teach [73:28] what they're supposed to do in the [73:29] situation and then confidence will come [73:32] as a byproduct [73:33] i'll give you a quick example [73:36] uh and [73:37] i have nothing against any dog trainers [73:40] caesar milan is just very well known and [73:43] i've seen a lot of people especially in [73:45] the los angeles area [73:47] alpha roll their dogs their dog does [73:49] something they hold the dog down and [73:50] they go and they make that noise that's [73:53] not good we don't want an l for roll [73:54] dogs [73:56] so i saw him at a live event it was if [73:59] you look up um [74:01] iq i think is what it's called it's now [74:04] called impact theory some of you may be [74:06] familiar with it but it was a talk show [74:09] by this guy tom something and it used to [74:12] be called inside uh quest iq [74:16] and because he was one of the owners of [74:18] quest nutrition [74:19] i was invited to see the interview with [74:23] cesar milan i don't think they ever [74:25] posted it [74:26] after the interview and it was very [74:28] entertaining cesar milan is incredibly [74:30] charismatic [74:32] i went up to him afterwards i talked to [74:34] him momentarily and then he did a live [74:37] training for everybody with tom's dog so [74:40] tom had a little chihuahua that was [74:43] really excited [74:45] yes i do talk too much so very the dog [74:48] was very excited around other dogs [74:51] and [74:52] he needed help with it so he asked cesar [74:55] milan to help him so cesar milan brought [74:57] out his uh pit bull that he has i don't [74:59] know the name of his pit bull but he [75:01] took his pitbull and he put his pit bull [75:03] in a downstate and the dog did a very [75:04] nice downstay and then he went back [75:07] back to my question please [75:09] okay yeah sorry i i i do have add uh [75:13] what was your question jumping out the [75:14] wind yeah correcting it so you're going [75:16] to want to correct that arm and hammer [75:18] when you're set it up as a training [75:19] situation when your dog goes to jump out [75:22] correct the behavior no correction [75:24] recommand what you want and then assist [75:26] if necessary that's going to be a [75:28] dangerous behavior so i'm going to [75:29] correct it right away and i'm not going [75:31] to let the dog do it [75:33] okay sorry i want to tell the story uh [75:36] that caesar milan did [75:38] so he is telling tom he goes okay we [75:41] have to be the calm assertive leader we [75:43] have to make sure the dog's in a calm [75:45] submissive state [75:47] and the dog is trying to get to caesar's [75:49] pit bull and every time that the dog got [75:51] excited [75:53] cesar milan lifted up on the leash and [75:55] pushed down on the chihuahua's butt once [75:58] the dog sat he turned off the pressure [76:01] so he was good at that handling and he's [76:03] like see i'm in a calm position i'm [76:05] being the leader i'm showing the dog [76:06] what i want and then he started to walk [76:08] closer to his pitbull [76:10] the the chihuahua became excited cesar [76:14] stopped [76:15] put the dog in a sit the same way he did [76:17] before waited till the dog was calm and [76:20] started to walk forward again if the [76:22] chihuahua became excited caesar milan [76:24] stopped placed him back into the sit [76:27] so all he did was he made the dog sit [76:30] and then when the dog was relaxed he [76:32] walked forward so he was telling the dog [76:33] when you do what i want [76:35] we will go do what you want but you have [76:37] to do what i want first [76:39] and he continued to do that all the way [76:41] up until the point where the chihuahua [76:42] was able to meet cesar milan's dog and [76:44] it was great and people were like oh [76:45] this is awesome [76:47] what he did was was great the actual [76:49] training was really nice [76:52] but if you were watching it you would go [76:54] home and be like i gotta be the leader [76:56] and and you wouldn't know what to do [76:58] because he wasn't actually explaining [77:01] that he was using the leash and he was [77:02] placing the dog into his sit [77:05] so all he did was he made the dog sit [77:08] he said i want you to sit i want you to [77:10] walk nice and slowly and then we can go [77:12] say hi and every time you get excited [77:14] i'm going to make you sit that's what he [77:16] did and he did it beautifully [77:19] he explained it in a way that was [77:20] difficult to understand [77:22] if you make things difficult for people [77:25] to understand and you make it difficult [77:27] for them to implement [77:28] then [77:30] they're always going to need you [77:32] so one of my goals as a dog trainer was [77:35] i want [77:36] to be able to have a training session be [77:39] so clear [77:40] and effective [77:42] that [77:44] people only need a couple sessions [77:48] that's another reason why i made my [77:50] manual because if i go do a lesson and i [77:53] talk really fast i've been working [77:54] really hard on slowing down how fast i [77:56] talk [77:57] and i go to a lesson i say all right the [77:59] first thing we're going to do is [78:00] engagement training let's get the dog [78:01] engaged make sure you say the marker [78:02] before you deliver the reward we go [78:04] through that now we're going to do leash [78:06] pressure make sure you mark when the dog [78:07] completes the behavior now we're going [78:09] to teach the dog leash brett or [78:11] luring then we're going to do leash [78:12] pressure now we're going to add the [78:14] command now we're going to work on the [78:15] stay when the dog breaks you're going to [78:16] say wrong but then i go through this [78:18] whole thing in a short amount of time [78:19] and i make sure they can do every step [78:21] now if i left after that [78:24] i'm not going to remember that was too [78:26] much information in such a short amount [78:27] of time [78:28] but after the lesson they can go to [78:30] chapter seven in my manual and then go [78:32] hey what was step one oh step one is [78:33] engagement training how do i do oh yeah [78:35] i do it like this awesome beautiful [78:39] how i can do it my way uh i'm thinking [78:42] you guys are talking to each other again [78:43] anyway sorry now i'm going in different [78:45] directions here let's see another [78:47] question we have uh looks like some [78:50] separation anxiety [78:52] has chewed on the wood molding around [78:53] the front door and door knob does not [78:56] destroy anything else he is a rescue [78:59] if i have a dog that i'm working on [79:01] separation anxiety you're going to want [79:04] to do some crate training if you have [79:06] your dog out your dog is going to be [79:09] able to be destructive inside of a crate [79:11] the dog's not going to be able to be [79:12] destructive crate training is great but [79:15] in addition [79:17] oh let's see what this is sorry i got to [79:19] go to this question dog barks [79:21] aggressively [79:22] when panhandlers approach my car he [79:25] redirects to chew and thrash seat belt [79:29] what should i do [79:30] all right um [79:32] in a situation i'd have to see the [79:34] situation what i would probably do is i [79:37] would use leash pressure to prevent the [79:39] dog but if i know the dog is going to [79:41] start to become destructive and start [79:44] chewing and biting the seatbelt i'm [79:45] going to do muzzle [79:47] work i'm going to do muzzle training [79:49] that's going to prevent the dog from [79:51] being able to chew so the most he'll be [79:53] able to do is muzzle punch [79:55] the seat and that's not going to do [79:57] nearly as much damage as actually being [79:59] able to bite it and rip the seat apart [80:02] so i'm going to do muzzle training which [80:04] i do have a video on that and then again [80:06] i'm going to set the situation up [80:10] as much as possible up until the point [80:13] where the dog stops doing you might ask [80:14] yourself well how do i set that up uh i [80:17] can't leash pressure as i'm driving uh [80:19] well i'm assuming that you're parked [80:20] because you're saying panhandlers will [80:22] approach your car [80:25] you probably want to do it with someone [80:27] else in the car to help out but you're [80:28] going to have to be able to control the [80:31] dog that's going to be very important [80:34] intersection stopping at an intersection [80:36] another option is to transport your dog [80:39] in a crate [80:40] that's what i do if i'm if i'm driving [80:42] my dogs from one location to another i [80:44] used to always put them in a crate now i [80:47] have a [80:49] toyota prius hatchback which i love by [80:52] the way it's excellent with gas and the [80:54] back i have it [80:56] one of those [80:57] gates that prevents the dogs from moving [80:59] forward so they have their back area so [81:01] it acts as a kennel but a kennel is [81:03] another good option [81:06] if i if you have to [81:08] have someone in the vehicle with you [81:09] muzzle train your dog and then redirect [81:12] to the behavior that you want your dog [81:14] to perform [81:15] what's really important anytime we're [81:17] trying to get our dog to do a specific [81:19] behavior and they don't want to do it we [81:22] have to make sure that we win [81:25] we follow through a good example of this [81:28] would be [81:29] i've taken plenty of dogs on walks where [81:32] halfway through the walk the dog just [81:33] goes nope i'm not doing it anymore [81:36] and i go to apply leash pressure to get [81:38] the dog to continue walking forward and [81:40] the dog knows leash pressure but the dog [81:43] is choosing not to be compliant and they [81:45] put on the brakes even more [81:48] i'm going to use this again [81:50] so let's say i go to apply that pressure [81:53] and the dog says i'm not moving forward [81:56] then what i do is i say no [81:58] pop the leash and then i go right back [82:00] to the pressure and the dog goes oh i [82:02] need to move forward or [82:03] if i'm using a remote training collar i [82:05] apply the leash pressure the dog decides [82:08] not to move forward i press the [82:10] continuation button the moment the dog [82:13] moves forward i turn off the [82:14] continuation button yes you can use a [82:17] remote training collar [82:19] if it's fear-based [82:21] that could cause more issues not knowing [82:25] if it's fear-based or if it's [82:26] self-rewarding or self-reinforcing [82:28] behavior [82:30] then that's going to [82:32] i'm going to be i'm going to act more on [82:34] the side of caution and i'm going to [82:36] assume that it's a fear-based behavior [82:39] so then i'm not going to correct it [82:41] unless i know for certain it's not [82:43] fear-based then i can correct but if you [82:46] correct and it's fear-based you're going [82:48] to make the the situation worse than [82:51] what it already is [82:53] uh but yes [82:55] muzzle train [82:57] leash pressure training [82:59] use correction if it's not fear-based [83:02] have somebody in the car with you or [83:05] have your dog [83:06] in a crate while you transport them [83:09] which is probably [83:11] the better option because it's safe [83:13] having a car a dog loose in the car can [83:16] be very dangerous [83:19] yeah and just like bk said if it's [83:20] fear-based it can make it worse [83:24] uh the basic obedience playlist is [83:26] helping that's awesome [83:29] i really appreciate the kudos [83:32] no i have not seen the movie dog [83:36] yeah and i i'm [83:37] i'm happy that a lot of the training is [83:39] helpful and i want to keep putting out [83:41] content [83:42] more dogs so [83:44] uh [83:46] a good example is i've had people say [83:48] they've seen some of the training [83:50] techniques they tried on their own dog [83:52] and it's not working [83:54] that's why now i'm trying to i'm going [83:56] to try to do a lot of videos [83:58] of training lessons where i'm working [84:00] with different people so [84:03] common mistakes that people make [84:06] is going to be [84:08] available to view [84:10] so then it makes it easier to adjust and [84:13] fix your own mistakes because from what [84:16] i've seen when i'm working with people [84:18] a lot of times the dog is excellent we [84:21] start working the dog is very responsive [84:24] they're doing everything really nicely [84:26] i hand the leash off to the owner and [84:29] they're doing something [84:30] just slightly different than the way [84:33] that i'm maybe they're not holding the [84:34] food the same way maybe they're not [84:36] turning their wrist correctly maybe [84:39] they're not holding the leash in the [84:40] right hand [84:42] these [84:42] little differences [84:45] once they make the adjustment boom now [84:48] the dog's doing it really beautifully [84:51] so it's something i talked about again [84:53] earlier [84:54] in this episode [84:55] is to film your own training uh you know [84:59] i always tell myself i'm only gonna do [85:00] an hour i'm only gonna do an hour and [85:02] then i always end up going over because [85:04] i always have such a good time doing [85:06] this [85:07] let's see [85:13] oh interesting uh so in your state bk [85:16] the law is that you have to transport [85:18] the dog in a kennel [85:21] what which state is that [85:25] i'm happy the training worked thank you [85:26] again and all this training i didn't [85:29] make any of it up i just had the [85:31] opportunity to learn from some of the [85:33] best dog trainers in the world uh one of [85:36] my videos somebody had posted a comment [85:38] they said you're stealing everything [85:40] from michael ellis [85:42] and i was like i'm i always talk about [85:44] michael ellis i think michael ellis is [85:46] one of the best dog trainers out there a [85:48] lot of what i learned came from michael [85:50] ellis i don't think it's stealing if you [85:52] give the person kudos all the time [85:54] forrest mickey amazing trainer learned a [85:57] lot from him [85:58] bart belling i've learned a little bit [86:00] from him because you have to pay for all [86:02] his stuff and i can't find very much [86:04] free stuff but i've worked with people [86:05] that have worked with bart bellen [86:07] uh i read ivan belabonov's book amazing [86:10] trainer [86:11] tom rose incredible dave van gaarderen [86:14] incredible so i've just had these [86:17] these [86:18] really [86:19] fortunate opportunities to work with [86:21] some of the best trainers and have been [86:24] able to [86:26] translate it in a way that was easy for [86:28] me to understand and i think that's what [86:30] made it very easy for others to [86:32] understand [86:35] uh i will be getting uh three okay so i [86:38] will be getting three eight week old [86:40] puppies at once [86:43] okay [86:44] it's gonna be the same process as uh yes [86:48] tim [86:49] so if you have three puppies coming in [86:51] at the same time it's it's gonna be the [86:53] same as if you had one puppy it's just [86:54] now you got three so they're gonna i [86:56] would crate train them i'm gonna work on [86:58] potty training i would train each one [87:00] one at a time you're going to want to do [87:02] confidence building exercises if you're [87:05] starting from scratch i recommend [87:07] watching my video everything you need to [87:09] know to train your dog that's the basic [87:12] obedience series [87:13] compressed into [87:15] the shortest amount of time possible by [87:17] still providing all the necessary [87:19] information it's just under three hours [87:21] but it is a step-by-step process that's [87:24] what i would [87:25] watch and study if you're going to [87:28] be working with three brand new dogs [87:30] three brand new puppies but with puppies [87:32] i'm really big on confidence building we [87:35] always want to make sure confidence [87:37] building and playing with puppies [87:40] playing with puppies is huge so when i [87:42] get a new puppy [87:44] as i said before crate training is [87:46] important house training is important [87:48] making the dog enjoy obedience i spend a [87:51] lot of time a lot of time playing with [87:54] puppies [87:55] and i spend a lot of time building their [87:57] confidence [87:58] confidence building exercises [88:01] all that is [88:02] is introducing your dog to new things [88:05] while making it a pleasant experience [88:09] never [88:10] intentionally [88:12] scare your dog i've seen people do that [88:15] they think it's funny they're scaring [88:18] their dog that has the exact opposite [88:21] effect of confidence building it's the [88:24] same with people [88:26] we want to constantly build their [88:27] confidence [88:29] and i say that it's same same with [88:31] people too because i've seen [88:33] i don't know why people are doing this [88:36] but on tick tock people will like [88:38] intentionally scare their infant and in [88:41] my head i'm thinking are you out of your [88:43] mind why would you scare [88:45] a baby because you think it's funny for [88:47] tick tock [88:48] i don't know [88:49] okay [88:51] let me see people have issues due to [88:53] minor differences seems like it would be [88:54] good opportunity to set up services for [88:56] zoom constellations yes i do offer uh [88:59] zoom so that's a great point great wolf [89:03] um [89:04] doing the videos with people though and [89:06] showing those common mistakes i think [89:08] that's going to add a lot of value as [89:10] well so we got a lot of great footage in [89:13] thank you very much vera i appreciate [89:15] that [89:17] what kind of feeding schedule would you [89:19] say is the best for a 10 week old puppy [89:21] how many hours apart for meals should i [89:24] worry about restricting her eating [89:26] window to a 10 to 12 hour period [89:29] for me with puppies i don't worry about [89:33] um [89:35] i start to regulate how much i feed [89:37] puppies [89:40] let me rephrase that i start to regulate [89:41] how much i feed dogs so when i when i [89:44] have a puppy if that puppy will take [89:46] food i'm gonna keep feeding it and keep [89:49] training it i give puppies a ton of food [89:51] but i'm also doing a lot of play so the [89:53] schedule that i like to do and [89:56] uh and okay thank you so much for that [89:58] 60.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 427/841,i really appreciate that [90:00] uh for [90:03] new puppy that i'm training [90:05] i don't have a set feeding schedule [90:08] i feed them when i train and i take them [90:10] out and i train them as many times as i [90:12] can throughout the day which usually is [90:15] one to three training sessions [90:19] if [90:20] the only time i'm concerned about how [90:23] much a puppy is eating is if the puppy's [90:25] not eating enough but i'm not worried [90:27] about a puppy getting fat once they [90:30] become an adult then i regulate how much [90:32] they eat but as a puppy if they want to [90:34] keep taking the food and they want to [90:36] keep training i'm going to keep training [90:38] them always ending on a good note [90:41] uh you answer the person below me oh [90:43] where's your question [90:47] i'm not seeing it [90:52] our dog is acting different since we [90:55] brought baby home and is pushing [90:57] boundaries what can we do okay so you [91:00] have a new baby in the house and that's [91:03] going to have a little bit of an impact [91:04] or an effect on [91:07] the dog [91:08] i'm just going to work with the dog as [91:10] if there's nothing new in the [91:12] environment meaning [91:14] i'm going to approach every single [91:16] situation the same way i would depending [91:19] on where the dog is within their [91:21] training process [91:23] so for example let's say [91:27] you have certain boundaries in the house [91:30] where your dog is not allowed to go to [91:33] but now your dog is not [91:36] following the rules and the dog is going [91:38] into the restricted areas [91:42] i'm going to treat it the same way i was [91:44] when i was training so let's say your [91:46] dog's not allowed in a certain room [91:47] let's say your dog's not allowed in the [91:49] kitchen [91:50] but now you have the baby in the high [91:51] chair the baby's eating or whatever i [91:54] don't know where where you are with that [91:56] but like let's say that's the situation [91:58] baby's in the high chair in the kitchen [91:59] dog's not allowed in the kitchen the dog [92:01] starts coming into the kitchen [92:02] i would start i would correct the dog [92:04] for that if the dog already knows the [92:06] rules then i'm going to correct the dog [92:08] and i'm going to recommand what i want [92:10] the dog to do so the dog goes in the [92:13] kitchen the moment the dog crosses that [92:15] line no i'm gonna walk over give the dog [92:17] a correction recommend to where i want [92:19] the dog to go can you give me a specific [92:23] situation and then we'll discuss that [92:26] and i'll address that [92:28] i think that'll be more helpful [92:30] how do i get my melanoma to slow down [92:33] when tracking and also when walking he [92:36] stresses a lot and as in a hurry no [92:38] matter what the exercise [92:40] okay so tracking [92:43] i would not consider myself [92:46] a true expert in tracking tom rose is [92:49] amazing i've tracked a couple dogs [92:52] if i'm trying to slow a dog down so [92:55] i'm gonna i'm gonna give you some of the [92:56] guidance and direction that i learned [92:58] from tom rose and tom rose is [93:01] a wizard when it comes to teaching [93:03] tracking [93:04] he teaches when you first start teach [93:06] when you first start to teach your dog [93:08] tracking you want to do the tracking box [93:10] i'm not sure if you've done the tracking [93:11] box or not but the tracking box is [93:14] excellent i have a video on that and [93:16] then we're going to start doing straight [93:17] lines [93:18] the way tom rose does is every single [93:21] footprint [93:22] he will put a piece of food so the dog [93:25] smells where the footprint is and they [93:27] get the food [93:28] the same way [93:30] that we start to space out rewards with [93:33] obedience is the same way we start to [93:36] space out the rewards with tracking so [93:39] now after the dog has done some straight [93:41] lines maybe we started adding turns in [93:44] the track [93:48] are you okay this is actually a good [93:49] question [93:54] are you [93:55] rewarding your dog [93:57] when they get to the article [94:00] when i was an assistant instructor at [94:02] tom rose school [94:03] there are certain students their dogs [94:05] would track very quickly [94:07] because the dog's goal was to get to the [94:10] article and indicate because that's [94:12] where the student was giving the dog the [94:14] biggest reward so the dog was very [94:16] motivated to get to the article in order [94:20] to get that reward [94:22] and what we did was we stopped rewarding [94:24] the dog at the article and we added more [94:27] treats within the track if we noticed [94:30] the dog was starting to go too fast we [94:32] would add more treats in the track and [94:35] then once we started getting the dog to [94:37] perform nice and slow we would gradually [94:40] place less and less treats [94:44] on the track and that would usually [94:46] start to slow them down so going back a [94:48] step if needed will help and then not [94:51] giving the dog a big jackpot at the the [94:54] actual article where the dog is [94:56] indicating [94:58] i hope that's helpful again i'm not i'm [95:00] not an expert at tracking [95:02] when every time i did tracking i would [95:04] just use a ton of food to get the dog to [95:06] stay on the track [95:08] and then your other one was [95:10] also when walking he stresses a lot and [95:12] is in a hurry no matter what the [95:14] exercise [95:15] so that i'm going to treat as a [95:19] basic heel command if i'm doing loose [95:22] leash walking [95:24] and that's what it sounds like that [95:25] you're working on you're working on [95:27] loose leash walking [95:28] it doesn't sound like you're doing a [95:30] focused heel and i'm going to reinforce [95:32] that the same way i would with any sort [95:34] of loose leash walking i'm not going to [95:37] allow the dog to go faster just because [95:40] the dog wants to and that's going to [95:42] give us an opportunity to reinforce [95:45] whether we're on the step or we're using [95:47] leash pressure or we're giving the dog a [95:50] correction recommending what we want and [95:52] then assisting them back into the [95:54] position [95:55] but i'm not gonna let the dog go very [95:57] quickly in fact when i'm working with a [95:59] dog let's say [96:01] a lot of times when i take dogs on a [96:03] walk i'll go around the neighborhood [96:05] i'll go around a couple blocks so the [96:07] dog figures out that path pretty quickly [96:10] and when you start getting back to the [96:11] house [96:12] some dogs will start to speed up they're [96:15] ready to go back to the house and if i [96:17] notice that [96:18] i'm gonna continue to do the speed that [96:20] i'm doing because the dog has to go with [96:22] my speed not the other way around and [96:25] then i'm not going to go to the house [96:26] i'm going to go past the house [96:29] so i'm going to show the dog like we're [96:30] not always going to do exactly what you [96:32] think we're going to do i'm going to [96:33] change up the pattern a little bit [96:36] making healing fun should help a little [96:38] bit with that if your dog is [96:41] stressed out [96:42] have you incorporated more [96:45] exercise often when we add more exercise [96:48] in with the dog's routine that can help [96:51] with their stress their anxiety the same [96:53] you know with people [96:56] let's see [96:59] my rough collie 1.
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 428/841,5 years old is very [97:02] reactive while on leash he's cool when [97:05] nothing is happening but if a dog walks [97:07] towards us he starts pulling and whining [97:10] in excitement [97:11] okay uh and thank you [97:13] by the way [97:17] i talked about this [97:19] earlier [97:21] on this live q a [97:24] if [97:26] okay so this goes towards the concept of [97:28] generalize okay here i'm actually going [97:30] to post a link real quick if you haven't [97:32] watched this video i highly recommend [97:35] watching this video but i'm going to [97:36] talk about it as well i just want to [97:38] pull it up very quickly [97:42] okay [97:46] all right i'm going to add this in the [97:48] comments [97:50] so if you're working with your dog [97:52] you're able to get your dog to perform [97:54] and listen to you in most situations but [97:57] then in other situations it seems as if [98:00] you cannot control your dog [98:03] this breaks down the step-by-step [98:05] process that i like to follow when it [98:07] comes to working with our dog in new [98:11] environments [98:13] a good analogy would be [98:16] video games like if you ever played a [98:17] video game [98:19] think about it in the very beginning you [98:20] start at the first level the last level [98:23] is going to be much harder than level [98:25] one [98:26] progress through environments the same [98:29] way with your dog don't go from level [98:31] one difficulty to level 10 you're going [98:34] to struggle and you're going to have a [98:35] hard time you want to make each new [98:37] environment gradually a little bit more [98:40] difficult than the last environment but [98:43] a lot of times i work with people where [98:44] they're having issues where their dog is [98:46] being very reactive while on leash we go [98:50] through the normal training process so [98:51] you don't want to skip [98:53] any of the steps within the training and [98:56] what i mean by that is [98:58] i can't tell you how many sessions i've [99:00] done where they want to work on loose [99:02] leash walking or the dog being reactive [99:05] whatever it is [99:06] and i get there and they go they're [99:08] already outside they have the dog on a [99:10] leash and they go you ready for a walk [99:11] and this is the very yes jonathan katz [99:14] yeah he's awesome as well learned a lot [99:15] from him too uh there's plenty more that [99:18] i didn't mention but anyways let me go [99:19] back to what i was saying [99:21] and i get there for the lesson and they [99:22] have the dog and they're ready to go on [99:24] a walk and this is the very first lesson [99:25] that i've done with them and they say [99:27] you ready for that walk and i say no [99:29] we're not ready we have to first [99:32] show the dog how we're going to [99:33] communicate with them then we go inside [99:36] the house we work on the engagement [99:38] training we work on the luring we work [99:41] on the leash pressure after we do all [99:43] that we show the dog how to find the [99:45] heel position then we go on the walk now [99:48] i can communicate with the dog and i can [99:50] make it very clear [99:52] for dogs that become reactive [99:56] sometimes if we try to correct them [99:58] it could actually make them [100:01] more excited [100:02] and it seems as though the correction [100:05] has made the issue [100:07] worse than what it was before that [100:10] if i think that's a possibility i'm [100:12] going to start with leash pressure and [100:14] i'm going to use the leash to cue the [100:16] dog into a sit [100:18] if the dog continues to bark while i'm [100:20] applying the leash pressure then at that [100:22] point i could possibly give a no and [100:25] then correct the dog [100:26] i have been in situations before where [100:28] the dog is so excited [100:31] that even a correction [100:33] or leash pressure is not stopping the [100:36] behavior [100:37] and if that is the case and this is a [100:39] behavior that's not based on fear [100:41] then i upgrade that dog [100:44] to a remote training collar [100:46] because if we can't correct the dog with [100:47] the leash pop and it's not enough to [100:49] stop the behavior often we can get the [100:52] results that we need with a remote [100:54] training collar thank you by the way [100:56] with the remote training collar because [100:58] the remote training collar gives us the [101:01] opportunity to increa increase the [101:04] correction until the dog complies [101:07] so the way that i do that is just like i [101:10] was talking about before i do all the [101:12] obedience i teach the dog to be [101:15] directional with the remote training [101:16] collar [101:17] there's two very common ways in which [101:20] people teach their dogs how to be [101:22] directional with the remote collar [101:24] either they do it the way that i do it [101:26] where any time i correct the dog with a [101:28] leash pop at the exact moment i pop the [101:30] leash i stim the collar [101:33] that lets the dog know i'm the one [101:35] applying the correction and it's not [101:37] some sort of magical mystery force that [101:40] the dog cannot understand they go you [101:43] did that i saw you pop the leash i heard [101:45] you say no i felt the correction [101:48] another way people teach their dogs to [101:50] be directional is they pair the leash [101:53] pressure [101:55] with the continuation of the remote [101:56] collar if you watch that interview with [101:58] jonathan katz we talked about this [102:01] you use negative reinforcement [102:04] to teach the remote training collar when [102:06] i use the remote training collar i use [102:07] it as positive punishment [102:10] when we use it as negative reinforcement [102:12] again negative reinforcement we turn [102:14] pressure on when the dog complies we [102:16] turn the pressure off so when you're [102:18] teaching a dog how to be directional to [102:21] the remote training collar and you're [102:22] using leash pressure what you do is the [102:25] moment the leash becomes tight [102:28] you press the continuation button on the [102:30] collar and the moment the dog complies [102:32] you turn off the pressure but when [102:34] you're doing it as [102:36] negative reinforcement the setting on [102:38] the collar is so low that the dog can [102:41] barely even feel it they're like i feel [102:43] something but i'm not quite sure [102:45] but you pair with the leash and once the [102:47] dog sits you turn off the pressure now [102:49] the way jonathan katz does it which i [102:51] really liked is he'll just tap the nick [102:53] button so he treats that as instead of [102:56] holding down the continuation button he [102:58] taps the nick so he applies the pressure [103:01] tap tap tap dog sits he stops tapping [103:04] so the sitting turns off the sensation [103:07] that the dog is feeling from the collar [103:09] so again we use it as positive [103:11] punishment pairing it with the leash to [103:13] teach them how to be directional or we [103:15] use it as negative reinforcement and we [103:17] pair with the leash [103:19] and we can use that to get them to [103:20] become directional and i'm saying all [103:22] this [103:23] because [103:24] if i teach the dog that i'm applying [103:26] leash pressure and that's the cue to get [103:28] the dog to sit [103:30] but the dog goes i'm i'm way too excited [103:32] i'm not gonna listen to that and again [103:34] this is not based on fear then as i [103:36] apply the leash pressure i hit the [103:38] continuation button on the remote [103:40] training collar and then i turn the [103:42] collar up [103:43] until the dog stops the bad behavior the [103:46] moment they stop i turn it off [103:48] then i instantly turn the collar back [103:50] down to the setting that the dog is used [103:52] to being on [103:54] and then if they [103:55] and of course we turn the pressure off [103:57] on the leash as well so you have to be [103:59] good with your timing in order to stop [104:02] because remember [104:04] negative reinforcement only works if a [104:07] once the pressure is turned on it's not [104:09] turned off until they comply and b the [104:11] moment they comply we instantly have to [104:14] turn it off [104:15] so more likely than not if the dog gets [104:17] really excited and it's not based on [104:19] fear that's going to be the process so i [104:21] know it sounds like a lot but sometimes [104:23] when we're working on an issue that [104:25] seems very daunting we're not going to [104:27] be able to do it go through those steps [104:29] in the training process take our time [104:32] and after maybe a few weeks maybe a [104:34] month we're gonna be able to solve that [104:35] problem [104:36] okay [104:38] uh

is a gentle leader and this one is [00:30] called a halti [00:32] head halters are designed to work the [00:34] same as like a horse halter where if you [00:36] can control the head the rest of the [00:37] body is going to follow i call this a [00:39] strictly management tool so if you need [00:41] to manage a dog and you need that extra [00:44] control these are fantastic they are [00:47] very difficult to fade so if i'm trying [00:49] to [00:50] teach loose leash walking and my goal is [00:52] to get my dog on a flat collar [00:54] this is one of the more difficult tools [00:56] to fade the reason why they're difficult [00:57] to fade is it's very obvious when [00:59] they're on with [01:00] a [01:01] prong collar or a choke chain or a [01:04] martingale or any of the collars on the [01:05] dogs i can kind of loosen them up where [01:07] they're on but the dogs can't feel them [01:09] with this they know when there's [01:10] something on their nose so it's a little [01:12] bit more difficult to fade away um so [01:15] we'll start with the halti this is my [01:16] favorite headhalter the reason why this [01:18] one is my favorite is because this [01:20] bottom so this is where the leash [01:22] attaches here it's got a safety clips [01:24] this goes to the dog's regular collar so [01:26] if i was gonna put this on my dog this [01:28] part goes behind the [01:30] behind the ears and this part goes over [01:31] the nose so on my dog it look like this [01:33] my leech leash attaches to this spot and [01:36] this attaches to my dog's flat collar as [01:38] a safety so if they got this off i still [01:40] have my dog [01:43] so the part that goes over the nose it [01:46] has like this kind of pulley system so [01:48] when the leash is loose [01:50] it's nice and loose around their mouth [01:52] if they start to pull my leash gets [01:54] tight it actually gets snug around their [01:55] nose [01:57] and then i can turn their head away so [01:59] the idea behind this was wherever the [02:01] head goes the rest of the body is going [02:02] to follow so if i can control the head [02:04] and my dog were to lunge i can [02:06] physically turn their head around and [02:07] they don't have the momentum to drag me [02:08] around this is good if you have kids [02:10] that want to be able to walk your dog or [02:12] an elderly person or maybe you just had [02:14] arm surgery or you have a giant dog [02:16] again if you can control a horse you can [02:18] control a dog so this is the halti head [02:21] halter the other one is the more common [02:25] name and this is the gentle leader [02:27] gentle leaders have one part that goes [02:30] behind the head and the other part goes [02:31] behind the nose so you can see it's a [02:32] little bit simpler than the [02:34] than the halti and it's got this little [02:36] lever this little lever right here can [02:38] adjust to make it [02:40] more snug around the nose or looser [02:42] around the nose so when the dog is [02:44] wearing the gentle leader they should be [02:45] able to open their mouth and pant they [02:47] should not be able to paw it over their [02:48] nose so we'll get it fitted to the dog [02:50] so you can look at it and on this one so [02:53] if i have it fit like this for my [02:56] dog mouth [02:57] my leash would attach down here so again [02:59] as the dog turns as i pull the dog's [03:01] head is going to make that turn this is [03:02] a gentle leader this is milan muan is a [03:06] lab puppy he's very excited he loves [03:08] everybody and everything [03:10] which causes him to pull a lot when he [03:12] sees people on walks or just in general [03:14] so [03:15] he just came started his boarding and [03:17] training program and he's learned to [03:19] kind of throw his weight around so [03:20] whenever he wants something he just kind [03:22] of lowers the set of [03:23] gravity and kind of buckles down and [03:24] pulls so his owners asked us to teach [03:27] him how to wear a gentle leader [03:29] so i've got my halti here and i already [03:33] have it fit for him [03:34] so the back strap is going to go right [03:36] behind that skull on his [03:38] the bump on his skull so right behind [03:40] his ears and this part is going to go [03:41] over his nose [03:43] so [03:44] they'll sit still long enough [03:50] if you're fighting with your dog over [03:51] this you can always put some treats in [03:52] your hand [03:53] i'm going to step on his leash so i've [03:55] got some food right here so i'm going to [03:57] kind of lure him hey [04:00] so that way while he's eating i can slip [04:02] it over his nose [04:05] and buckle it behind his ears so pick [04:06] your battles [04:11] now that i've got it on him [04:13] i'm going to attach my clip to the [04:15] bottom here [04:17] and again this is a backup so this would [04:19] go to my regular flat collar [04:22] so now that i've got him hooked up i'm [04:24] just going to give him a couple treats [04:25] for wearing it [04:27] good boy [04:31] so you can see it doesn't restrict his [04:32] uh breathing it doesn't restrict his [04:34] eating he could still bite somebody if [04:36] he wanted to this is not a muzzle [04:40] so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna [04:41] teach him to give in to that pressure on [04:43] his nose some dogs as soon as you put [04:45] this on them they act like a bucking [04:47] bronco they're pawing they're flipping [04:48] around [04:50] somewhat normal so don't freak out if [04:52] your dog does that if i have a dog that [04:53] really freaks out what i'll do is [04:54] actually put two leashes on them i'll [04:56] put one on their fat collar and one on [04:58] their head halter and that way i can [04:59] take off tension as needed [05:01] to get them comfortable but you can see [05:03] he doesn't care [05:04] so [05:04] i can just give them some treats [05:08] for the sake of this video i'm not going [05:09] to but if you were at home you can just [05:11] put it on him give him some treats take [05:12] it off put it on him give him some [05:14] treats take it off and just desensitize [05:16] him to wearing it that way so what i'm [05:17] going to do to start is i'm just going [05:19] to kind of pull him forward i've got my [05:20] treats ready to reward him i'm going to [05:22] pull him forward [05:24] and just like a leash pressure as soon [05:25] as he walks towards me i'm gonna mark it [05:27] and reward him yes good boy [05:30] good boy [05:34] so this is a good example of why [05:36] although they're called gentleters i [05:38] usually don't use these a lot of times [05:40] owners think that these are better for [05:42] the dogs but the dogs usually hate them [05:44] so it takes a little bit of time getting [05:45] them used to it [05:46] so i'm gonna do the same thing level the [05:49] body he moves with me i'm a reward [05:53] so i'm gonna pull this now he's being [05:55] really good [05:57] so yes [05:59] reward [06:04] good so just walking around not [06:08] fussing with it [06:10] good i'm gonna reward him [06:16] yes [06:21] yes [06:27] good [06:30] so just walking around not messing that [06:32] that's what i'm rewarding [06:36] and now i'm going to get him to pull so [06:38] i know if i throw a tree he's going to [06:39] go dive bomb for it so i'm going to get [06:41] him to pull again he's probably going to [06:43] throw a fit i'm just going to kind of [06:44] ride it out and when he gets back to me [06:46] i'm going gonna reward him i'm gonna go [06:47] ahead and reward him for sitting [06:49] because he's usually so crazy so i'm [06:51] gonna toss my treat [06:54] yes [06:56] so i marked the moment that he turned [06:58] his head around towards me [07:00] so pull yes reward [07:04] if he walks up to the tree nicely i'll [07:06] let him get it [07:08] good job i can toss another tree this [07:11] way [07:14] yes [07:16] good boy [07:25] walks up nicely i'll let him get it [07:32] yes [07:33] good boy [07:38] good i'm gonna reward that just because [07:40] he didn't drag me towards it if i can [07:42] walk up nicely i'll let him get it and [07:44] same thing with this one [07:46] good [07:47] so now i know this dog loves people [07:49] right so i'm going to use a person as a [07:51] higher level distraction [07:53] so don't say his name so again i'm going [07:55] to give him instructions so don't say [07:57] his name don't say come but you can [07:58] puppy puppy puppy and kind of make kissy [07:59] noises at him try to get him to poultry [08:04] so i'm gonna reward him for saying [08:06] because for him [08:07] before we started he would have dragged [08:08] me over there [08:13] so again turn his head yes reward [08:17] and you notice i'm only using two [08:18] fingers it does not take a lot of [08:19] pressure [08:20] except for when he was throwing a giant [08:22] fit to get them to turn their head [08:25] two fingers [08:27] yes that's fine [08:36] now you can see he's like i'm not [08:37] falling for that one so now i'm gonna [08:38] let him go say hi break [08:41] and i'll let him get some pets [08:44] now i'm going to pull them away [08:46] yes [08:47] good boy [08:49] so if they try to lay down i just kind [08:51] of pull their head up yes and i'll mark [08:53] and reward them i don't want them to [08:54] learn how to get it off once they learn [08:56] how to get it off it's very difficult to [08:57] keep it on them [08:59] yeah i'm just going to let you kind of [09:00] pet him and now i'm going to pull him [09:02] away so two fingers pull pull yes [09:05] market reward so his head is going to [09:06] turn whichever way i pull so i need to [09:08] keep that in mind so if i'm over on this [09:10] side and i pull him his head is going to [09:13] go that way so i want to make sure that [09:14] the leash is always towards me because [09:16] that's yes that's the direction that [09:18] he's going to turn [09:19] i also do leash pressure up for sit so [09:21] once the dog is giving into the leash [09:23] pressure so again if it's on this side i [09:26] need to pull him [09:27] this way [09:28] good boy [09:29] so i never want to be like this i never [09:31] want to have it like this because that [09:32] way if i pulled his head's going to turn [09:34] away from me and i don't want to twist [09:35] his neck around so the leash should [09:36] always be closest to me [09:39] so the next thing that i'm going to do [09:40] is teach them that when i pull up that [09:42] means sit so just like i lured the dogs [09:45] i'm going to pull up with the halter and [09:46] lure at the same time [09:49] pull up with the halter lure at the same [09:51] time [09:53] pull up with the halter good starting to [09:56] fade my lure [09:58] now i'm going to try just pulling up [09:59] with the halter set relax attention so [10:02] as soon as he does it i relax my leash [10:05] pull up he sits relax reward [10:10] as soon as he gets he does it he gets to [10:12] get out of it good reward release [10:15] leash reward [10:18] release [10:19] break [10:22] yes [10:24] break [10:26] pull up [10:28] good relax [10:30] now i'm going to add some distractions [10:31] so now i'm going to throw my treat on [10:33] the ground [10:36] pull up [10:37] good [10:40] good [10:43] good [10:45] break [10:50] pull up he sits [10:52] now i can actually start my stay with [10:54] this too this is really good if you have [10:55] a super super energetic dog when they [10:57] see other dogs this is a really nice [11:00] tool to be able to help you control them [11:01] without fighting with them so this is my [11:03] distraction [11:04] if he gets up i just pull up relax [11:07] distraction he stays i reward him [11:13] my leash is short tension free [11:15] distraction [11:17] again i'm allowing him to make the [11:19] mistake even either he's going to stay [11:21] in his sit or he's going to break i'm [11:22] going to wait to see what he's going to [11:23] offer [11:29] good he's not going forward i can reward [11:31] him break [11:36] so the keys to this is don't let them [11:38] get it off [11:39] and don't pull in a direction that they [11:41] can't go so if i tighten up my leash [11:43] that's my cue for my dog to sit i will [11:45] also teach them when i pull down that's [11:47] also for a down but i want them to move [11:48] in my direction so if i pull forward i [11:51] want him to easily go forward [11:54] if i turn this way head should easily [11:55] turn that way and you can see from him [11:58] bucking and bronking and putting on the [11:59] brakes and really kind of dragging me [12:01] backwards now i can barely pull him and [12:03] he comes forward [12:07] once your dog understands the turns and [12:09] everything then i can actually start [12:11] using it for healing [12:12] and that's where again the leash should [12:14] be closest to the dog side [12:16] i would start walking i can reward my [12:18] dog for staying in position [12:20] change directions [12:22] and i can do my pull up for my auto set [12:26] so least short tension free my dog gets [12:28] out of position change directions when i [12:31] stop pull up auto sits [12:35] oh [12:36] boy when you're first teaching the dog [12:39] with a head halter it's not uncommon for [12:41] them to have a reaction when you're [12:44] trying to give teach them to give into [12:46] that kind of pressure so some dogs and [12:48] you'll see it in this video when you [12:50] start to pull on them they really [12:52] put on the brakes and they resist they [12:54] have that really strong opposition [12:55] reflex the key when they do that is do [12:58] not give in so you don't want to fuel [13:00] the fire you don't be going no and [13:02] cranking on them but don't let them [13:04] learn that pulling throwing a temper [13:06] tantrum throwing a fit gets them out of [13:08] it so if i have a dog that when i pull [13:10] they really push back and they really [13:12] buck and bronc i'm not going to give in [13:14] i'm going to keep my steady pressure i'm [13:17] going to not give in to them so when [13:19] they take even a baby step i'm going to [13:21] relax my leash and i'm going to reward [13:22] them but do not if you have a dog that [13:25] really fights it do not give in to them [13:27] when they fight if you start it you [13:28] really need to finish it unless you have [13:30] an [13:30] extreme case where the dog is [13:32] urinating and defecating on themselves [13:34] and they're really panicky that tells me [13:36] that you need to go back to using the [13:37] two leashes like we talked about but if [13:39] you have a dog that puts on the brakes [13:40] that really pulls keep that steady [13:42] tension and [13:44] be [13:45] be more stubborn they are wait for them [13:46] to just go okay fine basically that's [13:48] what rewarding with a gentle leader or a [13:50] head halter is the okay fine moment so [13:53] as soon as he goes i don't like it i [13:54] don't like it okay fine yes that's what [13:57] i want just give in don't fight it if i [14:00] give in when they are throwing a fit and [14:02] i go oh sorry poor baby and i go with [14:04] them they learn that that works that's [14:06] what turns off that pressure so we don't [14:08] want them to learn that fighting it and [14:09] pulling harder turns off pressure we [14:11] want to get that okay fine and just them [14:14] going with them and you'll see in this [14:16] video he very quickly goes from [14:18] really fighting and throwing all of his [14:20] weight to the point where he actually [14:21] gets a couple steps on me to where i can [14:23] easily guide him with two fingers thanks [14:25] again for watching i hope you learned [14:27] something new today and enjoyed this [14:28] episode make sure you like and subscribe [14:31] and we'll see you guys in the next

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 436/841,""" === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] so we've already worked on engagement [00:01] training where we're getting him [00:02] conditioned to the sound that predicts a [00:04] reward this way we can use that sound [00:06] when we start teaching him new behaviors [00:09] a fun little exercise to kind of [00:11] demonstrate how effective markers can be [00:14] is i'm just gonna walk away from him and [00:16] you're gonna make sure he can get to me [00:17] so the leash doesn't get tight and i'm [00:19] not gonna give him any sort of signal or [00:21] cue i'm just gonna wait till he sits the [00:23] moment he sits i'm gonna use the [00:25] terminal marker free i'm gonna move back [00:27] i'm gonna reward him then i'm going to [00:29] walk back and i'm going to stand still [00:30] again and what you're going to see is [00:32] you're going to see him come up he's [00:33] going to think about it he might sit [00:34] right away but we'll see he's going to [00:36] think about it then he's going to sit [00:38] once he sits i'm going to mark that [00:39] behavior again and i'm going to do it [00:41] over and over until he walks up and sits [00:43] right away so you can kind of see how [00:45] the dog is quickly able to connect the [00:48] behavior to the marker which predicts [00:50] the reward and then i'm gonna have you [00:52] give it a shot before we start luring [00:54] him into different commanded positions [00:56] sound good yeah okay storm [00:58] so i'm just gonna let him know i got [01:00] some food [01:01] because he likes food and then i'm just [01:03] gonna stand back over here [01:06] and i'm waiting for him to sit [01:09] free [01:10] and now i'm going to reward him and then [01:12] i'm going to walk back this way and i'm [01:13] going to wait for him to sit again and [01:14] watch when i say the word [01:16] so he's not going to get the treat for [01:17] that but i'm not going to do anything so [01:19] he's [01:19] free there we go when he sits i mark [01:22] again and i move away [01:24] and he's gonna stop jumping too because [01:26] he's gonna realize that doesn't work [01:29] he's trying on the other hand [01:31] free [01:33] very nice buddy [01:38] he's trying it again free [01:40] very good i love the little noises [01:46] so we'll give you a few so walk away so [01:48] he has to walk to you and then wait till [01:50] he sits once he sits mark with f-r-e-e [01:54] three and then move back and reward [01:56] beautiful and then move away from him [01:58] again [02:04] and just wait [02:06] free [02:06] so you notice on that one you paired it [02:08] you went free yeah try to say it free [02:11] then move then move it okay do you need [02:13] a couple more treats [02:19] free you got to think about it for a [02:21] second right people want to move at the [02:23] same time yeah so you're just you're [02:25] like uh [02:28] watch how i just say it then i move free [02:30] now i move it's a free there so there's [02:32] there's a slight pause from when you say [02:34] the word to when you move because again [02:36] we have to separate it for the dog if [02:38] you move at the same time you say it he [02:40] won't hear the word and we really want [02:42] to connect the word [02:44] to the marker or it being a marker so he [02:46] knows that that means he's getting the [02:48] reward [02:49] free there we go [02:51] because all we really have to do to [02:53] connect the behavior to a reward is that [02:56] the dog knows the behavior triggers the [02:58] reward free [02:59] and so even if you just moved the second [03:02] he sat down he would still connect that [03:05] to the reward because he goes i sit you [03:07] move i get the treat but we really want [03:09] to make sure we have him conditioned to [03:11] those markers because he's not always [03:13] going to see you [03:15] yeah and he's not always going to know [03:16] the rewards coming because his mind [03:18] might be somewhere else so like when [03:19] you're doing that free shaping we were [03:21] talking about earlier when you're trying [03:22] to create a proactive dog you're hanging [03:24] out inside the house he goes to his bed [03:27] you want him to know when he gets on [03:28] that bed and he hears free he's like oh [03:30] i did something right and comes running [03:31] over so it is really important that we [03:33] get him conditioned to that sound but [03:35] what i'm trying to explain is like right [03:37] now even if i don't say anything [03:39] i just wait till his butt hits the [03:40] ground and i move he'll still connect it [03:43] right but again we're trying to get him [03:44] really conditioned too [03:46] free [03:47] good boy [03:49] all right so that makes sense yeah all [03:51] right now what we're going to do is [03:52] we're going to use a concept known as [03:54] luring and just like we talked about [03:55] earlier again we're using continual [03:57] reinforcement so we're rewarding every [04:00] single correct repetition [04:02] and all i want to do is i want to be [04:03] able to show him a physical cue and then [04:05] i'm going to have you do it after we can [04:07] make sure he can complete it so i show [04:09] him the physical cue once he does it i [04:12] mark and then i reward if i notice he's [04:14] struggling to figure out what i want i'm [04:17] going to reward him for putting an [04:20] effort he's like sitting right now he's [04:22] like dude i thought we came up with this [04:23] deal [04:24] so i want him to know that he can put an [04:26] effort even if he doesn't figure it out [04:27] right away we don't want him to give up [04:29] because sometimes people for example [04:31] might be trying to get their dog to down [04:33] and they're doing this they're making a [04:34] bowl out of their hand and so the dog's [04:36] not laying down and then they don't give [04:38] it to the dog and what happens [04:40] eventually the dog goes and they walk [04:42] away they're like i can't get it but he [04:44] has really high food drive so it's going [04:45] to make it extra easy for him but that's [04:48] something to keep in mind if it seems [04:49] like he's struggling to figure it out [04:51] reward him for putting in effort but [04:53] this is a common issue where people are [04:55] trying to get their dog to down but [04:56] they're holding their hand like a bowl [04:58] if you place down a bowl of food how [05:00] does the dog usually eat the food they [05:02] stand up and they eat it yeah right so [05:04] if i want the dog to lay down all i have [05:06] to do instead of keeping the bowl [05:08] upright i reverse the bowl i make the [05:11] bowl face upside down and the dog will [05:13] go under to try to get to the treat and [05:15] they'll naturally lay down so we know he [05:18] can do a sit and i know you've worked on [05:19] plenty of other things as well but we're [05:21] going to work on the down so i'm gonna [05:23] have him do it then i'm gonna have you [05:24] do it so watch how i bring my hand down [05:26] here's the bowl now i'm just gonna [05:27] reverse it make it upside down [05:29] free once he lays down i make the marker [05:32] sound free and then i give him the food [05:34] so i'm gonna make him get up rotate my [05:36] palm free then i reward very nice buddy [05:40] and i'm going to do one more [05:44] three and notice i'm saying it once he [05:47] lays down that's when we want to mark [05:49] and going back to what i was saying [05:51] earlier technically during this stage [05:53] you don't have to mark the behaviors [05:55] but i always recommend it because you [05:57] want to get good at your timing saying [05:59] the marker and then releasing because [06:02] you're going to want to do this you're [06:03] going to want to go [06:04] free and release as you say it but you [06:07] want to say the marker then release okay [06:10] all right you ready yeah [06:16] free nice excellent job on the timing [06:20] and again that means release and reward [06:22] and we're using the terminal marker even [06:23] though he's not in a stay he's coming to [06:25] me because he's like dude you got food [06:26] you can call them too you can make noise [06:28] or whatever [06:30] let's do one more of those [06:33] beautiful all right you're a natural [06:34] what happens a lot of times is the dog's [06:36] already sitting so then the human goes [06:39] how do i get the dog to sit when he's [06:40] already sitting easy we walk backwards [06:43] and then we lift [06:44] free [06:46] walk backwards lift free [06:49] he sits fast too you're a good boy [06:52] free [06:53] very good you want to give it a go yeah [06:56] you have some already [06:59] nah [07:00] so okay [07:04] yeah so just start walking backwards and [07:06] then [07:06] now [07:08] you did good go ahead and reward him [07:09] he's like what's up did you see him he's [07:11] like baby [07:12] so uh think about there's some there's [07:14] like an invisible connection from your [07:16] hand to the dog's face and if you get [07:18] too far away it'll break the closer it [07:21] is the stronger the connection so look [07:23] out my hands right in front of his face [07:25] okay and then i lift free [07:28] and that makes it much easier give it [07:30] another go [07:36] oh free you almost had them doing down [07:38] there too [07:44] free [07:46] it's harder than it looks [07:48] i'm trying to [07:49] lift yeah so i'm just putting in front [07:51] of his face walking so i'm getting him [07:52] to walk [07:53] let's try that first just get him to [07:55] walk forward okay [08:00] i hope he has a big appetite he does [08:04] there we go good and he's almost trying [08:06] to do a little prance [08:08] frenchies are like one of the cutest [08:10] dogs but what helps is these are high [08:12] quality delicious biologically [08:15] appropriate dog food so it's minimal [08:17] ingredients and then it's raw [08:20] freeze-dried high quality so this is [08:22] like what i like to use when i'm [08:23] training my dogs [08:25] and what's also really nice about it so [08:27] like when we're doing that continual [08:28] reinforcement i like to use the dog's [08:31] kibble because if you're using something [08:33] like this and that's the only thing the [08:35] dog's eating you're gonna go through a [08:36] lot of bags but what's great is when [08:38] we're first training we're using [08:39] continual reinforcement so i use meal [08:42] time as training time if i'm going to do [08:45] a couple sessions i get the dog's bowl [08:47] of food and i'll train with that and [08:49] then in the evening i'll get the dog's [08:51] food and i'll train with that so i'm [08:52] making the dog work for everything but [08:54] what's really nice in the beginning even [08:56] when you're using kibble i like to throw [08:58] a handful of this in the mix because [09:01] when the dog randomly gets an extra high [09:03] value reward during training it ups [09:06] their motivation so you don't even have [09:08] to give them that many when you first [09:09] start out when i transition them to a [09:12] full raw diet that's what i like to do [09:13] with my dogs then i will use this [09:15] exclusively for training but in the [09:17] beginning when i'm using a kibble [09:18] because you can't train with raw when [09:20] i'm using their kibble i mix that with [09:22] it okay and it ups the motivation [09:25] because they're like getting the kibble [09:26] cool and then they get this really high [09:28] value reward like that was awesome [09:30] and then they start training again [09:31] they're like when am i gonna get that [09:32] other really high value one so it keeps [09:34] them extra motivated it's a really cool [09:36] trick [09:37] okay so now what we're gonna do is we're [09:39] gonna incorporate a couple other [09:41] commands [09:42] i like to teach a spin but it's one of [09:44] those things where you have to make sure [09:45] you like it because dogs usually like it [09:49] so they offer it up kind of like roll [09:50] over you were talking about that earlier [09:52] so dogs often like this and they'll come [09:54] up to you and they'll just spin so you [09:56] want to make sure it is something that [09:57] you like but it's very easy to teach we [09:59] just get the dog to walk in a circle [10:01] free and then reward now since he's very [10:04] food motivated you see he's making the [10:05] full circle but there's some dog and [10:07] he's also confident there's other dogs [10:09] that aren't as confident and when you [10:11] try to bring your hand over their head [10:13] they'll move away and they won't do it [10:15] or they'll give up they don't have as [10:16] much perseverance or food drive as he [10:19] does and in that case i'll reward yes [10:22] just for the dog turning their head just [10:24] putting in a little bit of effort then i [10:26] might go yes and reward the dog right [10:27] there or i can use the terminal marker [10:29] free as well at this point it doesn't [10:31] matter because we're not doing any stays [10:33] and then eventually we can do the whole [10:34] circle free [10:36] and then mark and reward so i think this [10:38] is enough for him right now we're going [10:39] to make him too full and he's not going [10:41] to be very motivated we want to make [10:43] sure we always end on a good note so how [10:45] he's looking at you right now and he's [10:47] saying are we still training that's what [10:49] we want we want to end the session when [10:51] the dog is still interested and invested [10:54] in the training we don't want to stop [10:56] when the dog is bored [10:58] that's not a good time to stop we want [11:00] to stop when they're invested and [11:01] interested because they're going to be [11:02] even more interested to come back and [11:04] train later it's something i'm often [11:06] asked when you see videos with ari or [11:09] charlie they're always really excited to [11:11] train because i always made training the [11:13] most fun training was the best that's [11:16] when we're having the most fun we're [11:18] doing treats we're playing with toys all [11:20] this engagement work so then when i [11:22] bring them out now much older dogs one [11:24] six one seven they still look like [11:26] puppies super stoked and excited to [11:28] drink to train and that's what we want [11:31] uh so any questions no then i think this [11:34] is good for this session perfect ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 439/841,""" === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we're going to be evaluating a [00:02] litter of german shepherd puppies these [00:03] puppies are a little over eight weeks [00:05] old [00:06] they are a litter of working line german [00:08] shepherds the dad is a french ring one [00:10] the mom is a french ring three and is [00:12] also a campaign three so these guys have [00:14] really good pedigrees and we're going to [00:16] be [00:17] kind of going over what you should look [00:18] for if you're going to go pick out a [00:20] puppy for both pet and for work and [00:22] things that you should look for and [00:23] maybe things you should avoid [00:25] so the first thing that i look at when i [00:27] get to go look at a puppy is i want to [00:29] see where they're kept are they kept in [00:31] a nice clean environment [00:34] because dirty puppies will usually turn [00:35] into dirty dogs so i want to make sure [00:37] that the puppies have a nice big area [00:39] that's clean that they have an area to [00:40] go potty an area to sleep and play and [00:42] kind of keep those two separate the next [00:44] question i'm going to ask is [00:46] if i can see the mom and dad and if [00:48] they're on property if the mom and dad [00:49] are not on property why are they not on [00:51] property if they own the mom or if [00:54] they're a co-owner the mom's already [00:55] been returned i'm okay with that um if [00:58] the you know dad lives right next door [01:00] and this is kind of a backyard breeding [01:02] maybe not it's not uncommon for the mail [01:05] not to be there because a lot of times [01:06] people will import [01:08] semen [01:09] and use that way you can have a bigger [01:11] gene pool and use dogs that are farther [01:12] away [01:14] so [01:15] check their environment make sure it's [01:16] clean make sure the puppies are kept in [01:17] a nice area and then ask to see mom and [01:20] dad genetics definitely matter so if mom [01:22] or dad are nervous aggressive expect [01:26] that in your puppies it's not always [01:27] guaranteed but genetics matter so [01:30] we have one two three four five puppies [01:33] we're going to be evaluating them so the [01:35] first thing that i do is i just kind of [01:37] check to see who wants to hang out with [01:38] me so i'll kind of kneel down they've [01:40] got a really big space so they've got [01:41] plenty of room to ignore me so i'll kind [01:43] of get down puppies i'll make some noise [01:45] i'll clap my hands i'll see if anybody [01:47] wants to play with me so i've got these [01:49] three came running so i've got pink [01:50] collar girl i've got black car girl and [01:52] i've got red collar girls all the girls [01:54] care and if you look over here the boys [01:56] are a little bit slow we've got tan [01:57] collar mail we've got black collar mail [02:00] but everybody's jumping on me [02:02] nobody's shying away from my hands i [02:05] want to kind of rough them up like this [02:06] not too much they're still babies but if [02:09] i do this or they go running maybe not [02:11] for work [02:12] even maybe not for pet i know that i [02:13] have a little bit more of a sensitive [02:15] dog i dropped my toy they took off with [02:17] it that's fantastic [02:18] if i'm looking for a dog that [02:21] is going to be easy to train i want a [02:23] dog that likes to hang out with me i'm [02:25] probably not going to pick the most [02:26] independent puppy that doesn't really [02:28] care about me even if they're [02:29] comfortable and confident i want a dog [02:31] that is very people orientated the more [02:34] they like you the more engaged they are [02:35] the easier they're going to be to train [02:37] so you want to see puppies that just run [02:39] up and jump on you even if you're a [02:40] complete stranger so nate you want to go [02:42] ahead and come over here and i'll have [02:44] you go ahead and call the puppies [02:48] puppy puppies [02:50] so again we've got pink girl came [02:52] running baby babies [02:55] and we've got black collar girl red [02:57] collar girl and [02:59] again [03:00] the brown collar mail's a little bit [03:02] slower so brown collar male is going to [03:03] be a little bit more independent um [03:06] that doesn't mean that he's going to be [03:08] a bad dog that just means that maybe [03:09] he's going to be a little bit harder to [03:10] train because again you're going to have [03:12] to work on your relationship he's a [03:13] little bit more independent that also [03:14] can sometimes mean that they're a little [03:16] bit more confident so again if you're a [03:17] first-time puppy buyer maybe don't buy [03:20] one that isn't super into you and is [03:22] very independent [03:23] um [03:24] yeah i mean what's not to like um the [03:27] other thing i'll do is i'll kind of [03:28] watch them interact with each other [03:29] aggression is completely normal it's [03:31] communication so if i'm again a [03:34] first-time puppy buyer maybe i'm not [03:36] going to buy the puppy that's constantly [03:38] pulling and biting the other puppies [03:41] i also want to see kind of neutral play [03:43] i want to see they recover really fast [03:45] they don't get picked on and they run [03:46] and hide in the corner so everybody's [03:49] doing really good [03:51] another thing that you can do is kind of [03:52] check sociability is hold them kind of [03:53] like a baby on their back [03:55] and see if they care if they're [03:57] screaming and flopping around then maybe [03:59] they can be a little bit more sensitive [04:01] or they can be a little bit more [04:02] dominant again with puppies if you're [04:04] looking for a pet go middle the road [04:07] all right go ahead and pick up another [04:08] one [04:08] try that black collar mail so here's the [04:10] mail to see the difference yep [04:15] they like my beard yeah [04:17] hey puppy [04:19] again nice submissive looking is perfect [04:22] go ahead and put that one down and try [04:23] this red color girl behind you [04:26] again lick lick lick nobody's super [04:28] squirmy so that's all really good yeah [04:30] they're super sweet [04:31] who doesn't love push [04:33] push [04:35] so this litter is pretty consistent the [04:37] only difference is you can really see [04:38] here the boys are more independent um so [04:42] the next thing that i usually do is kind [04:43] of check drive and see how much [04:44] motivation they have you can check with [04:46] food but i really i don't care too much [04:49] about food drive with puppies um it's [04:52] for me it's very easy to get a puppy [04:54] hungry and motivated so i really don't [04:56] care if i have a litter of puppies [04:58] that's super super food motivated that [05:00] usually tells me that i might have [05:01] problems with resource guarding um [05:04] so i and and usually kind of fighting [05:06] between the litter so i'm okay if they [05:08] don't have great food drive i can build [05:10] that i'm not concerned about that i want [05:12] to see more play drive and see if [05:14] they'll retrieve see if they're engaging [05:15] me for me that's more of a priority so [05:17] when i'm going to just drive what i want [05:19] to see is i want to see if they'll play [05:20] i want to see if they'll bite again [05:21] these are german shepherds if you're [05:23] looking for um [05:24] just a super lazy pet and maybe i'm [05:26] going to test them and see who doesn't [05:28] want to bite who's super low drive if i [05:30] have young kids in my house i don't want [05:32] a dog that is crazy for bite and tug tug [05:34] talk to tugs because they're also more [05:36] likely to bite my kids pants and things [05:38] like that so if you have young children [05:40] if you don't want a dog that likes to [05:41] bite and is super motivated then pick [05:43] the one that sees and goes ah no thanks [05:45] and wanders off that might be a better [05:47] dog for you again in this litter it's [05:48] working german shepherds i'm going to [05:49] look for who likes to bite so i'm just [05:51] going to kind of get their attention [05:55] and i'm just going to kind of make some [05:56] movement kind of back and forth this is [05:57] just a dish towel and i just want to see [05:59] who wants to follow it who wants to bite [06:03] this toy is also big enough that i can [06:04] have multiple puppies biting [06:06] i'm just going to kind of make some [06:08] noise [06:09] get it get it get it [06:10] i'm going to see there's plenty of room [06:12] for everybody to play tug so i've got [06:14] four biters here there's one that's [06:16] getting loved on by nate here i can kind [06:18] of tuck doug tug i can let it go and i [06:20] can see maybe who wins it who gives up [06:22] really fast who wants more [06:25] mr sable's late to the party [06:27] but nonetheless he got in right away [06:29] once he was over here [06:31] so again now that the prey is dead i [06:33] want to see who still cares so pink [06:35] really still cares [06:37] brown collar still cares [06:40] red's kind of playing [06:43] black collar [06:45] the two black collars kind of lost [06:46] interest so now i can pick it up again [06:48] [Applause] [06:50] and again make it run away [06:51] brown collar boys biting am i missing [06:54] one so i've got sable blackhaul over [06:56] there see how he's lost interest so [06:57] maybe if i was looking for a working [06:59] home maybe not him or maybe if i wanted [07:01] personal protection but i had young kids [07:03] i can always build up some defensive [07:05] drive later [07:06] but i don't have that prey drive these [07:08] are my prey monsters right here [07:12] again she's more into me versus biting [07:14] and i've got [07:16] pink collar and brown collar who really [07:18] want to play again i'm going to let them [07:19] win see who keeps it if they give up [07:22] you can see pink collar really wants to [07:24] win it [07:25] brown collar still kind of biting she [07:27] lost interest that person i can try [07:29] again [07:31] [Applause] [07:33] again see who's engaging [07:39] good puppies [07:42] so you can see they all like to bite so [07:43] this is really good again i've got sable [07:45] boy [07:46] who's playing in the dirt over there not [07:48] a big deal so when you go and see [07:50] puppies too ask what they were doing [07:52] before you got there [07:53] so this guy could have been out [07:55] sable boy and he could have been running [07:57] around for a full hour playing with toys [07:58] by himself while all of these guys were [08:00] sleeping so ask the breeder their [08:02] opinion hey is he normally play because [08:05] if you came to evaluate the litter and [08:07] he seems like a dud but he was a total [08:09] monster for two hours before you got [08:11] there you sing the puppies for 15 [08:13] minutes is not gonna give you the same [08:15] insight the breeder has when they're [08:16] with these puppies for the first eight [08:18] weeks so go with what the breeder tells [08:20] you as well um you know if they oh this [08:22] one's super confident and this one is [08:23] running for the hills and tucking their [08:24] tail and pooping themselves maybe pick a [08:27] different breeder but most breeders [08:28] should be honest with you like hey these [08:30] two have the most drive or this one [08:32] really has a ton of drive but he's been [08:34] playing let's you know go to starbucks [08:35] wait a couple hours and you can come [08:37] back and see them if you want once you [08:38] get your puppy home or you decide on [08:39] your puppy bring a crate for the car so [08:42] i find [08:44] after you've evaluated litter they've [08:45] been running around they've been playing [08:47] they've had a chance to go to the [08:48] bathroom they should be pretty empty and [08:50] it's a good chance for you to not give [08:52] in on crate training so if you're [08:54] driving the car you're a lot less likely [08:56] to pull over stop and let the puppy out [08:58] and give in to that crying [09:01] than if you're at home if you're at home [09:03] you're more likely to go oh my gosh i [09:04] can't stand the sound my neighbors are [09:06] going to think that i'm killing this [09:07] puppy and let that puppy out but if [09:09] you're in the car driving most depending [09:11] on how far you're driving you've got an [09:13] hour drive maybe two hours maybe longer [09:15] so it's a good chance to let that puppy [09:16] just kind of cry it out [09:18] you can ask the breeder if they have [09:20] something that smells like um like the [09:22] litter so if they have like a blanket [09:23] that they're used to sleeping on that [09:24] way they have a familiar scent and it's [09:26] not completely new um but i like to just [09:29] let the puppies cry out on the way home [09:30] um [09:31] like i said if i'm driving i'm less [09:33] likely to give in and open that crate [09:34] and reward that crying [09:36] it also teaches them to settle in the [09:37] car all things i'm going to need for [09:39] later [09:40] the next thing that i do is i start hand [09:42] feeding my puppies so depending on the [09:45] puppy i usually will hand fee at least [09:47] the first six months if i have a puppy [09:49] that's way too into me then i might [09:51] start feeding out of interactive food [09:52] toys while i'm not home to get the puppy [09:55] a little more independent but i want to [09:57] make sure that puppy knows that i'm the [09:59] one that signs their paycheck and good [10:00] things come from working with me so i'm [10:02] going to do a hand feeding um the next [10:04] thing that i'm going to start right away [10:05] is socialization i'm going to work on [10:07] taking them new places getting them [10:08] comfortable in new environments [10:10] different sounds different sites [10:11] different smells um i let people pet my [10:14] puppies if i am at a bar there's a bunch [10:16] of drunk people probably not or i will [10:19] pick up my puppy and that way when they [10:21] start to do stupid stuff i go thanks and [10:22] i can turn my puppy away and i'm not [10:24] just leaving them on the ground to get [10:26] freaked out by themselves [10:28] but as long as there's [10:31] a appropriate people that you think are [10:33] going to be good with your puppy let [10:34] people pet your puppy i usually let [10:36] people pet my puppy for the first 12 13 [10:38] weeks that's their key socialization [10:40] period after that time [10:42] i tend to stop letting people pet my [10:44] puppy so much if it's a pet and i want [10:46] my dog to continue to be super super [10:47] social i'll let people keep petting the [10:49] puppy but usually 12 13 weeks that's [10:51] when i kind of cut it off that's when if [10:54] my puppy is really friendly with [10:55] everybody i'm gonna work on focus with [10:57] me if i have a puppy that's still really [10:59] really shy [11:00] then i'm going to do really controlled [11:02] interactions or maybe just engagement [11:04] around distractions [11:06] so every pup is an individual but most [11:08] of the time first 13 weeks [11:10] let everybody pet them after that i'm [11:11] more selective [11:13] make sure you advocate for your puppy [11:15] people are really really [11:17] can be really really dumb when it comes [11:18] to puppies they see the puppies and they [11:20] want to grab them and growl at them and [11:22] kiss them and bite their ears i don't [11:24] know why puppies bring out the craziness [11:26] in people but they do so if you see [11:28] somebody getting weird with your puppy [11:31] get your puppy out of there you have to [11:33] be an advocate for your puppy especially [11:35] a powerful breed like german shepherds [11:37] if you don't protect them they think [11:38] that they need to protect themselves and [11:40] that's where you get forward fear [11:41] aggression [11:42] or even just forward aggression in [11:43] general so it's really really important [11:46] that again we got pink girl biting again [11:48] so it's really really important that [11:50] you're the one that advocates for your [11:51] puppy so if you see somebody going [11:53] and growling and [11:54] being stupid with your puppy be like [11:56] please don't and just walk away or just [11:58] walk away you don't have to say anything [12:01] other dogs i do not let my puppies play [12:04] with outside dogs that i do not know if [12:06] i have a friend who has a dog or i have [12:10] training i have other people who have [12:11] dogs that i know are friendly [12:14] or if i have a doggie daycare place [12:15] that's going to be really careful about [12:16] hand selecting friends and carefully [12:18] socializing that's all great if you do [12:20] not have [12:23] other dogs that are friendly or [12:25] access to a doggy daycare that's going [12:27] to be very picky about socializing your [12:28] puppy for you [12:30] avoid it that just means your dog needs [12:32] to be neutral they need to see a dog and [12:33] go hey what's up and keep walking no [12:35] interactions no sniffing whatever on [12:38] walks i want my dogs to be neutral i [12:40] never let my dogs they had other dogs on [12:41] walks it only takes one bad interaction [12:44] especially for a young puppy those first [12:46] 13 weeks one bad reaction is going to [12:48] completely mess up your puppy some [12:50] puppies are a lot more resilient and you [12:52] can get away with making mistakes but [12:53] with german shepherds they're a more [12:55] sensitive breed they remember things and [12:57] you're going to make problems so be [12:59] really careful when you're socializing [13:00] your puppy [13:01] find a trainer [13:03] if you get a trainer right away if you [13:05] would establish a relationship with the [13:06] trainer [13:07] and especially if they offer boarding it [13:09] makes everything so much easier because [13:10] now you have somebody that's familiar [13:12] with your puppy and [13:14] if i have to go out of town i'm [13:16] comfortable with this other person [13:17] watching my puppy because they already [13:18] have a relationship with my puppy my [13:19] puppy probably already knows their place [13:21] they already know usually the other [13:22] trainer's dogs and so when i go out of [13:24] town it's stress-free for me and it's [13:26] stress-free for my puppy so when you get [13:28] a puppy right away find a trainer find a [13:30] doggie daycare place that's careful [13:32] about socializing your puppy [13:34] and establish that relationship right [13:35] away make sure you have a home away from [13:38] home because if you get stuck with this [13:40] dog that maybe is difficult to handle if [13:42] you have a working line german shepherd [13:43] and you have no [13:46] community to help you it can be [13:48] difficult um [13:49] so those are usually my first thing to [13:50] start with um nate has tons of great [13:52] puppy videos so make sure you check [13:54] those out i'm sure you can put some [13:56] links on there for you to click on um [13:58] but start your puppy right away [13:59] socialization numbers one crate training [14:01] potty training [14:03] freedom is earned with good behavior a [14:04] lot of people give puppies way too much [14:06] freedom way too quickly and they make [14:07] problems so make sure you're setting up [14:09] your puppy to succeed good luck

They may not be the best fit for inexperienced or inactive owners."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 443/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we are back for another training [00:01] session with bethany perdome with ph [00:04] dogs my name is bethany this is foster [00:06] she is a seven month old australian [00:08] cattle dog the first thing that we're [00:10] going to train her is her name so if we [00:12] can't get their attention to their name [00:14] we can't really start on any other [00:15] behaviors so all i'm going to do is say [00:17] her name give or treat say her name give [00:19] her a treat we're using classical [00:20] conditioning to make that association [00:22] between name and food when you're doing [00:24] classical conditioning the dog doesn't [00:26] have to do anything so even if she [00:27] doesn't look at me i'm still just going [00:29] to feed her i've got a handful of some [00:31] freeze-dried treats [00:33] they're nice and small they're easy for [00:35] her to to eat and they don't get gross [00:36] in my pocket so i'm going to use these [00:38] today so all i'm going to do is say her [00:39] name and give her treat foster [00:45] foster [00:48] you can also say other words so potato [00:50] carrots foster so that way she learns [00:53] listen for her name and not just listen [00:55] for random words foster [01:01] foster [01:05] orange [01:07] carrots [01:09] broccoli [01:10] foster [01:15] foster [01:17] i try to use the same tone that i'm [01:18] going to be calling her with too so [01:19] usually when i call her i go foster and [01:21] say her name kind of soft so that's the [01:23] tone that i use if you usually have a [01:24] very strong voice you want to use a [01:26] strong voice so even if she was sniffing [01:28] grass and she wasn't lifting her head up [01:29] i would just shove the food right in her [01:30] face ideally you want to say her name [01:33] and give her the treat within three to [01:34] five seconds [01:36] if it's too much time in between they're [01:38] not going to make that association so if [01:39] i said her name and i had to walk across [01:41] the field hand her the treat she's not [01:43] going to make that association i have a [01:45] leash dragging on her just to keep her [01:46] from wandering off but if your puppy is [01:47] very distracted you can just step on [01:49] your leash and that way you've got your [01:50] hands free and that way they only have [01:52] four [01:52] feet of leash to kind of fart around [01:54] with and i can just say their name give [01:56] them a treat say their name give them a [01:57] treat again the dog doesn't have to do [01:59] anything we're just making the [02:00] association so if you say their name [02:02] you're going to give them a treat when [02:04] you aren't training think of a nickname [02:06] you know puppy puppy but you want to [02:08] make sure that you're keeping if you say [02:09] their name you're pairing it with food [02:11] name trait name treat the dog doesn't [02:13] have to do anything we're just making [02:14] the association so i usually practice [02:16] this [02:17] depends on the dog anywhere between 25 [02:19] to 75 treats [02:21] some dogs figure out really fast and [02:22] they make that association and they're [02:24] super motivated i have one dog that took [02:26] him three lessons before he started [02:28] understanding that his name actually [02:30] meant something so if you have a dog [02:32] that's a little bit slow it's no problem [02:34] just keep making that association just [02:36] like most dogs are going to bark when [02:37] they hear that knock on the door that's [02:39] because of that association we want that [02:41] same response but in a good way with [02:43] their with their name and with food so a [02:45] lot of dogs come running when they hear [02:47] you um pouring food in their bowl that's [02:49] another classically [02:50] conditioned association so i want that [02:52] with their name [02:54] whenever you go to a new place you can [02:56] always go back too so again dogs are not [02:58] good at generalizing so if i'm [02:59] practicing in my backyard i also want to [03:01] practice in the front yard out on walks [03:03] in my kitchen anytime i say their name [03:05] i'm going to pair it with food [03:07] you know when you're ready to go to the [03:08] next step when they start to give [03:09] attention to their name so when you say [03:11] their name when they actually start [03:12] whipping around looking at you that's [03:13] when you know that you've got it once [03:15] you have that attention to their name [03:16] now instead of just doing name treat [03:18] name tree i'm gonna go name attention [03:20] and then treat and this is where you can [03:22] use a marker to mark the eye contact [03:23] with a yes or a clicker and then give [03:25] them the food so now that i've done my [03:27] pairings and again this can go over a [03:29] week time you don't have to do it in one [03:31] day what i'm going to do because i have [03:32] multiple dogs i teach them to recall to [03:34] their name [03:36] and the name means attention so what i'm [03:38] going to start to do i've got a bag of [03:39] my treats over here i'm going to let her [03:41] kind of wander over and as soon as she [03:42] gets distracted and goes to pull towards [03:44] it i'm going to say her name i'm going [03:46] to back up and help her with the leash [03:48] if i need to and then i'm going to [03:49] reward her when she gets to me so i'm [03:51] going to let her kind of check out [03:57] foster good girl back up back up back up [04:00] reward her when she gets to me and then [04:02] i can use my release word break [04:08] foster [04:09] so i can use my leash back up back up [04:11] back up good girl treat treat treat [04:15] free [04:17] foster [04:18] good girl [04:21] break [04:26] so if she cheats and she checks in [04:27] that's cool but i'm gonna wait [04:30] foster [04:31] use my leash good girl [04:37] foster good girl [04:44] foster help her with a leash good girl [04:49] foster [04:50] good girl [04:52] this is a common mistake that a lot of [04:53] people do they want to use petting as a [04:55] reward when the dog has zero interest in [04:57] it so if you notice when i'm petting her [04:59] she doesn't care about me she's just [05:00] staring at the food over there so i may [05:02] think that i'm rewarding her for that [05:04] last recall but she told me [05:06] absolutely not i don't care about your [05:07] pets all i want is food right now which [05:09] is fine i just need to know what my dog [05:11] wants so [05:12] a lot of people think that they're using [05:14] positive reinforcement because they're [05:15] petting the dog when the dog has zero [05:17] interest in it so make sure you're [05:19] always aware of what does the dog find [05:21] reinforcing or rewarding in that moment [05:23] right now she doesn't care about food or [05:24] about my pets she just wants the food so [05:26] i'm going to use that thank you again [05:27] for watching i hope you had as much fun [05:29] today as we did filming this

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 446/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we're going to be teaching our dog [00:01] the retrieve over the high jump now you [00:03] want to make sure your dog already knows [00:04] how to retrieve on flat which i do have [00:06] a video on i'll make sure i place it in [00:08] the description of this video and the [00:10] first thing i want to do is i want to [00:12] get my dog comfortable and happy about [00:13] doing the jump now she already knows how [00:15] to jump so i can tell her jump and [00:18] she'll jump and the way that i thought [00:19] that jump [00:22] is i use something like a toy reward but [00:24] i make it fun we don't want to put too [00:26] much pressure on our dog we can also [00:28] place the toy in front of the jump and [00:30] then we can tell our dog to get the toy [00:32] we can release them and encourage them [00:34] to jump over so it helps get them used [00:36] to having the toy in their mouth when [00:37] they make the jump [00:40] i can even use the command that i use [00:42] for the retrieve bring [00:45] very good nice job ari [00:50] bring [00:52] very good good girl [00:54] nice job [00:56] bring [00:57] excellent and good [01:00] spring [01:01] very good and you want to make sure [01:02] they're jumping if they pick up the item [01:05] and they go around don't make a big deal [01:06] about it reset and do it again and [01:08] really encourage them and praise them [01:10] when they make the jump the way that you [01:11] want then we can hold our dog back throw [01:14] it bring release so they grab it and [01:17] bring it back encourage them to go [01:19] through the jump [01:20] and then play a little bit more tug very [01:22] nice ari out [01:25] bring [01:27] by holding her back i'm creating a [01:28] little bit of frustration which gets her [01:31] excited to go and get the toy the main [01:33] thing i'm focusing on on this part of [01:35] the exercise is that she's going over [01:37] the jump she's picking up the toy and [01:38] she's carrying the toy over the jump [01:40] while creating that strong positive [01:42] association she loves playing tug so [01:45] this makes it very fun which is going to [01:47] transfer over pretty nicely when we have [01:50] her doing the retrieve for the dumbbell [01:52] now what we're going to do is we're [01:53] going to do an exercise known as back [01:56] chaining i broke down the 10 steps that [01:58] i like to follow when teaching the [02:00] retrieve and now i'm going to [02:01] incorporate a little bit of that when we [02:03] introduce the high jump to our dog now [02:06] if you notice i have some ring gates [02:08] lined up and that's to prevent my dog [02:10] from making any mistakes as far as going [02:12] around or skipping the jump our dogs are [02:15] going to take the path of least [02:17] resistance so we want them to go over [02:19] the jump and not start creating the [02:21] habit of going around when we're doing [02:23] the step and we're using the tug toy if [02:25] they go around not a big deal but i want [02:27] to make sure they know they have to go [02:29] over the jump when they go to retrieve [02:31] the item and when they come back to give [02:33] the item back to me so just like kamari [02:37] so she likes jumping it [02:40] we want to have the dog right in front [02:41] of us we want to get them holding the [02:43] item bring [02:44] and we want them to be able to walk with [02:46] that come to the sit front position heel [02:49] i even like them to do obedience [02:51] commands free with the dumbbell in their [02:54] mouth so they get used to holding it and [02:56] executing these commands very simple [02:59] commands but when we put it all together [03:01] it comes into a nice retrieve i'm gonna [03:03] put her in a sit [03:05] then i'm going to set the dumbbell in [03:06] front of her sit [03:09] now i'm going to tell her to bring it to [03:11] me so she has to pick it up and then [03:13] come sit directly in front of me and i [03:16] can help with my body language as much [03:17] as i need in order to get her into that [03:19] sit front position [03:21] bring [03:25] out [03:26] free and now i can reward her for doing [03:28] that exercise [03:30] heel sit [03:34] same thing [03:39] bring [03:42] out [03:44] heel [03:46] free this time i had her come into the [03:47] heel position [03:49] sit repeat the sit command step out in [03:52] front of her [03:56] bring [03:58] and of course this is possible because [04:00] we've done the retrieve on flat out free [04:03] so it makes it much easier that's why [04:05] you want to make sure you teach your dog [04:07] the retrieve on the flat before you [04:08] introduce the retrieve over the jump and [04:10] now we're going to start introducing the [04:13] item behind her so i'm gonna bring her [04:16] into a sit front right here and i'm [04:17] gonna have the dumbbell sitting behind [04:19] her so she's gonna have to turn around [04:21] grab it and then come back to me and [04:23] then we're gonna place it on the other [04:24] side as well so [04:26] ari come [04:28] sit [04:30] come [04:30] sit [04:38] bring [04:42] free that time i said free when i grab [04:45] the item rewarding her and releasing her [04:47] at the same time heel [04:49] sit [04:50] so now all you can see is we're just [04:52] adding and making it slightly more [04:54] difficult each time i'm going to place [04:57] it on the opposite side of the jump i'm [04:59] going to let her see it and now i'm [05:01] going to tell her to bring it to me so [05:03] i'm going to give her the command while [05:05] she's right there so it's a very similar [05:07] picture that we did before but now the [05:08] jumps in front of us [05:11] bring [05:16] out [05:16] free very nice [05:18] that time i said out and then i rewarded [05:20] her for releasing it heal [05:23] sit [05:24] now i'm going to place it in front of [05:26] her [05:27] and i'm going to go on the opposite side [05:29] of the jump so i'm just changing the [05:31] pitcher ever so slightly each time and [05:33] i'm building up on her success [05:36] bring [05:41] out [05:42] sit [05:43] and now i'm going to do the same thing [05:45] set it in front [05:48] because we also want to get her used to [05:51] grabbing the dumbbell and jumping over [05:53] the platform now that it's in that [05:55] position again i want her to get used to [05:58] picking up the item [05:59] jumping with it in her mouth and then [06:01] coming to the sit front position [06:04] bring [06:08] free [06:09] very good ari and right there i marked [06:12] when i grabbed it telling her that she [06:14] did it correctly she can release and i'm [06:16] going to give her a reward after doing [06:18] this for a few weeks then i'm going to [06:20] remove the ring gates and i'm going to [06:22] do this exercise with just the jump if [06:25] you want to pick up some of this [06:26] equipment to start training yourself i [06:28] highly recommend jj dog supplies i'm [06:30] going to make sure that i put a link in [06:32] the description of this video so if [06:34] you'd like to order some ring gates or [06:35] any of their agility equipment you'll be [06:37] able to do that now the very last step [06:39] before i officially remove the ring [06:41] gates is i want the dog to do the entire [06:44] exercise as if we were doing this in a [06:46] competition so i want her to be in heel [06:50] i'm going to throw the dumbbell once it [06:52] stops moving i'm going to give her the [06:53] one command to bring she will go [06:55] retrieve it come back into the sit front [06:57] i'm going to take it from her then i'm [06:59] going to ask her to come into the heel [07:00] position it should look something like [07:02] this [07:13] out [07:15] heel [07:18] free very nice good girl [07:22] now we're going to do it one more time [07:23] without the ring gates now for the last [07:26] step i've removed the ring gates if for [07:28] some reason she decides to go around it [07:30] to go get the dumbbell i'm going to [07:31] encourage her to jump over it by moving [07:34] forward and talking to her doing [07:35] whatever i have to do to get her to jump [07:37] the jump and then i'm going to put the [07:39] ring gates back up and i'm going to do [07:40] some more repetitions with the ring [07:42] gates in order to build that muscle [07:44] memory so she doesn't start thinking [07:46] it's okay to go around it but if she [07:47] does i'm not gonna make a big deal about [07:49] it i would encourage her to jump back [07:50] over good girl put the ring gates back [07:53] up and i'm gonna go back to work sit [08:00] bring [08:05] [Music] [08:07] out [08:09] kill [08:12] very good [08:14] nice job ari [08:19] [Music] [08:30] [Music] [08:39] [Music] [08:53] [Music] [09:01] you

Fun Fact: Long-haired dachshunds, known for their lively and energetic disposition, are prone to shedding their undercoat heavily on a semi-annual basis, a phenomenon known as ""blowing their coat."" As a result, they necessitate regular grooming to maintain their long, silky coats. While their shedding may seem like a hassle, they are relatively low maintenance in terms of bathing and only require a bath every few months."
document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 451/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we are back in riverside [00:02] california with professional dog trainer [00:04] bethany perdome at her business ph dogs [00:08] and we're gonna be doing some training i [00:09] have dallas here she's a little [00:10] miniature dachshund and she is scared of [00:13] life so she's here for our board and [00:15] train program and i'm going to explain [00:16] how to introduce a scared dog to a new [00:18] person so i've got my dog on a leash and [00:20] that way they can't run away from me [00:21] they can't go hide i don't want them to [00:23] to be too scared [00:25] i'm going to kneel down i'm going to [00:26] turn my body perpendicular to her so i'm [00:28] not going to lean over her and i'm gonna [00:30] kind of put my hand out if she wants to [00:31] sniff if she you can see she's like [00:33] let's go to the exit so i'm gonna kind [00:35] of pull her a little bit towards me if [00:36] she takes a step i'm gonna relax my [00:37] leash i'm gonna ask for a little bit [00:39] more relax my leash [00:41] see if she wants to sniff good girl [00:47] good if she's still staying away i can [00:49] ask a little bit of leash pressure she [00:51] walks towards me relax my leash [00:53] whenever you're going to pet a scared [00:55] dog for the first time always going to [00:56] want to go under their chin so if i [00:57] reach over that can be very scary [00:59] especially for very small dogs [01:01] so i'm going to put my hand under and [01:03] i'm going to just scratch right under [01:04] here [01:07] then i can slowly kind of work around to [01:09] the side [01:10] see if they have any favorite spots [01:13] and then what i'm going to do is she's [01:14] tolerate tolerating it really well so [01:16] now i'm going to take away some tension [01:18] i'm going to walk away from her [01:21] i'm going to kneel down and try it again [01:24] see if she wants to come towards me she [01:25] doesn't so i'm going to pull her just a [01:26] little bit she gives into leash relax [01:29] pull her a little bit more [01:31] she gives in i relax [01:34] good curious [01:39] a couple pets take away the tension walk [01:41] away so every time i let her walk i'm [01:43] letting her kind of shake it off and get [01:45] rid of any stress if i stay with her for [01:47] too long and i'm putting too much [01:48] pressure on her she can get overwhelmed [01:51] i call that an ocean so some dogs will [01:54] come up they'll take your food and they [01:55] go oh and then they react they had [01:58] motivation for the food but once the [01:59] food is gone they say oh and then they [02:02] get really nervous and that's where some [02:03] dogs will take food and then they go to [02:05] bite because their motivation for the [02:07] food was there but then the fear was [02:09] more after the food is gone because now [02:11] they're stuck here with this person so [02:13] if i have a dog that's very nervous [02:15] sometimes i won't i should say a very [02:17] nervous dog that will react and bite i [02:19] will not use food initially i'll just [02:21] get them comfortable because sometimes [02:23] when you use food they they put [02:25] themselves in a predicament where they [02:27] are braver because of the food but then [02:28] once the food is gone they get really [02:30] scared and that's where they're more [02:31] likely to bite so again just a little [02:32] bit of leash pressure good relax [02:35] pet under the chin [02:39] good girl [02:41] and this is where you want to kind of [02:42] play harder to get so a lot of people [02:43] like oh the dog's letting me pet them [02:44] and then they pet the dog all over and [02:46] they just smother the dog with pets you [02:48] want to play hard to get so i want to [02:50] leave them wanting more so then i'll [02:52] kind of walk away [02:58] under the chin [03:01] a little bit of pets walk away [03:05] better kind of get rid of some [03:07] stress let her exercise let her kind of [03:09] shake it off [03:12] kneel down again [03:14] invite her to come towards me [03:16] a little pull good [03:18] now that she's a little bit more [03:19] comfortable i'm going to see if she'll [03:20] take food again [03:24] good so this is a good gauge of comfort [03:28] right so dogs won't eat when they're [03:30] stressed so when she first came out she [03:33] didn't want my treat i walked around a [03:35] little bit i did some under the chin [03:36] pets i let her stiff me i did a little [03:38] bit of leash pressure to get her to come [03:39] towards me and now she's comfortable [03:41] enough that she'll take food if the dog [03:43] will not take food from your hands [03:45] sometimes we'll take it off the ground [03:46] so you can try putting the treat down [03:48] and then walking away [03:50] this is what we call treat and retreat [03:52] so i'm gonna treat her and i'm gonna [03:54] retreat and walk away i'm gonna kind of [03:56] pull her towards me [03:57] she comes to me give her the treat [04:00] and then i'm going to retreat i'm going [04:02] to walk away [04:04] she comes towards me [04:06] i give her the treat and again i can [04:08] just put it on the ground these treats [04:09] are pretty good big for her she's the [04:11] treat i retreat [04:13] so treat and retreat [04:15] so what i don't want to do with a scared [04:17] dog is i don't want them to come and [04:18] take my food and they grab the treat in [04:20] the dash [04:22] right a lot of dogs will do that they [04:23] come they snatch it and they run away so [04:24] by doing the treat and retreat i'm the [04:26] one who's walking away [04:28] and that allows the dog to be forward [04:30] because with scared dogs i want them to [04:32] be forward to treat and i retreat [04:35] then again for a small dog these streets [04:37] are a little bit big [04:47] can i can use my [04:49] leash when she's done chewing [04:51] if she were to get stuck out there i can [04:53] just do gentle leash pressure [04:55] good [04:57] treat and i retreat now if you notice [04:59] i'm starting to kind of stand over her [05:01] so i'm trying to add a little bit more [05:02] pressure on her so i'm standing more [05:04] forward i'm bending over she treats i [05:06] take off the pressure i walk away [05:10] i'm bending over her giving her the [05:12] treat i take off the pressure i walk [05:14] away [05:18] good job little lady [05:20] once you have a scared dog that's [05:21] comfortable with you it's time to start [05:22] to introduce them to other people [05:24] so i've got a slip lead on her so that [05:26] way she can't back out and get out of [05:27] her collar so what i'm going to do is [05:29] i'm going to have nate turn and kneel [05:31] down so you're perpendicular to her and [05:33] then i'm going to just hand him the [05:35] leash and then i'm going to back away so [05:37] when i back away the dog is going to [05:39] want to follow me that's normal so do [05:41] you have some treats in your hand nate i [05:43] do okay so he's going to get some treats [05:44] ready [05:48] and [05:49] go ahead and just kind of pull her a [05:50] little bit towards you [05:52] good [05:55] so as soon as she takes just a step [05:56] towards you can relax the leash [05:58] good and then go ahead and just toss [06:00] with the treat and we'll see if she'll [06:01] eat it [06:03] good [06:05] and then go ahead and just pull her a [06:06] little bit more [06:10] come on baby [06:16] good [06:17] so again in that one little step you [06:18] relaxed the leash [06:20] and rewarded [06:22] i'll see if she'll take one from my hand [06:30] good and then i would perfect so i was [06:31] gonna say i was gonna walk stand up walk [06:33] away let her kind of [06:35] get rid of some stress [06:37] and you notice now i'm her safety [06:39] blanket right so before she was scared [06:41] of me and now she's running and trying [06:42] to jump on me that's normal i'm just [06:44] gonna ignore her [06:47] she has to be friends with everybody [06:48] else too [06:51] so her owner was complaining about a lot [06:53] of treats yep there you go [06:55] so her owner was complaining about [06:56] barking she said this dog barks at [06:58] everything stop the barking we wanted to [06:59] be quiet with her barking is a symptom [07:02] of her fear so whenever she gets scared [07:04] she sounds the alarm so she barks at [07:06] other dogs at people at noises at things [07:08] that she finds strange or scary so we're [07:11] building up her confidence and by doing [07:13] that the barking will go away because [07:15] the barking is a symptom of her fear the [07:17] barking is not the problem [07:21] that was probably a good session for her [07:23] yep [07:23] so then again that's that's right you [07:25] want to end on a good note so if i [07:26] pushed it to the point where you ran a [07:28] treat she was full she somebody made a [07:30] loud noise or something and she got [07:32] really freaked out i'm gonna end on a [07:33] bad note so i want to try to end while [07:35] she's [07:36] she was taking food from you she was [07:38] approaching you she wasn't running for [07:40] the hills she wasn't bolting towards me [07:42] so that's a good note to end on so even [07:44] if you have people over to your house [07:45] the dog doesn't need to hang out the [07:46] whole time i can give my dog break so i [07:48] can invite my people in show them what [07:50] to do give them some treats bring my dog [07:52] down for five ten minutes max if i want [07:55] have a good experience and put the dog [07:57] up maybe an hour later i can bring the [07:59] dog down again have everybody already [08:01] have the treats have everybody feed the [08:02] dog and put the dog up i would rather do [08:05] that and have short control lessons or [08:08] sessions with the people then say we're [08:10] watching football all sudden someone [08:11] stands there there's a touchdown and the [08:12] dog goes running and barking the other [08:14] room and all my work just went out the [08:15] window some dogs recover very quickly [08:18] some dogs those things matter so if you [08:19] have a dog that is very sensitive [08:22] it's better to keep it short and sweet [08:24] and on a good note and put the dog away [08:25] while they're being successful don't [08:27] push it to the point where people are [08:28] like okay now i'm gonna do two hands and [08:29] and go love on the dog or try to kiss [08:31] the dog in the face so try to end on a [08:32] good note and even though this is [08:34] working on a behavioral issue as far as [08:38] fear goes it's still training and so [08:40] it's a training session that you're [08:41] doing so just like any training as you [08:43] said which is an important note as you [08:44] want to keep it short you want to keep [08:46] it nice and sweet and as you said ending [08:48] on a good note [08:49] people make that mistake all the time [08:51] they have their dog out just like you [08:52] said and they're like well we got to [08:53] keep the dog out all the time and now [08:55] it's an environment where they think [08:57] they're benefiting the dog but they're [08:58] overwhelming the dog it's too much and [09:01] it's for too long of a period of time [09:03] that's right and also everybody has [09:05] their opinion about dog training you can [09:06] ask four different people even four [09:08] different trainers how you do one thing [09:09] and they're all gonna give you different [09:10] answers it's not that one is right or [09:12] one is wrong but you know your dog's [09:14] best you have to be their advocate so if [09:16] you know that uncle joe always drinks a [09:18] lot and gets super loud and thinks that [09:20] he [09:21] knows more about dogs for me it's not [09:23] worth uh getting into a family feud over [09:26] something or i have a strong opinion on [09:28] it right so it's not worth me ruining my [09:30] relationship with that person it's [09:31] better for me to go here uncle joe give [09:33] the dog some trees thank you so much for [09:34] helping okay i'm gonna go put the dog [09:36] away now i already took him for a hike [09:37] i've got a bully stick or a stuff kong [09:39] or something for my dog to do i don't [09:41] want them to think that i'm just locking [09:42] them up it's like good things happen [09:43] also [09:44] when you're put away but not every dog [09:46] is designed [09:47] would enjoy or should be [09:50] hanging out during thanksgiving dinner [09:52] or christmas you have people that are [09:53] going to feed your dog from the table [09:54] people that are going to stare at the [09:56] dogs kids they don't know what happens [09:57] if i blow in the dog's face you know [09:59] kids are gonna be kids dogs are gonna be [10:00] dogs drunk uncle joe's gonna be drunk [10:02] uncle joe right so it's better if you [10:04] know that these people don't follow [10:05] directions [10:07] they they're not ready to hang out with [10:08] my dog and with the dog that does have [10:10] fear issues what are some other [10:12] confidence building exercises that you [10:14] like to do with dogs that is [10:16] transferable to other issues where they [10:19] may be less afraid to build it up in one [10:21] area to transfer it to another part so i [10:24] i like to [10:25] prepare my dogs for all the weird things [10:27] that people are going to do to them so [10:29] if people are going to bend over my dog [10:31] i want to train that so i can [10:33] desensitize my dog to that so like she [10:35] didn't like the two hands coming towards [10:37] her so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna do [10:39] two hands [10:40] and then a treat [10:41] so i'm not going so close to her i'm [10:43] just showing her that picture and then [10:44] now that's a precursor to something good [10:46] happening now this next time i'm gonna [10:48] go a little bit closer and i'm gonna [10:51] reward her [10:52] so now instead of two hands coming [10:53] towards you being something that's scary [10:55] and sending her to back away she's oh [10:57] something good happens when two hands [10:58] come towards me and that would be a [11:00] great example of counter conditioning [11:02] exactly you're taking something that she [11:04] may have been afraid of and now you're [11:05] making it predict something pleasant and [11:06] that's something people could do with [11:08] anything that they notice their dog [11:09] might be afraid of but starting of [11:11] course as you did farther away so [11:12] smaller steps than increasing yeah and [11:15] although like i was explaining the video [11:16] to put your hand under the chin versus [11:18] reaching over i want to desensitize my [11:20] dog to that and you can see when i did [11:22] that she lowered her head down right so [11:24] again i'm going to counter condition [11:26] desensitize her and if i wasn't talking [11:29] i'd be marking it with a yes so i'll do [11:31] it this time so i'll wait till she's [11:33] paying attention [11:35] yes [11:36] reward [11:38] if i know that people are going to go [11:40] what a dog right again [11:42] running to the hills right and that's [11:44] with me that she likes so if i can't go [11:46] high and scruff my dog's head i can't [11:48] expect her to tolerate that from a new [11:50] person so we'll work through that that's [11:52] a perfect example so i'm doing the [11:54] waving over my dog's head in a tree [11:57] so dogs aren't made of glass a lot of [11:59] people go oh my god let's stop like that [12:00] was too much she went running look she's [12:02] just eating right so [12:04] don't be afraid don't [12:06] don't overwhelm your dogs if they're [12:08] pooping themselves and peeing themselves [12:09] and they're not recovering obviously [12:11] it's too much but i know that i can work [12:13] through this issue with this dog right [12:14] now so a lot of people see that i go oh [12:16] my gosh dogs can't have fear fear is [12:18] part of it right the dog is fearful if [12:21] we never [12:22] stress them a little bit but have them [12:23] be successful it's very difficult to [12:26] have any kind of growth right stress and [12:28] growth is together if you never go [12:30] outside of your comfort zone you're [12:31] never going to grow as a person so i [12:33] don't want to be scaring the snot out of [12:34] her every single time i know for her [12:35] that was way over threshold that was [12:37] more than she could tolerate right it [12:39] sent her running but i'm going to build [12:41] on it so [12:43] just a little one like that then again [12:45] food comes after and in the beginning [12:47] when she was first coming out [12:49] something that's important which a lot [12:51] of people end up doing [12:53] instinctively is looking at the dog [12:56] making eye contact which it's good to [12:58] build up on that but if the dog is very [13:01] fearful [13:02] just like turning away from the dog as [13:04] you said earlier not having direct eye [13:06] contact in the beginning is also [13:07] important the dog is afraid of that [13:09] using the counter conditioning may be [13:10] looking and then marking and rewarding [13:12] and taking that pressure off of the dog [13:14] simply by looking away yep and just like [13:16] we do duration for stay it's the same [13:19] thing for eye contact so i'm gonna look [13:20] one second reward and look away [13:23] two seconds reward and look away build [13:25] up to five seconds until i can sit there [13:27] and just stare at my dog's face and be [13:29] like food is coming food is coming it's [13:30] no longer a threat i'm no longer [13:32] challenging they're like anytime [13:34] somebody stares at me it's again food is [13:36] gonna come [13:37] and she's doing great i mean she seems [13:39] to be way more relaxed [13:41] just off of this short session yep yeah [13:44] and with her it's not gonna be something [13:46] that happens overnight it's going to be [13:48] again dogs are very bad at generalizing [13:50] so i need to be able to do all these [13:51] things to her you need to be able to do [13:53] all these things here and then we go to [13:54] the front yard and we do it and we go to [13:55] the store and we do it and then i have [13:56] another person do it dogs need to have [13:59] say about 50 to 100 people do it before [14:01] like okay people are good a lot of times [14:04] people have access to that number of [14:05] people which again which is why i [14:07] usually recommend boarding and training [14:08] programs because whenever somebody comes [14:10] up to drop off a dog here pet this dog i [14:12] can put the dog away i've got my [14:13] employees i've got people that come for [14:14] tours i go to in-home lessons we take [14:17] the dogs out sometimes a socialization [14:19] uh training lesson is going to starbucks [14:22] and just hanging out for as long as it [14:23] takes before my dog lays down [14:25] and when my dog finally settles and lays [14:27] down on their own that tells me that [14:29] they're relaxed enough to be comfortable [14:31] enough to lay down me telling my dog is [14:33] different than them offering that calm [14:34] behavior so if it takes me two hours [14:36] that means i'm sitting at starbucks for [14:37] two hours and waiting for them to go [14:40] okay i'm comfortable enough and relaxed [14:42] enough that i can offer this more [14:43] submissive position and relax and once [14:46] they lay down okay now we get to go home [14:47] so again they offer that calm position [14:49] and they get out of there so they learn [14:51] the faster they settle the faster they [14:52] get to go home and that makes me think [14:54] of another common question that people [14:56] have when it comes to doing this type of [14:57] training really any training [15:00] how do they know when to move forward [15:01] how do they know when to [15:04] put a little bit more pressure on the [15:05] dog what certain signs or body language [15:08] do you look at with a dog when you're [15:10] working on these fear issues a lot of it [15:12] is just [15:13] unfortunately just experience a lot of [15:15] it but whenever something's a piece of [15:17] cake you need to move on so if you're at [15:19] a park and your dog is scared of kids [15:21] and you're so far away the dog has [15:24] zero interest is just staring at your [15:26] food you need to make it harder you need [15:28] to get closer they need to be aware of [15:30] whatever it is that they're scared of if [15:32] if i have a dog that is just so focused [15:34] on my treats and i'm you know 200 yards [15:38] away i'm just wasting my time the the [15:41] threshold that i like to train at is [15:42] where the dog is aware [15:45] but they're able to be successful [15:47] i want my dog to go okay there's a guy [15:49] there mom do you see there's a guy there [15:50] and a little bit of stress but i want to [15:52] make sure that i'm able to end on a good [15:54] note i don't like i said i don't want to [15:56] push them to the point where they're [15:57] running for the hills or they're barking [15:59] and lunging and they're really freaking [16:00] out i want where they're a little bit [16:02] stressed but they're able to be [16:03] successful and if someone does progress [16:06] too quickly [16:07] what's a good recommendation for them as [16:09] far as [16:11] fixing what they may have you can always [16:13] go back [16:14] a lot of people are always scared to [16:16] kind of take a couple steps back but you [16:18] can always go back you can always go [16:19] back to your foundation so if i have a [16:22] dog that is scared of kids and i got to [16:25] where i was within 20 feet of the [16:26] playground but then school got out and [16:28] 40 kids ran my dog was like oh my gosh [16:31] and freaked out that's fine i'm going to [16:32] add more space but i'm not going to end [16:34] on that bad note i'm going to find a [16:37] distance where my dog is comfortable [16:39] where they can be successful where [16:40] they're aware of it but they're able to [16:42] take food where they're able to kind of [16:43] process they're able to lay down they're [16:45] able to give me some eye contact and [16:47] maybe do some short little fun behaviors [16:49] and then i'm going to leave [16:50] so a lot of people want to get scary [16:52] when it gets where the dog is acting out [16:55] they want to run home that's where you [16:56] really need to start training [16:58] so don't freak out if they progress too [17:02] quickly go back a couple steps even [17:04] three if that's what's needed and then [17:06] work your way back up sorry i had to fly [17:07] on my head yeah it's always okay to go [17:09] back you want to work on your dog's pace [17:11] so they may have a great week and then [17:13] they have a really bad week that's part [17:14] of it so a lot of people don't realize [17:16] that mistakes are part of training [17:18] if i keep my dog in this little perfect [17:20] bubble and i only take them out for [17:22] walks when there's no other dogs around [17:24] and i only introduce them to the same [17:25] five people if my life is like that and [17:28] i live in a bubble and i only walk my [17:29] dog at midnight because that's my work [17:31] schedule that's fine but if you want to [17:33] be able to take your dog out if you want [17:34] to be able to introduce them to people [17:35] you need to practice those things thanks [17:38] for watching i hope you enjoyed today's [17:39] video make sure you leave a comment hit [17:41]

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 455/841,com forward slash nate don't [01:55] wait get started today [01:58] so like that's a position down's a [02:00] position sits a position is the sit [02:02] front position heel is the position off [02:05] to our side so then i reinforce that's [02:07] my heel stay that space right on my left [02:09] side if i'm walking the dog has to walk [02:12] to maintain the heel position if i stop [02:14] walking the dog has to stop in order to [02:17] maintain the heel position so if my dog [02:19] leaves it then i reinforce it the exact [02:21] same way i reinforce everything else i [02:23] start with wrong and then when the dog [02:25] knows it then it turns into a no [02:28] good boy [02:29] so now when we're teaching the loose [02:30] leash walking this is the process you're [02:32] going to want to follow and i'm going to [02:33] show you of course first but just like [02:34] you said you have them next to you and [02:36] then heal [02:37] and then we step we have to make sure we [02:39] say heal first if we pair our physical [02:41] with our verbal that's known as [02:43] overshadowing whatever is more relevant [02:45] to the dog is what they're going to [02:46] focus on and they're going to ignore the [02:48] other element yeah so if i always do [02:50] this [02:51] down [02:52] he lays down but he's laying down [02:54] because i was pointing and i was luring [02:55] with the food not because i sit down [02:57] it's not predictable [02:59] if we pair our physical with our verbal [03:00] physical overrides the verbal so if i [03:02] have him next to me and i always go heal [03:05] and he steps when i step what ends up [03:07] happening is he learns to step when we [03:09] step [03:10] not when we say heal if we want him to [03:12] know that he steps when we say heal like [03:14] heal off we go just reinforcing the [03:16] command and position he's already in [03:18] so we're saying all right it's about to [03:20] go from a stationary heel state to a [03:22] mobile heel stay you ready heal off we [03:24] go [03:25] but again if we do it at the same time [03:27] then we're just teaching them to step [03:28] and we step and the reason why that's a [03:30] problem is let's say you have him [03:31] sitting next to you and you just step [03:33] away but you wanted him in a sit stay [03:35] and he breaks the position and then you [03:37] correct him that would be an unfair [03:39] correction because he goes wait the deal [03:41] is we always step at the same time [03:43] that's how it works [03:45] and unknowingly you've taught him that [03:48] thinking you were teaching him to step [03:49] when you say heal because you did the [03:50] same time so you have to go heal [03:52] then step if you stop he should just sit [03:55] automatically so that's called an [03:57] automatic sit when halted so the way [03:59] that i do it is i will say heal to get [04:00] the dog into the heel position then [04:03] before i step i will say heal and then [04:05] i'll step but then if i stop i just stop [04:07] and the dog sits and that's very easy to [04:10] teach there's three ways really to do [04:12] that one is once you come to a stop tell [04:14] your dog to sit [04:16] every single time and he will learn [04:18] every time you stop you tell me to sit [04:20] so i'm just going to sit because then [04:22] one day you stop and he goes i got it [04:24] and he just does it so that's one [04:25] another option is every time you stop [04:27] lure him with a piece of food [04:29] or use the leash every time you stop so [04:32] you're just showing him every time we [04:33] stop you have to sit that's your [04:35] responsibility and after enough [04:37] repetitions once you stop boom he'll go [04:39] to sit so teaching automatic sit when [04:41] halted is very easy so now when we're [04:44] walking when we say heal and then we [04:46] step if he's walking next to us in the [04:48] very beginning we provide verbal praise [04:51] the whole time he's next to us and he's [04:52] walking nicely so if he's walking nicely [04:55] wrong [04:57] if he's walking nicely next to you so [05:00] let's say we're walking i'm gonna go [05:02] good boy nice job way to go excellent [05:05] and once he starts to go ahead of me i [05:07] stop providing praise [05:08] and then once he's far enough ahead [05:10] right before the leash gets tight then i [05:12] say wrong i apply the leash pressure i [05:14] bring him back once he's back in [05:16] position good boy and i'm praising him [05:17] again so you want to see how it's done [05:19] yes sure all right let's bring him [05:20] outside so uh [05:22] since it's still the early stages with [05:24] the stay then you can release them when [05:26] you're close enough to touch them [05:27] remember that so you can go break good [05:29] boy you could just use a release word [05:31] you could use a terminal marker or you [05:33] could give them a new command so we'll [05:35] get geared up and we'll take them [05:36] outside before i start i like to place [05:38] the dog into the heel position and [05:40] remember it's healed then step so what i [05:41] want you to pay attention to is that i [05:43] say the command before i step when he's [05:45] next to me i'm providing verbal praise i [05:47] want him to know he's doing a good job [05:48] the moment he leaves that heel position [05:50] i stop praising right before the leash [05:53] gets tight i say wrong then i apply the [05:55] leech pressure bringing them right back [05:56] into the heel position immediately the [05:59] leash goes loose and we go right back [06:00] into the walk so i don't have to bring [06:02] them back and make them sit i just go [06:04] right back into the walk all right here [06:05] we go are you ready buddy heal then we [06:07] step [06:08] and if he doesn't step right away i just [06:10] keep going i don't worry about it once i [06:11] say heal i'm going so he's doing a great [06:13] job let me praise him good boy nice job [06:16] lots of encouragement in the beginning [06:18] he's starting to go ahead a little bit [06:20] wrong good boy and he turned around [06:22] actually right when i said wrong so my [06:24] timing wasn't as good as i would like it [06:25] to be but that's okay it's not always [06:27] going to be perfect and then when he's [06:28] doing it well good boy [06:30] nice job excellent [06:33] very good [06:35] good so he's pretty good he's really [06:38] aware when i start to slow down wrong [06:42] good job once he turns around i provide [06:44] encouragement let him know he's doing a [06:46] good job because what do we want him to [06:47] do when we say wrong we want him to turn [06:49] around and that's what he's doing good [06:51] boy [06:52] very nice i mean he's super easy so he's [06:55] going a little bit behind me and if that [06:57] happens and i want to bring him up i do [06:59] the same thing i say wrong and i bring [07:00] him up and then i loosen the leash sit [07:04] what people often do when the dog starts [07:06] to lag is they'll slow down and wait for [07:08] the dog [07:09] if the dog slacks or lags a lot then [07:12] i'll actually run forward [07:14] so i'm showing them hey you need to keep [07:15] up if you're too far behind me i might [07:17] take off [07:19] another thing that's nice when we're [07:20] doing the walks especially because he's [07:21] starting to do really well with this is [07:24] giving him additional command so i can [07:25] tell him right now down [07:28] and i was going to use the leash if i [07:29] needed to good boy i can do a come one [07:32] called [07:34] down [07:36] and i just said down again there because [07:37] i missed it i didn't say it within the [07:39] first second [07:40] come [07:42] good boy very nice come on buddy i can [07:44] use my hand to guide him if i need to [07:46] very good and then he'll and then we [07:49] turn right back into the walk come on [07:50] buddy [07:51] very good nice job excellent now what i [07:54] like to do before i stop [07:56] because eventually we want him to be [07:58] able to stop and sit when we stop [08:00] automatic the automatics that when [08:02] halted [08:03] the stopping becomes the command our [08:05] physical cue becomes the command and [08:07] what i like to do before i stop is i'll [08:09] take three paces slower than i was [08:12] before so i'll slow down for three slow [08:15] paces and then i stop and i allow the [08:17] dog to sit so it makes it easier once [08:19] you change pace [08:20] they recognize it and they get ready to [08:22] sit yeah they pick up on it very quickly [08:24] so i allow him to go ahead of me wrong [08:26] then i got him good boy very nice [08:30] and that's not usually that's not going [08:32] to get you a fully reliably trained dog [08:34] because wrong we're just using negative [08:36] reinforcement it's it's not a correction [08:39] we're just saying no i want you back [08:40] here but then eventually again it'll [08:43] turn into a correction so then [08:44] eventually it'll be no [08:46] correction [08:47] heal and then we bring them back come on [08:48] buddy good boy [08:50] you're a sensitive little guy [08:52] all right you want to give it a go [08:59] and then step nice and then if he's [09:01] doing it nicely good boy so he's going [09:02] ahead so you see how he starts with you [09:05] he's like okay i can walk ahead [09:07] and that's because you've done his [09:08] homework so he's waiting for you to do [09:10] his homework [09:12] heal and then step [09:14] and so you're watching them the whole [09:16] time now slowly [09:17] now wrong [09:18] and then bring them back [09:20] swing them around into the position and [09:22] then loose leash excellent [09:25] you paired it [09:27] oh shoot [09:37] a little late on the wrong there [09:41] well remember when you bring them back [09:43] you don't have to put them into a sit [09:44] you just go right back into the walk [09:46] remember like when when he breaks the [09:48] down stay you don't say wrong put them [09:50] back in the down down you just say wrong [09:52] and you put them back [09:56] and then you just go walk right back [09:58] into it good good boy nice job and then [10:00] let him know good job [10:02] and he starts creeping ahead again [10:04] wrong [10:05] then pressure so that right there you [10:07] said wrong and he turned around before [10:09] you applied the pressure so he's ready [10:11] for a correction if you want [10:13] and that helps with the reliability so [10:15] now the next time right before the leash [10:17] gets tight no [10:18] little leash pop after the leash pop [10:20] heal then bring him back now that time [10:22] you will have to say heal because wrong [10:24] means i'm gonna use the leash and i'm [10:26] gonna show you what i want no means a [10:27] correction once the correction is done [10:28] the nose done then we recommand heal and [10:31] help him out so no correction heal and [10:34] then assist [10:43] what's up [10:46] and it doesn't have to be a stern no [10:48] it's just no [10:50] remember our words have power based on [10:53] what they predict not how we say so you [10:56] could go [10:57] no [10:58] and if that always precedes a correction [11:00] then you say no and the dog goes all [11:02] right i won't do it again don't just [11:03] allow a dog to stop and go to the [11:05] bathroom whenever they want or wherever [11:06] they want i'll stop and tell them to go [11:08] okay so now is his opportunity he's not [11:11] going heel now we go back into the walk [11:14] so i'm going to guide him back around [11:15] good boy [11:16] and very loose on the leash once he's [11:19] next to me good boy verbal praise lots [11:20] of praise in the beginning way to go [11:22] buddy [11:23] and he leaves it so quiet [11:25] wrong [11:26] you see how he's starting to recognize [11:28] that the praise goes away when he leaves [11:30] the position good boy very nice [11:33] what a lot of people do sit [11:35] is they start getting annoyed with their [11:37] dog right because their dog's not doing [11:39] what they want [11:40] and they start to get frustrated so then [11:43] when they get the dog back they're [11:44] reprimanding the dog because he wasn't [11:46] doing what they want and now the dog [11:48] goes why do i want to stand next to you [11:49] when you're always a disgruntled jerk [11:51] yeah i wanted him to know how awesome he [11:53] is and how much i appreciate him being [11:55] next to me okay so then he wants to be [11:57] next to me so that's why in the [11:58] beginning when i'm first teaching this [12:00] when the dog is walking next to me [12:01] nicely lots of praise lots of verbal [12:03] praise the moment he leaves i go quiet [12:06] and then right before it gets tight [12:08] wrong so wrong predicts the pressure [12:11] what people always end up doing is it [12:12] gets tight and then they say wrong yeah [12:14] so you have to be good at that often [12:15] what i'll do is i'll even extend my arm [12:17] to make sure that the leash doesn't get [12:18] tight until after i say wrong and then i [12:21] can apply even if i need to pick up my [12:23] pace a little bit it should be pretty [12:25] easy to prevent the leash from getting [12:26] tight until after we say wrong so that [12:28] was a good session for him nice and [12:29] short because it is a little warm [12:31] outside right now but the key takeaway [12:33] is before you step [12:35] you want to say heal okay if he's in the [12:37] position you like lots of praise in the [12:39] beginning so he knows [12:41] when he leaves that position [12:43] no more praise and then before the leash [12:46] gets tight wrong and then apply pressure [12:48] as you walk back now if he's not in the [12:51] position you like but he's kind of [12:53] walking at your speed then you slowly [12:55] sneak out of the heel position okay and [12:57] then say wrong and apply the pressure so [12:59] that makes him more aware of your [13:01] positioning because he's like if i'm not [13:03] paying attention to you all of a sudden [13:04] you're way behind me and you're saying [13:06] wrong and i have to go back there [13:07] anyways so you find the dog doing this [13:10] checking in on you and that's what we [13:12] want so your homework is going to be [13:13] continue working on the leash pressure [13:15] make sure he really knows that he needs [13:17] to follow it we're using that continual [13:19] reinforcement to build the food drive if [13:21] he doesn't want to work he doesn't eat [13:23] once he starts doing certain commands on [13:26] the verbal alone then you want to start [13:27] spacing out the rewards each command is [13:30] its own separate element he has to learn [13:32] each one meaning if he goes into the [13:34] down position on the verbal command [13:36] alone it doesn't mean every single [13:38] command you're now spacing rewards [13:40] because he still could be learning the [13:42] heal command so whatever he's still in [13:44] the process of learning continue [13:46] reinforcement okay once he starts doing [13:48] it on the verbal command alone that's [13:50] when you go to stage two where you [13:51] either mark in reward as you have been [13:54] or you provide verbal praise so he knows [13:56] he's doing it correctly we can't go from [13:58] rewarding every behavior to all of a [13:59] sudden silence right that throws our [14:01] dogs off then you do that for a couple [14:03] weeks [14:04] after that you go to stage three which [14:06] is either mark and reward verbal praise [14:09] or you say nothing at all and then you [14:11] slowly fade out the first two but [14:12] remember we want him to always think [14:14] that we have treats so you want to do [14:16] that proactive training during the day [14:18] meaning anytime he does something that [14:20] you like [14:21] mark the behavior and then get him a [14:23] treat so if he lays down you're like i [14:25] like when you lay down there free and [14:27] then you grab him a treat he goes to his [14:29] bed free you grab him a treat he looks [14:31] at you free you get him a tree so he [14:33] starts to learn his behavior makes [14:34] rewards magically appear okay work more [14:37] on getting him into that heel position [14:39] if you need to use a barrier of some [14:41] some kind that's great it helps the dog [14:43] find it as well as just having him sit [14:46] next to you and work on him seeing that [14:48] picture that's a nice easy exercise he [14:50] just has to sit there and look at you [14:52] and you pay him and he starts to [14:53] understand when i'm in this position and [14:55] this is how i see you then i'm going to [14:57] be paid and so he'll seek out that [14:59] position okay you see it quite a lot [15:02] when we first start teaching a dog the [15:03] heel position if they've learned the sit [15:05] front so dogs that spent a lot of time [15:08] in the sit front position the moment we [15:10] try to get them into the heel what do [15:11] you think they end up doing they start [15:13] to spin around because they're used to [15:15] that picture so we're just doing the [15:16] same thing on the side okay i think this [15:17] was a good session yeah he looks plenty [15:19] tired yes and then we got to get to our [15:21] next spot so he's gonna eat his [15:23] breakfast now yeah if he's i mean if [15:26] there's room you got room for food you [15:28] good boy [15:29] he's a very handsome

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 461/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] last week working with giuseppe we [00:02] focused on the engagement work with [00:04] storm we wanted to make sure we can [00:05] communicate with him clearly and [00:07] effectively and now today we're going to [00:09] be incorporating the commands as well as [00:11] possibly teaching the stay and [00:14] introducing loose leash walking it [00:16] really is going to depend on how much [00:17] time we have so the first thing i'm [00:19] going to do is i'm just going to lure [00:20] him onto the platform once he's on the [00:22] platform [00:23] yes i could say free during the stage [00:26] just like last week we don't have to use [00:29] the terminal marker we can use either or [00:31] because we only have to worry about that [00:32] when we introduce the command because if [00:34] i lure him off the platform there's no [00:37] stay same if i lure him back on it's [00:40] also good when we're training our dogs [00:41] to not only break it down into the [00:43] smallest pieces which helps them learn [00:45] more effectively but it also helps us as [00:48] the handlers especially when we're first [00:50] learning if i know that all i need to [00:52] worry about is guide him off the [00:54] platform yes [00:55] and say yes the moment he's off the [00:57] platform that's my only responsibility [01:00] it makes it much easier [01:05] yes okay so you notice you had him go on [01:08] the platform then you had him laid down [01:11] then you marked yeah so in that [01:12] situation were you rewarding him for [01:14] going on the platform or were you [01:16] rewarding him for laying down okay i see [01:19] right yeah so when we're focusing on a [01:21] specific task we want to mark we want to [01:23] pinpoint the moment in time the dog [01:25] completes the task that we're focusing [01:27] on and so on this one we're focusing on [01:30] him coming off the platform and we're [01:32] focusing on getting him on the platform [01:35] so once he does it that's when we reward [01:37] and i just handed him the food since i [01:38] was talking to you but ideally marking [01:40] and rewarding so let's give it another [01:42] shot [01:44] yes nice much better and now let's do [01:46] the same thing going back on so once all [01:48] four paws are on the platform you're [01:51] gonna mark and reward [01:55] this [01:55] excellent much better [01:57] so very simple because we've already [01:59] established how to or we've already [02:01] taught him how to follow allure so [02:03] adding something new like this becomes [02:06] very easy since we're incorporating [02:08] something he already knows and that's [02:09] why those first three steps are so impor [02:12] important teaching the markers that [02:14] engagement training teaching the luring [02:17] and which we're going to do right now [02:19] teach him the leash pressure now [02:21] remember leash pressure is negative [02:23] reinforcement we turn pressure on when [02:25] he complies we turn it off when we're [02:28] teaching a dog leash pressure what we're [02:30] doing is we're essentially presenting a [02:32] problem to the dog we're making the [02:34] leash slightly tight and we're telling [02:36] the dog this is not going to go off [02:38] until you provide the correct solution [02:40] to the problem and that's following the [02:43] pressure so if i pull the leash directly [02:45] in front of him he needs to walk forward [02:47] if i lift up he needs to sit if i pull [02:49] down he needs to lay down [02:51] well i can't tell him that i can't say [02:53] hey when i pull forward on the leash [02:55] you're gonna have to walk forward you [02:56] got it okay let's do this we have to [02:58] show them the best way that we can so [03:00] think of the leash pressure as a problem [03:02] and then think of the lure [03:05] as the solution to the problem so i'm [03:08] going to present the problem then i'm [03:09] going to give him the solution so i'm [03:11] not going to let him become stressed out [03:14] because i'm waiting for him to figure [03:16] out the problem on his own i'm just [03:17] going to give him the answer so the way [03:19] that we do that and in addition when [03:21] we're doing leash pressure work [03:23] we're not pulling very hard so i'm [03:25] pulling very very lightly and i'm [03:28] staying consistent so one thing i'm not [03:30] doing which a lot of people tend to do [03:32] is they start to increase how hard [03:33] they're pulling or they'll do this [03:36] they'll pull a little bit and loosen and [03:38] pull a little bit it's a consistent [03:39] pressure okay [03:41] and then i keep my reward hand behind my [03:44] back when i start because i want to [03:46] start the pressure first so he learns to [03:49] turn off the pressure if i do it at the [03:50] exact same time [03:52] he's not learning the pressure just like [03:54] everything else so what i have to do is [03:57] i have to start to pull yes well he [03:59] followed it so that was very easy [04:01] go to lift up so there's the pressure [04:03] now here's the solution now i turn off [04:06] the pressure and i provide him the [04:07] reward same thing when i'm doing the [04:10] down i start to pull down there's the [04:13] pressure now i provide the solution i [04:16] release the pressure and i give him the [04:18] reward so same thing when i bring it up [04:20] nice and slow there's the pressure [04:23] here's the solution [04:26] i turn off the pressure i give them the [04:28] reward and i do this for all kinds of [04:30] different positions because we can use [04:32] the leash pressure to reinforce [04:35] expectations we use it to help teach the [04:37] stay we use it to help teach loose leash [04:40] walking we use it to help show the dog [04:42] certain behaviors we would like him or [04:44] we would not like him to perform such as [04:46] going into a certain room perhaps [04:48] jumping up on people jumping up on [04:50] furniture running out into the street we [04:52] can use the leash pressure to teach him [04:54] not to do these behaviors and when we do [04:57] it correctly you see he's not stressed [04:58] out he's not worried because i'm showing [05:01] him what he needs to do when a dog knows [05:04] what they're supposed to do in any given [05:05] situation their confidence goes up and [05:08] contrary to popular belief we don't want [05:10] a submissive dog we want a confident dog [05:13] same thing with being a handler yeah [05:15] you're not going to be confident unless [05:17] you know what to do once you know what [05:18] to do the confidence comes [05:20] naturally [05:21] and now release the pressure because he [05:23] followed it [05:26] oh yeah once he starts following it we [05:28] don't want there to be any pressure so [05:29] like often when we start pulling in [05:31] front of the dog people want him to feel [05:33] the pressure but if he's falling like [05:35] this notice there's no pressure that's [05:37] good he's doing it right i don't have to [05:38] add pressure if he's following it very [05:40] good buddy [05:42] but the lifting up oh and then he sat so [05:44] then i turn it off really quickly so the [05:46] way you handle the leash is very much [05:48] determined on how the dog responds to it [05:51] beautiful non-marking reward very nice [05:53] same thing try the sit so lift up [05:55] slightly lift up slightly [05:59] and then lure him with the food [06:01] lift up now turn up the pressure and [06:03] reward [06:05] good now turn off the pressure you can [06:06] see how there's a little bit of tension [06:07] so you want the leash to be as loose as [06:09] possible and there's another reason why [06:11] i use these very thin light leashes [06:15] because the less the dog can feel the [06:16] leash the better it is for leash [06:18] pressure work in addition to getting the [06:20] dog to that off leash status because if [06:23] the dog feels a leash all the time [06:24] they're more aware of it if they only [06:26] feel it when we're trying to communicate [06:27] something to them then it becomes a very [06:29] useful tool [06:31] okay [06:35] good [06:36] and let's try the down the down is [06:37] always difficult for people so you're [06:38] going to have to close grab closer to [06:41] the collar on the leash so you're going [06:43] to be very close up here see how i'm [06:45] like basically grabbing the clip at this [06:46] point yeah there's the pressure here's [06:49] the lure i release and then i reward [06:51] which i didn't even have a piece of food [06:52] in my hand [06:54] no people don't really fully understand [06:56] leash pressure until they see it and [06:58] once they see how it's properly taught [07:00] and implemented it becomes such a [07:03] powerful tool in communicating with our [07:04] dogs because that's that's what dog [07:06] training is [07:07] being able to communicate with our dogs [07:08] in a timely manner when they're right [07:10] and wrong and giving them a clear path [07:11] to success that's something one of my [07:13] favorite dog trainers michael ellis says [07:15] and it's spot-on accurate if we can [07:17] communicate with our dogs [07:19] we can train them and that's really what [07:21] this is it's being able to add one more [07:23] tool to that communication [07:27] so let's bring them back up into a sit [07:29] so apply the pressure first not the food [07:31] keep it consistent now lure with the [07:33] food [07:34] lift no no don't just hand it to him you [07:35] lure him to get him to sit so we bring [07:38] it up come on buddy then turn off the [07:39] pressure and then reward [07:42] again the pressure is the problem so i'm [07:44] going here's [07:47] i'm saying here's a problem buddy [07:50] this is not going to go away until you [07:51] lay down [07:53] so you better lay down and he doesn't [07:55] know what i'm saying so up and he does [07:57] it [07:59] so that's great i turned off the [08:00] pressure and rewarded him but since it's [08:02] not a lot of pressure you don't see a [08:04] lot of resistance or stress [08:06] it's a physical cue that's all it is so [08:08] again i lift up there's the problem now [08:10] i'm just going to give him the solution [08:12] come on buddy come on big guy i could [08:15] even stand up be like come on you can do [08:17] it but i'm not going to turn it off [08:19] until he complies over here there it is [08:20] right in your face [08:22] come on buddy and a lot of times people [08:24] would give up right here they go oh well [08:26] he's not he's not doing it so he's [08:28] distracted so he still has to sit now he [08:30] sits and now i turn up the pressure so [08:32] even if you don't get the instant [08:34] response that you want you have to make [08:36] sure you continue to follow through [08:38] because the two rules to leash pressure [08:40] is one once the pressure's turned on it [08:42] cannot be turned off until they comply [08:44] number two the moment they comply [08:46] we have to instantly shut it off [08:48] and the more aware you are of the leash [08:52] pressure as the handler the more aware [08:55] of the pressure the dog will be and what [08:56] i mean is what people tend to do all the [08:58] time is the leash will get tight loose [09:00] tight they're not paying attention [09:02] they're doing this and they're getting [09:04] all kinds of random tension on and off [09:06] and so what happens the dog completely [09:08] ignores the pressure because it's [09:10] meaningless to them but the moment it [09:12] actually is directed towards them any [09:15] time you apply the slightest bit of [09:16] pressure he's going to go what's up what [09:17] do you want what do you need [09:19] and then you can communicate so let's [09:20] try one more time and then we're going [09:21] to move on to the next step [09:23] you want oh go down yeah try the down [09:27] beautiful now release the pressure [09:28] because he did it oh yeah yeah so if he [09:30] does it before you even help with the [09:32] food that's what we want that's the goal [09:34] the goal is that i'll start to lift up [09:36] and boom he sits before he even feels [09:38] the pressure but it's a process to get [09:40] to that point and that's what we're [09:42] working on right now so that is showing [09:44] us that he's already starting to learn [09:45] it [09:52] so keep yep keep it and talk to him if [09:54] you need to whatever you need to do to [09:55] get him to stand up you could be like [09:56] come on buddy let's go there we go keep [09:59] it keep it going lift up above his head [10:00] with the food and once he sits turn it [10:03] off [10:05] lift it up above his nose there we go so [10:07] that'll turn it off yeah [10:09] perfect [10:11] yeah if you have it [10:13] directly in front of his come on buddy [10:15] if you have it right here that's not [10:16] going to kill him to sit it's the act of [10:18] lifting up that cues them to sit so [10:20] here's the pressure come on buddy [10:23] turn it off very good very good [10:26] and then we can do the [10:28] foot technique as well there's the [10:30] pressure very light and then we down [10:32] and then we release so you have to have [10:34] very good balance to be able to do that [10:37] but when you do this what ends up [10:38] happening is [10:40] when i start to do this before the leash [10:42] is even tight [10:43] he would sit oh very good buddy so he [10:45] did it really nice there and i'm gonna [10:47] reward him for that because we're still [10:48] at the stage of using continual [10:50] reinforcement reinforcing every correct [10:52] repetition and then it gets to the point [10:54] where we just lift our leg [10:56] and you won't even touch the leash and [10:57] the dog will lay down [10:59] because they've learned that pattern [11:01] again they learn through pattern [11:03] recognition they're very good at picking [11:05] up these patterns you've probably [11:07] recognized it if the first thing you do [11:08] in the morning is you feed them he's [11:10] ready to get some food if you take them [11:12] out first thing in the morning if you [11:14] walk them first thing in the morning [11:15] whatever you do they learn those [11:17] patterns and they thrive on that [11:19] giuseppe is doing great with the [11:21] physical cues his timing is looking [11:23] really nice he's gonna have to pay [11:25] attention to when he marks behaviors [11:27] although he's pretty close to doing it [11:29] the way he's supposed to these small [11:31] adjustments are going to make all the [11:32] difference and we're going to really be [11:34] focused on that timing today all right [11:36] so that's pretty good you're going to [11:38] have to practice that this it's it's [11:40] definitely a skill set but once you have [11:42] it down it becomes very easy and [11:45] effortless and it makes everything else [11:47] significantly better so now what we're [11:49] going to work on is we're going to work [11:50] on incorporating the command [11:53] to each exercise and i want you to use [11:56] both the luring [11:57] as well as the leash pressure for each [12:00] command that we're going to do we're [12:02] going to start with sitting down because [12:03] we can go back and forth between the two [12:06] and then we'll start incorporating the [12:08] climb command heel center all those [12:10] other commands that are going to help [12:12] with his training process so first i'm [12:14] going to try with just the food lure [12:16] i'm going to say the command i'm going [12:18] to give him about a half second to [12:20] process the word [12:22] then i'm going to give him the physical [12:24] cue that will get him to do the behavior [12:27] so the command is the question i go hey [12:29] buddy do you know what to do when i say [12:31] sit [12:32] this is what you do come on [12:35] free and then i mark and reward with the [12:37] terminal marker so we don't have to [12:38] worry about reinforcing the stay and [12:40] even though i said the terminal marker [12:42] and handed it to him if he's conditioned [12:44] he knows he can get up and he received [12:46] the reward so in the beginning when [12:48] we're first teaching free we move back [12:50] and we get the dog to come and get it [12:52] because that's teaching him that free [12:53] means release and reward but once he's [12:56] conditioned we don't have to do that so [12:57] again we're gonna give the command [12:59] down [13:01] then the queue so you see that half [13:02] second pause [13:04] that gives him sorry i should have said [13:06] free but break release word gives him [13:08] that moment [13:10] to hear the word [13:12] process the sound and then start to [13:14] learn what comes after which is the [13:16] physical cue so i like to think of it as [13:18] questions and answers the question's the [13:20] command the answer is the physical cue [13:23] give the command sit now the queue [13:28] free free and then reward excellent very [13:31] good so now we're going to do the same [13:32] thing with down [13:36] say the command [13:38] down now the queue [13:40] free [13:41] and then reward [13:43] and what's great with this too is [13:45] people also like to get their dog to do [13:47] commands at a distance [13:49] because when we first teach commands [13:51] we're teaching the dog when they're [13:52] directly in front of us and that's the [13:54] picture they get used to seeing but we [13:56] also like them to perform the behaviors [13:58] even when we're not right next to them [14:00] and a good way to do that is almost how [14:01] you're doing right now you just [14:03] gradually get farther away and then you [14:05] give the command sit [14:07] and then you just follow through with [14:09] the queue the same way free [14:10] you would any other way you just have to [14:12] end up walking towards the dog to help [14:14] them out with the cue but they end up [14:16] figuring it out we don't have to run and [14:17] rush people are always worried about the [14:19] one second i got one second one second [14:20] it's like relax [14:22] you got one second to mark a behavior [14:24] when they complete it but the moment the [14:26] dog knows so like here's a common [14:28] mistake people make right the dog does [14:30] something and they go yes [14:32] right they pair [14:33] the marker with the delivery of the [14:35] reward but the dog still ends up [14:37] learning and people go well if you have [14:39] to say the marker before you deliver the [14:41] food how is the dog still learning well [14:43] the moment the dog sees the food coming [14:46] if every time i move my hand towards the [14:48] dog i give him a piece of food then this [14:51] becomes just as clear to him as a marker [14:53] but what's the difference between this [14:56] indicating he's going to get a reward or [14:58] saying yes or free indicating he's going [15:00] to get a reward well one of them he has [15:02] to see it take place the other one he [15:04] only has to hear it [15:05] so it becomes way more powerful and it [15:07] becomes more transferable you're making [15:09] all kinds of funny noises all right so [15:11] now we're going to do the same thing but [15:13] this time with the leash now we would go [15:15] down [15:17] then follow through with the q there's [15:18] the pressure [15:20] here's the lure release the pressure [15:22] deliver the food lure [15:24] good very nice nice little massage while [15:27] he's eating [15:28] now we're gonna go right back up [15:30] sit i could even stand up which often [15:32] helps there's the pressure now the q [15:35] release the pressure free and reward i [15:38] was a little late on the free button [15:41] let's do i'm going to do it without [15:42] talking this time so i can pinpoint the [15:43] correct time [15:44] down [15:47] free very good buddy nice [15:52] sit [15:54] free [15:55] so you see now he's starting to respond [15:57] to just the leash without that extra [15:59] help he's significantly smarter than [16:01] most frenchies i've worked with [16:04] all right so we're gonna give another [16:05] command [16:06] down [16:08] free very good [16:12] excellent he's learning quite rapidly [16:14] right now this is excellent [16:15] sit [16:17] free so you see how he got up again that [16:19] time before feeling any pressure that's [16:21] what we want go ahead sir [16:26] that's fine you can do it on the climb [16:28] bed [16:29] so give the command and then start to [16:31] cue them with the leash [16:33] so [16:34] sit [16:35] free he did it he did it so mark in [16:37] reward you asked him to sit and he sat [16:39] that's perfect watch the pressure on the [16:40] leash [16:42] good nice and loose all right so go [16:43] ahead let's do another sit [16:46] sit now slowly start to lift up walk now [16:48] turn it off and reward excellent so he's [16:51] starting to respond very nicely to the [16:53] leash let's do another down [16:56] do it with the leash [16:58] so just like i did when i said the [17:00] command i just reached down and grabbed [17:01] this part of the leash okay so you don't [17:03] have you can't really pull down from [17:05] there so you come down to his level yeah [17:07] exactly okay [17:10] down now [17:11] move forward help him with the leash [17:14] and free and turn off the pressure today [17:16] was a great session i'm happy with [17:18] storm's progress he started to get a [17:20] little tired at the end so unfortunately [17:22] we did not work on that loose leash [17:24] walking but we did increase the [17:26] communication by adding the physical cue [17:29] with the leash pressure as well as [17:30] introducing commands so i'm excited to [17:33] see the progress that they make and what [17:35] we're going to be focused on in our next [17:37] session so for giuseppe's homework i [17:40] want him to work on continuing to lure [17:42] and add that leash pressure i want the [17:44] leash pressure to be very very clear to [17:47] the dog to where storm is following it [17:49] without actually having to feel the [17:50] pressure and i also want him to work [17:53] with his mom and to teach her the skills [17:55] that he's been working on so the dog is [17:58] getting very consistent training [18:00] throughout the entire household [18:06] yeah that's fine here eat some more [18:07] buddy [18:08] right here [18:14] let's go ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2022-09-06_Ivan_Pavlov_s_Classical_Conditioning.

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 466/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we are in riverside california at [00:03] ph dogs with professional dog trainer [00:05] bethany perdome and we're going to be [00:07] working on some common training [00:09] techniques and goals we are going to [00:11] work on the place command the place [00:13] command means go to your bed and stay [00:15] you can call whatever you want dogs [00:16] don't speak english just pick a word and [00:18] stick with it so today we're going to [00:19] use place so our command and our hand [00:22] signal for play so we're going to step [00:23] and we're going to point and we're going [00:24] to say place so the first thing we need [00:25] to do is get the behavior so i'm going [00:27] to use a treat lure i'm going to put it [00:29] to her nose i'm gonna guide her on there [00:30] when all four paws are on there i'm [00:32] gonna mark it with a yes and i'm gonna [00:33] give her a treat and then break and she [00:35] gets off if you have separate words for [00:37] your markers and release words it's not [00:39] a big deal again they don't speak [00:40] english as long as you're being [00:41] consistent that's what's important so [00:42] i'm going to say i'm going to get her to [00:44] do it again so just lure her on there [00:46] all four feet are on there yes reward [00:48] free or break whatever your word is [00:51] now that i'm pretty sure i can get the [00:53] behavior i'm going to start to add the [00:54] word so i'm going to say the word first [00:56] i'm going to lure her on there when [00:57] she's on there and mark it and then i'm [00:58] going to break her so i'm not working on [01:00] duration right now i'm just working on [01:02] getting the behavior so i'm going to say [01:04] place so we're on here yes [01:07] break [01:09] place [01:10] yes break [01:13] so now what i'm doing instead of luring [01:15] her the whole way with the food in my [01:16] hand like this [01:17] now i'm going to put the treat in these [01:19] three fingers i'm going to close it like [01:20] this so now i've got my food lower in my [01:23] hand but i'm changing it to my hand [01:24] signal so now i've got my food in my [01:26] three fingers close it i've got my [01:28] pointer so i'm going to say place [01:30] she gets on there yes reward i'm going [01:32] to reload [01:33] put one treat in those three fingers [01:34] close it break [01:36] place [01:37] yes [01:39] break [01:40] place [01:42] yes [01:43] break [01:44] now when i know i'm ready to go the next [01:46] step is when the dog starts to offer [01:47] going on the bed they understand that [01:48] this is a good place so just like that i [01:51] would say yes but as soon as those four [01:52] feet on there break she gets to come off [01:54] so once my dog is offering the behavior [01:57] now that i know that i put enough value [01:59] into that behavior that i can start [02:00] working on duration distractions and all [02:02] those other things yes [02:04] break [02:06] place yes [02:09] break so now i'm going to start adding [02:10] some distance between me and the place [02:12] so at first i was right up on the place [02:14] and now i'm going to start slowly [02:15] walking away from the place so again to [02:17] start i'd be really close place [02:20] yes [02:21] break i just take a little step get her [02:23] out of the way place [02:26] yes [02:28] break a little step [02:30] place [02:32] if she gets stuck again she's already [02:34] offered it so i let her work through it [02:36] break and i'm not going to add any more [02:38] distance i'm going to work there place [02:40] let her think [02:42] she's offering some other behaviors [02:43] that's not going to get her paid i keep [02:45] my hand signal like that [02:47] yes as long as she's thinking i'm going [02:50] to let her problem solve break [02:52] place [02:54] yes [02:55] break [02:57] that step again place [03:00] yes [03:01] so even though she didn't get all the [03:02] way on there that's fine i marked her [03:03] for making that break [03:07] place [03:09] so didn't mark her there not going to [03:11] reward that [03:13] yes [03:15] break [03:17] place [03:19] yes [03:21] so i marked it when all four feet are on [03:23] there and then she kind of came off to [03:24] get the treat so i still want to reward [03:26] her for all four on there so what i did [03:28] i just used the food to kind of push her [03:29] back on and i rewarded her when all four [03:31] feet are on there break [03:34] a little more distance [03:35] place [03:37] yes [03:39] break [03:41] place [03:43] yes [03:45] good girl and then i'm gonna add on a [03:46] good note so i don't want to just keep [03:47] drilling this until she's bored and [03:48] isn't hungry anymore so i got a couple [03:50] good ones i'm gonna go ahead and and [03:52] call that a lesson good girly so now [03:54] that i've built some motivation into the [03:56] place command now we're gonna start [03:57] adding our stay some people teach an [04:00] implied stay which means if i tell you [04:02] sit you're going to sit and hold that [04:03] position until i give you another [04:04] command i use the word stay just [04:06] basically to give the dog a little bit [04:08] of extra information they're going to be [04:09] there for a while [04:10] so [04:11] i already have a dog that's motivated [04:13] for the food i've got my place right [04:14] here i do have my dog on a leash um so [04:16] that way if they do make a mistake i can [04:18] stop them from accessing any [04:19] distractions or any other rewards so [04:22] even though i didn't ask her i'm still [04:23] going to tell her break and kind of [04:24] guide her off so the first thing i'm [04:26] going to do i'm going to do my i'm [04:26] handstand to set her to the place place [04:28] she goes on there yes i'm going to [04:30] reward her [04:34] break she gets to come off [04:35] now i'm going to use my good as i keep [04:37] going so now i'm going to send her place [04:40] good [04:46] good [04:48] she's very awkward so she offers it down [04:49] i'm going to go ahead and reward her if [04:50] she offers a sit i'm going to go ahead [04:52] and order so any kind of calm behaviors [04:54] i'm going to reward for being on her [04:55] place [04:57] good [05:02] good [05:04] i'm going to release her break and she [05:05] gets to come off [05:07] so again i just was rewarding calm [05:09] behavior so again you can see she's [05:10] motivated for a place that's what i'm [05:11] looking for break [05:13] so now she's at the point where if she [05:14] offers it before i tell her i'm not [05:16] going to reward her for it i want to get [05:17] it on cue [05:19] place [05:21] good [05:23] get my treats ready to go that way i can [05:24] do rapid fire again i'm going to wait [05:26] for a calm behavior [05:28] good [05:30] good [05:31] and i'm trying to feed her low in [05:33] position so if i give her the treat high [05:35] she's more likely to jump up for it i [05:37] don't want to reward up so [05:39] i'm going to reward her for that down in [05:41] that down position so fast and low [05:45] good fast and low [05:48] good fast and low [05:50] and i'm going to break her before she [05:52] makes a mistake break [05:54] if my dog gets stuck i can just use my [05:55] leash to help them off [05:56] place [05:58] good [06:03] good [06:06] good [06:10] break [06:12] so this is where i'm working on duration [06:13] you notice i'm right up next the dog i'm [06:15] not walking away i'm not adding any [06:17] distractions i'm just adding some [06:19] duration so at first i'm rewarding those [06:21] calm behaviors and now i'm going to [06:23] start asking for more time between the [06:24] treats so i'm going to reward her every [06:26] five seconds for 15 seconds for example [06:28] so i'm going to center place [06:31] good one treat for going on there [06:35] one treat for the down good [06:38] and now i'm gonna wait [06:41] so even if she's in the down i'm gonna [06:42] wait five seconds so one two [06:44] three [06:45] four five good [06:49] one [06:50] two three four five good [06:55] one two three four five good [07:00] break and she gets come off if you [07:03] notice i'm not rewarding her for the [07:05] release they already want to get off so [07:07] i'm going to add all my reinforcement [07:09] for the stay if i have a dog that [07:11] constantly gets stuck in this day and [07:13] i'm having to use a leash to get them [07:14] off then i'll reward for the break but i [07:16] generally reward just for the stay they [07:18] already want to be off so i want to make [07:20] that more reinforcing place [07:27] good so now when she goes on her place [07:29] i'm waiting for her to do the down so [07:30] now places go to your bed and down [07:33] so she gets up no reward [07:36] good reward now i'm going to do every 10 [07:39] seconds for 20 seconds so i'm adding [07:41] more time between the treats [07:47] good [07:48] one two three four five six seven eight [07:54] nine ten good [07:58] she gets up i don't care [08:05] good one two [08:07] three four five six seven eight nine ten [08:13] reward break [08:16] so i'll start to work on this again you [08:19] can see how much motivation i've put in [08:20] that place that's what i'm looking [08:21] that's what i'm looking for [08:22] so again if i didn't tell her to go i'm [08:24] not gonna reward her i'm also not gonna [08:26] correct her if she gets off [08:27] if i want to i can step on my leash and [08:29] that way she doesn't go over there and [08:30] just keep getting on and not getting [08:31] reinforced [08:32] so my goal for duration is to build up [08:35] to one minute for one treat so initially [08:38] i'm rewarding every five seconds for 15 [08:41] seconds then every 10 seconds for 20 [08:42] seconds then maybe every 10 seconds for [08:45] 30 seconds and then [08:47] uh maybe every 15 seconds for 30 seconds [08:49] and then every [08:51] for 30 seconds reward every 15 seconds [08:53] and then every 15 seconds for a minute [08:55] again i'm just slowly starting to add [08:57] more time that the dog is staying on [08:59] there once i can tell them to go and i'm [09:01] getting one minute for just one treat [09:02] and then breaking now i can start [09:04] working on my duration or i'm sorry my [09:06] distractions or my distance but i [09:08] usually work on my duration first if i [09:10] can't get my dog to sit there for a [09:11] minute i can't leave them and walk [09:13] across the yard [09:15] because it's going to take me more time [09:16] to put them back so for duration i'm [09:18] just right up next to the dog i'm just [09:19] rewarding them and just starting to add [09:21] more and more time between the treats [09:23] break no treats for getting off so after [09:25] i've done my duration i can get my dog [09:26] stay in the place for one minute for one [09:28] treat i'm gonna start working on my [09:29] distractions [09:31] the key when you're working distractions [09:32] is you have to be faster than your dog [09:34] so i'm going to send my dog to the place [09:36] and i'm going to start putting my [09:37] distractions behind me i want to be able [09:39] to stop my dog from accessing those [09:41] rewards if i tell them to stay and i [09:43] drop a treat and my dog hurries up and [09:44] grabs the treat off the ground stay [09:46] basically learns to be faster than mom [09:48] and i don't want them to learn that so [09:50] i'm going to go ahead and send her to [09:51] the place i'm going to have the leash in [09:52] my hand ready to go so place [09:55] good [09:56] pick up my leash so i want to hold it [09:58] short attention free so i want to be [10:00] able to quickly stop my dog if they get [10:02] off but i don't want to be holding them [10:04] back from [10:05] from making that mistake mistakes are [10:06] part of learning so what i'm going to do [10:08] is i'm going to drop my treat where [10:10] again i can be faster than the dog so [10:11] i'm not going to drop it off right where [10:12] they can dive bomb for it so i'm going [10:13] to drop it behind me i'm going to tell [10:15] her stay do my hand signal and then drop [10:17] my treat [10:19] she's going to stop so i just use my [10:20] leash to get her back [10:23] she stays i reward her so even if she [10:25] made a mistake [10:27] i'm going to reward her for when she's [10:28] right so again leash is short she gets [10:30] off [10:31] offered a calm behavior i'm gonna reward [10:33] her [10:36] offer to calm behavior i'm gonna reward [10:37] her i'm gonna do my distraction again [10:42] she got off put her back you can also [10:44] mark it with a no it's just hard for me [10:45] to talk and train at the same time [10:47] off to calm behavior reward her [10:51] drop my treat again [10:54] the fly distracter i'm gonna reward her [10:58] drop it again stay [11:01] good that time she stayed back on her [11:02] own i'm gonna reward her [11:05] again my leash is tension free but short [11:07] stay [11:09] good reward her [11:12] stay [11:14] nope [11:16] good [11:17] reward her [11:20] stay [11:23] good reward her for staying [11:26] stay good reward her for staying [11:30] and now i'm going to try to pick up the [11:31] treats stay [11:33] if she gets off use a leash get her back [11:37] and everything good comes to you for [11:38] staying so all of these treats come to [11:40] her for staying so i'm not going to [11:43] break her to the treats [11:44] i'm going to reward her for staying and [11:47] you can see my leash i'm ready to stop [11:48] her if she decided to get up [11:52] i can do another stay if i want stay [11:56] good she didn't go for it again [11:58] everything good comes to you for staying [11:59] stay [12:02] comes to her [12:04] comes to her and then i'm gonna release [12:06] her break [12:08] good job she can sniff for the food [12:10] there's no food on there so again she's [12:11] not going to get reinforced for coming [12:12] off everything good happens for going on [12:14] there if my dog is constantly making [12:16] mistakes with my distractions i want to [12:18] try to make them easier [12:20] you should have success so if i'm [12:22] bouncing a ball and on a scale of one to [12:24] ten the ball is like my dog's absolute [12:26] favorite i'm not going to start with a [12:27] ball i'm going to start with something [12:29] that's lower value so that way they can [12:31] be successful i want to start low and [12:33] then go high so if my dog can't stay [12:36] while i drop a kibble on the ground good [12:38] luck dropping a hamburger or a piece of [12:40] steak or bouncing a ball if that's [12:42] higher value so you want to start with [12:44] low value [12:46] distractions and then slowly build up to [12:48] higher value distractions or higher [12:49] level distractions so now that we've [12:51] worked on our duration and our [12:53] distractions now we're gonna start [12:54] working on our distance so we're gonna [12:56] send our dog to place and it's gonna [12:57] look like a little dance we're gonna [12:58] take one step back go back and reward [13:00] two steps back go back on reward and [13:02] then a break and then we're gonna do two [13:04] steps go back and reward three steps go [13:06] back in order so we're just gonna slowly [13:07] start adding more and more distance [13:08] between us and the dog so we're gonna [13:10] get her to go foster place [13:14] good [13:17] tell her to stay give her a hand signal [13:18] like a stop sign if she offers a calm [13:21] behavior i'm gonna go back and reward [13:22] her [13:24] so i'm gonna take a step back go back [13:26] and reward [13:28] two steps [13:30] go back and reward [13:33] three steps [13:35] nope she gets off use my leash put her [13:37] back [13:38] tell her to stay again [13:39] take two steps go back and reward so i'm [13:41] gonna go back and make it slightly [13:43] easier for her [13:44] take three steps [13:46] go back and reward good she was about to [13:48] offer a calm behavior stay one two three [13:54] good there she goes [13:56] now i'm gonna release her break [14:00] please [14:02] good [14:03] stay [14:04] good offered a down i'm gonna reward her [14:06] for that [14:08] stay [14:11] nope marked it with a no go back and [14:13] reward her [14:14] stay [14:16] offered a day or a sit i'm gonna go back [14:18] and reward her [14:19] stay [14:22] go back and reward her [14:29] good offer to set [14:31] go reward her [14:38] good [14:40] reward [14:41] good [14:42] break [14:44] good now i'm going to start to walk [14:45] around in a circle around her [14:47] place [14:49] good [14:50] stay [14:51] so now that i can walk to the end of my [14:53] leash [14:54] now i'm going to start to make a big [14:55] circle around and sometimes i'll just do [14:57] a couple little side steps and go back [14:58] and reward her [15:00] remind her to stay [15:02] go to the end of my leash [15:04] nope so marked it with a nail i'm going [15:06] to put her back on there good stay [15:12] good [15:13] she's very sensitive so you see just [15:15] with my nose she's like oh gosh and she [15:17] runs back on there so that's okay i [15:18] don't need to follow up with any kind of [15:20] leash corrections or anything i can just [15:21] mark it with a no and that's enough to [15:23] to [15:24] upset her enough that she doesn't want [15:26] to do it again stay [15:32] nope [15:33] good so there she fixed herself on just [15:35] my verbal no so i'm going to go ahead [15:36] and reward her for that [15:38] stay i'm not going to do that often [15:41] because i don't want my dog to learn get [15:43] off get back on get a treat [15:49] stay [15:58] good [16:00] break [16:02] all right so now that we've worked on [16:03] our duration distractions and distance [16:06] separately now we're going to put them [16:07] all together [16:08] so we're going to work on [16:10] uh distractions with me at a longer [16:12] distance for a longer period of time so [16:14] we're going to center place [16:17] good [16:19] stay [16:23] good offer to calm behavior i'm going to [16:24] reward her [16:26] stay [16:27] and now i'm farther away and add my [16:29] distraction stay [16:35] so i'm going to wait till she offers [16:36] another d-o-w-n [16:38] and then i'm going to reward her [16:41] nope [16:42] so i let her kind of decide if she was [16:43] going to make a mistake or if she was [16:45] going to offer that calm behavior again [16:48] good [16:53] stay [16:57] now this is where if your dog is doing [16:58] well you can go ahead and drop your [16:59] leash that way i can add more distance [17:10] stay [17:14] good offer to calm behavior [17:17] go in our order [17:22] good [17:27] stay [17:35] good girl [17:36] and now again everything good is going [17:37] to come to her so remind her to stay [17:40] treats come to her [17:43] if you don't want to give all of the [17:44] ones that you've dropped so there she [17:46] was right on the edge so she's either [17:48] gonna could make a mistake and i can [17:50] mark out the no or she was gonna offer [17:52] calm behavior so she offered a calm so i [17:54] rewarded her for that thank you so much [17:56] for watching i hope everybody enjoyed

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 470/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we are working with Annie and [00:01] Elfie and we're probably going to be [00:03] going on to the next step where either [00:04] we're going to incorporate more of the [00:06] stay in different locations or we're [00:08] going to be adding more of the verbal [00:10] command making sure we say the command [00:12] before the physical cue but I want to [00:14] see what they're focused on where they [00:16] are in their training and what issues [00:18] they may be struggling with our last [00:20] session we worked on luring leash [00:22] pressure some of that engagement [00:24] training as well as incorporating the [00:26] command and teaching the place stay [00:27] right yes so what is it you want to [00:30] focus on this week have you been having [00:31] any issues with the leash pressure or [00:33] the stay or jumping up something that [00:36] you want to address [00:37] um well they're doing pretty good until [00:40] they get together so once we actually [00:42] start putting them together they don't [00:44] listen anymore okay so that's so you [00:46] know um individually Alfie does great [00:49] individually she does great but I'd like [00:51] to work on uh putting like putting it [00:53] together where they both can sit or both [00:55] can stay okay excellent and this is a [00:57] common issue that a lot of people have [00:58] their dogs will listen but once they [01:01] bring the other dog out all of a sudden [01:02] it seems as if neither dog has that any [01:05] training and the reason for that is [01:07] we're adding a new motivating factor in [01:10] the environment so anytime I start [01:12] training a dog I want the least amount [01:14] of distractions possible when I'm [01:15] training a brand new dog a completely [01:17] empty room is best because I have [01:19] nothing I have to compete up against but [01:21] as the dogs start to get better we start [01:23] to add new distractions such as a toy [01:26] rolling by while they're on a stay or [01:27] another dog or something like that and [01:30] it's very common that once the family [01:33] brings the two dogs together they don't [01:35] listen so that is a training process [01:37] just as much as training each one [01:39] individually so we're going to do the [01:40] same process but we're going to work [01:42] together for this it does help to have [01:44] two people you can do it solo but it [01:47] definitely makes it easier when we have [01:48] two people doing this so what we're [01:50] going to do is I'm going to place her on [01:52] her climb you're going to place him on [01:54] his climb what will we call him those [01:56] are we calling it climb yeah okay [01:57] perfect and you can say it wherever you [01:59] are remember we're doing the implied [02:01] stay so once we tell them climb then [02:04] it's our job to make sure they go to the [02:06] climb so I'm not going to wait to see if [02:08] she's if she's going to do it or if he's [02:10] going to do it I'm going to say climb [02:11] and then I'm going to make her go to her [02:13] climb platform and you're going to do [02:14] the same thing with him then we're going [02:16] to leave them and walk away it's your [02:18] responsibility to reinforce him if he [02:21] breaks it and it's my responsibility to [02:24] reinforce her stay if she breaks it okay [02:26] okay so we're basically training the [02:28] dogs at the same time but you're [02:31] responsible for him and I'm responsible [02:33] for her and this starts to get them to [02:35] understand that the rules apply regard [02:37] regardless of how many other dogs are in [02:40] the environment with them and again you [02:42] can do this solo but starting off it's [02:43] definitely easier to have someone [02:45] helping you Annie climb and now I'm [02:48] gonna walk her over come on baby [02:49] I'm just going to take my time I don't [02:51] need to run over there I'm going to [02:52] place her on [02:54] yes use the continuation marker we were [02:56] using yes as the continuation marker yes [02:59] okay and if she breaks I'm going to say [03:01] wrong [03:02] and put her back on Good Girl drop the [03:04] leash as long as she maintains it yes [03:06] reward just like we did before okay so [03:08] now you're going to do the same thing [03:09] with him Alfie climb and then walk him [03:12] over [03:14] try not to be lifting up on the leash [03:16] the whole time as you're walking him [03:17] since that's normally a cue to sit once [03:20] he's on excellent [03:22] good now start to walk away so you're [03:24] watching him I'm watching her if he [03:27] breaks one wrong wrong and then calmly [03:30] bring him back so she's doing great [03:33] wrong [03:34] and now I'm gonna reinforce her [03:38] yes come on [03:40] this way good girl wrong [03:45] okay it almost feels as if wrong if [03:48] you're reteaching the stay [03:50] and because she's interested in what [03:52] you're doing with him good girl [03:55] sometimes if you have multiple dogs [03:58] you can use different words for each one [04:00] but that is pretty difficult the good [04:03] thing is our dogs are reasonably smart [04:06] meaning they can notice if you're [04:08] marking a Behavior coming from Alfie or [04:12] if you're marking a behavior that's [04:13] coming from Annie because you're looking [04:15] at that dog so they're able to figure [04:17] that out casually walk away [04:21] wrong wrong [04:23] [Applause] [04:26] and then loose leash very nice [04:31] bro [04:32] sorry buddy [04:35] and I like how you're taking your time [04:37] you're not repeating the word wrong we [04:39] just say it once the moment the dog [04:41] makes the mistake then we follow through [04:43] with what we want them to do [04:45] so you're doing it very nicely yes and [04:47] I'm gonna reward her for doing a great [04:50] job just hanging out see it's easy when [04:51] you just hang out there so now I'm going [04:54] to have you start taking over for both [04:55] dogs I'm gonna jump in if I need to help [04:58] but now you're watching both of them and [05:01] you can reward her as well so when you [05:03] go to reward him if he's doing a nice [05:05] job or right now since she's still [05:07] staying there you can reward her [05:11] we want him to know that it's his [05:13] behavior that's causing the leash [05:16] pressure as well as the rewards [05:19] so it's not your choice to take the [05:22] leash and place them back on it's his [05:24] choice he's saying I want you to put me [05:26] back on the climb platform and all we're [05:28] doing is compliant we're going no [05:29] problem I got you so are there any other [05:31] questions that you have uh nope this [05:33] this was great um the only thing that I [05:35] do know is we are going on a little [05:37] vacation and my sister's coming to watch [05:39] the dogs is there anything that you know [05:41] about that helps maybe like auto feed or [05:44] just kind of take one thing less off her [05:45] plate yes absolutely there's something [05:47] that's perfect for that and what it is [05:49] it's The Granary camera dual food tray [05:52] this will be perfect for your two pups [05:54] it comes with a 1080p full HD camera [05:57] monitoring 145 degree wide angle lens [06:01] and infrared night vision so you can see [06:03] clearly even at night this allows you to [06:06] keep an eye on your pups in real time [06:08] even if you're out of the house giving [06:10] you that peace of mind it also has [06:12] motion detection that will record and [06:15] save videos of your pups activities [06:17] while you're away you'll even get alerts [06:19] on on your phone so you can watch in [06:21] real time and when you come home simply [06:24] set the feeder on private mode this [06:26] feeder comes with two stainless steel [06:28] bowls and an Innovative splitter system [06:31] that evenly distributes food between the [06:34] bowls to include timed feedings two-way [06:37] chatting customized meals to fit their [06:40] needs and low food reminders with a four [06:43] stage seal system to make sure Annie and [06:45] elfie's food stays nice and fresh with [06:49] the easy to use pet Libro Lite app you [06:52] can plan meal portions diets and feeding [06:55] times from anywhere right from your [06:57] phone and for those of you that have one [06:59] pet they also have the

dogs at the same time [07:14] it may be a little bit too much for them [07:16] so I told her to focus to see if whether [07:19] or not this is too difficult if it is go [07:21] back to training one dog at a time and [07:24] make the environment more difficult and [07:26] when they get better at that then [07:28] bringing in the second dog is going to [07:30] be much easier

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 473/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we are offering free training to [00:02] complete strangers including a sample of [00:05] ari and charlie's freeze-dried dog food [00:07] to show how some simple techniques can [00:10] have a huge impact let's get started [00:13] so we're promoting our new dog food ari [00:16] and charlie's premium cuisine it's [00:18] freeze dried dog food so we're offering [00:19] free training if you're interested and [00:22] we'll see if your dog likes our food [00:25] now the very first step is engagement [00:27] training we're just going to start [00:28] working on getting her condition to the [00:30] word yes is that okay [00:32] yes is going to mean a reward the [00:34] easiest way to think about what our [00:36] words mean to our dogs is what they [00:38] predict so yes [00:40] is going to predict a treat now it's [00:42] also good to throw random words in there [00:44] so i can go pancakes [00:46] rainbow [00:47] yes [00:48] and then there's the marker i also like [00:50] to make the dog come and get the treat [00:52] yes [00:54] so this is going come on baby this is [00:56] going to be what's known as a terminal [00:58] marker a terminal marker means release [01:01] and reward so we're treating yes as a [01:04] terminal marker notice the pause i say [01:06] the word then i move so i'm not doing [01:09] this [01:10] yes [01:11] that's what a lot of people do because [01:13] your mind and your body want to move at [01:15] the same time so we have to separate it [01:18] by about a half second [01:19] yes [01:21] very good come on baby [01:22] excellent [01:24] this is step one this is known as [01:25] engagement training all right basic [01:27] simple session any questions [01:30] no you've actually covered everything so [01:32] try the down again so you're gonna go [01:34] down [01:35] then lower down and now lure [01:38] once he lays down reward [01:40] beautiful same thing with the sit so [01:43] what i like to do for the sit is i'll [01:44] walk back with my hand down at the dog's [01:46] level to keep them walking then when i'm [01:48] ready for them to sit i'll say sit then [01:50] i'll stop and lift [01:52] so give that a shot see if you can do it [01:55] then say the command and now lift and [01:58] then yes and reward beautiful nicely [02:01] done so you also guide him into heel [02:03] right yeah same thing with that stay [02:05] heel and then guide him into the [02:07] position [02:09] and now guide him with the food once he [02:11] gets in the position reward [02:13] [Music] [02:15] very nice the food handling is really [02:17] nice much better than most people so the [02:19] only adjustment you need to make is [02:21] putting the command before the physical [02:23] cue and if you do this every day twice a [02:25] day five minutes each session within a [02:28] week he'll be doing the commands on [02:29] verbal and then you'll have the dog [02:31] performing and then you can just stand [02:32] there go down sit and people be like [02:34] how'd you do that and it's that one tiny [02:36] adjustment makes all the difference in [02:38] the world [02:39] but that's it any questions i appreciate [02:41] it yeah awesome oh yeah freeze-dried is [02:43] awesome it's it's healthy the dogs love [02:45] it and like when i'm training dogs since [02:47] those can be a little bit more on the [02:49] high end freeze dried is just expensive [02:51] i like to mix that in with the dog's [02:53] normal food so i'll train with the dog's [02:55] kibble and then i'll have those pieces [02:58] in so they those will act as a bonus so [03:00] you're training the dogs getting kibble [03:02] then all of a sudden a nice high value [03:04] reward and that actually increases the [03:06] dog's motivation for training by [03:08] throwing in the random freeze-dried [03:10] treats but i'm glad he likes them well [03:12] thank you i appreciate it thank you it's [03:14] very nice meeting you as well oh here [03:16] you can take the rest of these thank you [03:17] notice i say it then i move [03:22] yes [03:24] so you can hear it and then go oh the [03:26] next thing that comes is the reward now [03:28] that i have him doing that now i can [03:30] start using a concept known as luring [03:32] and he loves this food to get him to do [03:34] what we want and then i'm gonna do it [03:36] down [03:42] wait for that butt to go down [03:44] and i gave him a piece right there so if [03:47] a dog is putting an effort to get a [03:48] reward and they don't get it right away [03:50] some give up so right there i was giving [03:52] him one for putting an effort but this [03:54] happens where the dog will keep their [03:56] back end up but they won't lay down [03:57] right away and if that's the case what i [03:59] do is i get down at the dog's level and [04:01] i just keep giving him rewards [04:04] and what'll end up happening is [04:06] he's going to get tired of having his [04:08] butt up in the air [04:09] and his butt will eventually go down [04:12] yes there we go that's what we wanted [04:15] all right well thank you for letting me [04:16] work with your pup that was fun [04:21] [Music] [04:28] [Applause] [04:28] [Music] [04:35] you ==================================================

document,2020-06-17_How_to_Teach_Your_Dog_Scent_Detection__Ep_2_Field_Search_,,,, Part 481/841,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] bring [00:05] [Music] [00:08] free very good Aries [00:16] I have a fun and exciting video for [00:18] everyone today we are going to be [00:19] teaching our dogs how to retrieve a [00:22] drink from the fridge the very first [00:24] thing we want to do is break this [00:25] exercise down into the smallest steps [00:27] possible and then we're going to put it [00:29] together for the final product we're [00:31] going to be using what's known as back [00:32] chaining this is where we start at the [00:34] very last step and we work our way [00:36] forward until we have that picture of [00:38] our dog retrieving the beer from the [00:40] fridge as well as opening the fridge or [00:42] soda whatever you prefer the very first [00:45] step what I like to do is to get the dog [00:46] to bite the item now I'm going to be [00:49] using a PVC pipe that is roughly the [00:51] shape of a can so it's similar to a can [00:54] but I first want to teach her to [00:56] retrieve using this and then once we [00:58] have that picture we transfer it over to [01:01] the final object which is going to be a [01:02] can so what I want to do is I want to [01:04] present it to her if she bites at it [01:06] right away we're going to use our marker [01:08] and then we're going to follow it up [01:09] with a reward since we're not using a [01:11] command we don't have to worry about [01:12] which marker we use you can use your [01:14] your continuation marker for me that's [01:16] yes it just means a treat or you can use [01:19] your terminal marker which means treat [01:21] plus release again we can use either one [01:23] for the first step since we are not [01:25] adding the command yet and if your dog [01:27] doesn't go for it naturally then you can [01:30] move it around to try to kick in that [01:31] prey drive the very first time they [01:33] Place their mouth on the item Mark and [01:35] follow it up with the reward it should [01:36] look something like this [01:38] free good so you see I'm using the [01:40] terminal marker I also put it behind my [01:42] back so when I bring it out free the [01:44] dog's gonna reach for it and grab it [01:45] like I said your dog's probably not [01:46] going to go for it at first and if you [01:48] are struggling you can start off with [01:50] something you know your dog wants to [01:52] bite like a toy or a bully stick [01:54] something that is going to kick in that [01:56] prey drive toy drive play drive or food [01:59] drive whatever you need to do to get [02:00] your dog to do the behavior you can [02:02] always transfer it over to a different [02:03] item later so again we bring it out free [02:05] Mark and reward that's going to be the [02:08] first step the Second Step we're going [02:10] to basically be doing the same thing but [02:13] now we're going to move it in a way [02:14] that's going to make our dog work for it [02:16] they're gonna have to reach and grab [02:17] whether I'm going to aim high to the [02:19] right to the left side down low I want [02:21] her to put in effort to get the item [02:23] once she grabs it again we're going to [02:25] Mark and reward it should look like this [02:27] free very good Ari free excellent [02:33] free very nice [02:36] free notice I'm not doing any commands [02:38] right now I want it free I want her to [02:40] know that she grabs the item we Mark the [02:43] behavior free and then we reward so [02:46] that's going to be the second step [02:48] now the third step we want our dogs to [02:51] learn how to hold the item nice and calm [02:53] so what I'm gonna do for her sit is I'm [02:56] going to place it in her mouth the [02:57] moment the dog takes it in their mouth [02:58] we're gonna have one hand underneath [03:00] their chin and the other one on top of [03:02] their head and I'm gonna pet her and [03:03] reward her for holding it now we're [03:05] gonna start asking for duration [03:07] so on this one you don't want to Mark [03:10] until after your dog holds it for at [03:12] least a second and then we're going to [03:14] make the dog hold it for longer and [03:15] longer as the dog is successful we can [03:17] ask for more time so I'm gonna bring it [03:19] out she's gonna hold it good girl first [03:22] I'm gonna pet her see she dropped it now [03:23] if they go to drop it don't [03:26] Panic or worry oh no the dog dropped it [03:28] calmly pick it up place it back in the [03:30] dog's mouth so good girl very nice free [03:32] so very first time I'm only asking for a [03:36] second or two have her hold it again [03:38] Good Girl free Mark and reward again we [03:41] want to get them comfortable holding the [03:43] item very nice very good lots of Praise [03:46] lots of petting free and then we can [03:48] Mark and follow it up with the reward [03:50] just like every exercise we start with [03:53] continual reinforcement we're rewarding [03:55] every single correct repetition sit very [03:58] nice [04:00] good good girl very good free [04:05] once you have your dog holding it while [04:07] you're petting them you're gonna start [04:09] to remove your hand you want them to be [04:11] able to hold it in their mouth without [04:13] you having to pet them the whole time so [04:15] we're going to ask for her to hold it [04:16] and we're gonna bring our hands away and [04:18] you're gonna see that I'm gonna mark it [04:20] pretty early in the beginning but just [04:22] like we were doing prior to that we'll [04:24] ask for more duration as our dog is [04:26] successful so I'm gonna get her to hold [04:28] it go ahead hurry you can do it you know [04:30] what I want come on good girl we're [04:32] gonna pet and then we're gonna let go [04:34] free Mark and reward and I still keep my [04:37] hands pretty close while I'm doing this [04:39] exercise I'm gonna ask her to hold it [04:41] again good girl I'm gonna release very [04:44] good [04:46] free nice work so now we're getting a [04:49] little bit of that duration sit [04:52] good girl go ahead you know what I want [04:54] all right come on baby girl very good [04:56] very good [05:02] free excellent now you want to make sure [05:05] now I'm progressing through these steps [05:07] pretty quickly when you're doing this [05:08] you're gonna have to take some time on [05:10] each step but you're gonna take some [05:12] time broken down into multiple training [05:14] sessions a training session should be [05:16] very very short and you want to make it [05:19] fun you want to make it enjoyable so [05:21] when I first started doing this with her [05:22] the very first step I would only do that [05:25] I would take a few days to work that [05:27] step and I would make sure the sessions [05:28] are short and you're going to do that [05:29] with each step nice and short sessions [05:32] again to make it as fun as possible the [05:34] fourth step we're going to ask our dog [05:36] to walk with the item in their mouth [05:38] this can be very difficult for some dogs [05:40] if you need to you can continue to [05:42] assist them the way you are doing it on [05:45] the step prior by keeping one hand [05:46] underneath their chin and your [05:48] additional hand on top petting their [05:50] head making sure the item stays in their [05:51] mouth if they drop it just like the step [05:54] prior no big deal pick it up place it [05:56] back in their mouth and go right back [05:57] into the exercise I'm going to ask her [06:00] to take it then I'm going to ask her to [06:01] come to me so I'm going to do what's [06:03] known as the backwards follow exercise [06:05] as she walks in front of me when I stop [06:07] moving she should fit and then I will [06:09] take the item from her it should look [06:11] something like this I'm also going to [06:12] demonstrate how it would look if I need [06:14] to continue to pet and assist the dog [06:16] through the process [06:18] good girl come so I can pet good girl [06:21] very nice and if they drop it we just [06:23] pick it up good good girl and we start [06:24] come on baby [06:27] free so we can do it like that or [06:31] I'm going to have her taken I'm going to [06:32] walk back around this way so you can see [06:34] how she looks when we're doing the [06:36] backwards follow exercise good girl oh [06:38] get a baby [06:39] come on good so now I'm walking [06:42] backwards I'm not worried about perfect [06:44] Precision she made a couple mistakes [06:45] it's no big deal once we stop [06:49] free because that's how I'm gonna want [06:51] her to bring it to me I'm gonna want her [06:52] to bring the item to me and wait till I [06:54] take it from her and stay nice and calm [06:56] so go ahead and take it Ari and let's go [06:59] very good and I'm not using any commands [07:01] I'm using what I like to call [07:03] free informal commands so meaning I'm [07:07] asking the dog to do it by using a [07:09] casual conversation in a sense like go [07:12] ahead and take the item I'm not telling [07:14] her command like bring free that's very [07:17] formal often when I'm first starting out [07:19] I'm using informal so another example of [07:22] an informal command would be like come [07:23] on let's go they know to follow along [07:26] but we don't have to be strict with the [07:28] rules if they make a mistake with an [07:30] informal command it's not a big deal so [07:31] it's something I recommend using in the [07:33] early stages so again we ask them to [07:35] take it go ahead Ari and then we just [07:37] walk backwards and have our dog walk [07:40] with the item in their mouth just like [07:42] that [07:43] free nice job Ari once you get your dog [07:47] to walk with the item in their mouth [07:49] without dropping it then you can move on [07:51] to the next step where we're simply [07:53] going to ask our dog to perform basic [07:55] obedience commands with the items still [07:58] in their mouth now if your dog drops it [08:00] just like before place it back in their [08:02] mouth and go right back into the [08:03] exercise make sure it's short and simple [08:06] if you find yourself running into issues [08:08] that's could be because you're making it [08:10] too difficult too fast so again if you [08:12] realize you've progressed too quickly [08:14] there's nothing wrong with going back a [08:16] step in the training so it should look [08:18] something like this we're going to ask [08:19] our dog to take the item very nice come [08:21] here and then we're gonna ask for [08:22] command sit down [08:24] Center [08:26] very good climb [08:29] all right heel [08:32] free so you want your dog to be able to [08:35] perform multiple commands go climb with [08:38] the item in their mouth that's going to [08:40] get them used to moving around holding [08:42] on to it and waiting until you give them [08:45] the release command or you ask them to [08:47] give it to you before they let go of it [08:49] which is going to be important when [08:51] we're asking our dog to go grab a can [08:53] from the fridge you don't want them to [08:54] run over and just drop it you want them [08:56] to wait until you take it nicely so this [08:58] is going to help with that quite a bit [08:59] for step six we're going to start asking [09:01] our dog to pick the item off the ground [09:03] but we are going to maintain contact [09:05] with it at first so I'm going to move [09:07] the item to the ground when she goes and [09:09] grabs it I'm going to allow her to take [09:10] it my hand is still going to be holding [09:12] the item during this process but [09:14] eventually as your dog starts to [09:16] progress and become better you want to [09:18] start to move your hand farther away [09:20] from the item in the beginning we want [09:22] to make it look as similar as possible [09:24] to the previous steps within the [09:27] training so it should look something [09:28] like this I'm getting my treats ready [09:31] too [09:32] Good Girl free nice [09:37] very good free good girl [09:41] free [09:45] climb break [09:48] good free [09:51] so now this time I'm going to place it [09:53] down instead of making it a race climb [09:56] she's excited to grab it that's what we [09:58] want we want our dogs to have fun with [09:59] this and I'm gonna keep my hand on it [10:01] but I want it to be [10:03] you could have it be completely vertical [10:05] but I like to start with a slight angle [10:08] so it teaches the dog to start to turn [10:11] their head when we have the can sitting [10:13] upright [10:14] all right go ahead Ari [10:16] Good Girl free [10:18] and that was another one of those [10:20] informal commands like we talked about [10:21] earlier all right Glenn [10:27] bring [10:29] free very good and now I'm gonna start [10:32] bringing my hand away from it [10:35] good girl free climb [10:39] until eventually you can get your dog to [10:42] retrieve it [10:43] while you're standing back bring [10:46] very good free [10:48] climb [10:50] that's quiet down young lady that's [10:53] going to be step six now for step seven [10:55] we can start to throw the item and we'll [10:58] allow our dog to go retrieve it while [11:00] it's still moving that's going to become [11:02] an easier process within the training [11:05] because the item is still moving while [11:07] the item's moving we're using some of [11:09] that prey drive as well as some of that [11:12] play drive to get our dog to retrieve [11:14] the item now we were able to get our dog [11:16] to retrieve it while it was stationary [11:18] but this is going to help them get it [11:20] while they're farther away from us and [11:22] bringing it to us so it should look [11:24] something like this [11:31] free very nice Ari for step eight we're [11:34] gonna go through the first seven steps [11:37] once again but this time we're going to [11:39] add the command for this you want to say [11:42] the command before you present the [11:44] physical queue so the way we add the [11:46] command is we're going to say the [11:47] command then we're going to present the [11:49] item and you go through each step so I [11:51] use the command bring so I'm going to [11:53] say bring [11:55] free then I present the item bring [11:58] free [12:02] bring [12:08] free it's not always going to be perfect [12:11] bring free very good and remember now we [12:15] want to start changing positions a [12:16] little bit more all right climb [12:18] bring [12:20] free [12:21] bring free [12:26] bring free [12:28] bring free [12:31] very good [12:33] bring [12:35] good girl come here very good very good [12:43] and so you see down [12:45] heal [12:47] I'm just going through each step down [12:49] down climb [12:52] come [12:54] free that we went through prior to this [12:58] without the command but now we're adding [12:59] the command climb [13:05] bring [13:07] free [13:09] bring [13:11] free [13:13] bring [13:15] free [13:16] now we can start tossing it climb [13:19] bring [13:23] free [13:24] bring [13:29] free [13:30] for the next step we are going to start [13:32] placing the item close to where the dog [13:35] is going to be retrieving it from we [13:37] want it to be at an elevated position [13:39] very similar to how it's going to be in [13:41] the fridge so I'm going to be using this [13:42] chair right now and what I want to do is [13:44] I want to put my dog into the heel [13:46] position all right heal [13:49] sit I'm going to place the item on the [13:52] chair and I'm going to ask her to bring [13:54] it to me and we're nice and close to the [13:55] item bring [13:59] free good we're gonna start asking for a [14:02] little bit more control now [14:04] she barks when she gets excited down [14:09] down thank you [14:12] and each time we're going to build more [14:14] distance [14:15] bring [14:17] very good [14:19] out thank you Ari all right heal yes [14:24] down [14:30] down bring [14:35] out Bring I want them to bring it to me [14:38] with the cans sideways so I'm not going [14:40] to accept it if she brings it the wrong [14:42] way which she did right there so I just [14:44] adjusted it and now I'm going to take it [14:45] out free and I'm gonna reward her if you [14:49] notice there's some times where I take [14:51] the item from her and I say free [14:53] and there are times where I take the [14:56] item and I tell her go ahead and grab it [14:57] already bring and I tell her out then I [15:01] Stay Free the reason why I'm doing that [15:03] is because when I say free and I'm [15:05] grabbing and still in her mouth I'm [15:06] marking the behavior of her holding it [15:08] I'm telling her great job you're holding [15:10] the item that's what I want you can now [15:11] release it and I'm gonna pay you for it [15:13] then there's times where I'm asking her [15:15] to release it through a command and I'm [15:17] rewarding her for releasing it after I [15:19] ask her to one I'm rewarding her for [15:21] holding it and the other one I'm [15:23] rewarding her for releasing it so that's [15:25] why I'm doing it those ways because I [15:26] want to reward both options so she [15:29] understands that great job you're [15:30] holding it that's what I want but also [15:32] great job You released it when I asked [15:34] you to [15:35] here [15:36] all right heal [15:38] yes [15:40] down [15:47] down [15:48] sit bring [15:55] free very good Ari [15:58] climb so now we're almost at the last [16:01] position where she's going to be where I [16:02] want her to retrieve it so now I'm going [16:04] to come back over here set it back down [16:09] I'm going to stand next to her on this [16:11] one and I'm going to tell her to bring [16:18] very good and you see she fixed it that [16:19] time on her own [16:21] free nice job Ari very good [16:25] climb [16:27] and for this last one I'm going to be [16:30] sitting down [16:35] if I need to I can give the command and [16:37] then stand up and help her and that's [16:39] something you might have to do so we'll [16:41] see if she responds off just the command [16:42] if not I'm going to stand up and give [16:44] her a little bit of assistance bring so [16:46] she's doing it so that made it easy [16:49] good fix it very nice [16:51] free [16:52] excellent [16:55] if I asked her to do it and she didn't [16:58] get up right away all right climb [17:00] I'm gonna use just a random word to show [17:03] you what I would have done so let's say [17:05] get it for example so I would have gone [17:07] get it [17:09] and then I would have pointed and of [17:12] course the item would have been there [17:13] and then she would have brought it over [17:14] so if you need to get up free to help [17:17] your dog go ahead and do that we want to [17:19] make sure they're successful climb now [17:22] we're going to progress to The Next Step [17:24] so we want our dog to be able to grab [17:26] the item out of the fridge so I'm going [17:28] to move the chair [17:30] and now I'm going to start opening the [17:33] fridge [17:34] when you first start you want the fridge [17:36] completely empty right now I have a [17:39] bunch of items in it but we want it to [17:42] be open [17:43] and we want to set it right in the [17:46] center where we want our dog to grab it [17:48] first time I do it I stand right next to [17:51] the fridge to show her Ari bring I keep [17:55] my hand by it so she knows which one [17:57] free [17:58] down are you down and I should have gave [18:01] her the treat once I said free so I made [18:03] a mistake right there she was waiting [18:04] for her reward [18:05] also when you first start this you may [18:07] not be able to keep it straight up and [18:08] down even though we went through the [18:10] steps where we had our dog pick it up [18:11] when it was vertical you still may have [18:13] to hold it on a slight angle to show [18:15] your dog that they need to turn their [18:17] head to get it go ahead and bring Ari [18:19] good girl [18:21] free nice job [18:24] all right heal down [18:28] down [18:30] and now I can keep my hand close to it [18:32] but now I'm not touching it bring [18:35] very good [18:37] free [18:39] and we're just going to continue to [18:40] build distance all right heal down [18:44] and we want to get to the point where we [18:47] have it in the fridge all right go climb [18:50] and we ask our dog to bring it all the [18:53] way from the position where they're [18:54] going to be and again if you need to you [18:55] can get up and help your dog bring [19:00] very good [19:02] free all right free no don't keep [19:04] chewing it out [19:06] so I told her to out since she thought [19:09] that [19:10] she wanted to continue to play with it [19:11] and she was using the terminal marker [19:13] free as okay I want to play with this [19:15] toy so reward me with this toy go climb [19:17] all right [19:19] good now that we have our dog grabbing [19:21] it out of the fridge the next step is [19:23] teaching our dog how to open the fridge [19:25] this is much easier than you might think [19:27] and I'm going to show you how we're [19:28] going to do that now we want to teach [19:30] our dogs how to open the fridge I like [19:32] to use a rag you can use any sort of toy [19:35] rag cloth that your dog can grab in [19:37] order to pull to open the fridge now [19:39] first we have to teach our dogs to pull [19:41] playing tug of war is a very easy way to [19:43] do this now Ari loves to play tug so I [19:46] just had to let her know that this was [19:47] another toy that she can pull the only [19:49] downside to this is when your dog knows [19:52] they can pull it when it's attached to [19:54] the fridge is they might think the game [19:56] of pulling it against the fridge is what [19:59] they're supposed to do so when I first [20:01] started teaching this to Ari she [20:02] actually pulled the fridge a little bit [20:04] she opened the door and she continued to [20:06] pull because she's like I'm pulling I'm [20:07] having fun this is the game so I had to [20:09] let her know no it's not pulling to to [20:12] pull but rather pull to open the fridge [20:14] and once she understood that it became [20:15] much easier and the way that I did that [20:17] once she pulled and opened the door then [20:19] I told her break which is her release [20:21] word but she also realized okay he's [20:24] telling me to release this item I could [20:26] have said out as well which is a great [20:28] option and then direct her into the [20:30] fridge to grab the item and we present [20:33] it free they pull [20:35] good girl good good good yes [20:37] excellent so I marked the behavior of [20:39] her pulling and I give her the reward [20:41] free so I'm just using the terminal [20:43] marker very good she pulls free [20:46] yes and I'm going to use the other mark [20:48] because she's now looking at yes as [20:50] getting the treat and free as grabbing [20:52] the toy good girl when she pulls yes [20:55] yes nice [20:58] good job Ari free [21:03] good [21:07] yes and so I'm waiting for her to pull [21:09] now that I have her pulling each time I [21:11] present the tug now I want to place it [21:13] on the fridge but when I first do this [21:16] I'm going to hold it next to the fridge [21:18] and I'm gonna ask her to get it go ahead [21:20] free [21:21] she pulls good girl nice job [21:25] out are you up no oh good girl [21:29] so again we want to take the item and we [21:32] want to hold it [21:33] next to the fridge [21:36] free they bite and pull good girl very [21:39] good now you can out all right you can [21:41] allow them to pull and you can just [21:43] continue playing tug or you can release [21:44] it like I did so you can also tell them [21:47] free free good and she pulls and now [21:49] we're gonna play tug for a minute very [21:51] good Ari out [21:54] free good girl Ari out [22:00] free nice good job yes [22:03] good and we're gonna reward her [22:05] all right go climb [22:07] now we're going to attach it to the [22:09] fridge the way that I do that is I use [22:10] zip ties and I'm going to show you how I [22:11] do that as well so all I'm going to do [22:13] is I'm going to take the rag and I'm [22:15] going to roll it up [22:18] then in the very center is where I'm [22:20] going to put the first zip tie [22:28] cut off the [22:30] extra end [22:32] and now I'm going to take the next zip [22:33] tie [22:34] and that's the one that I'm going to use [22:36] to attach it to the door [22:43] now we have the rag on the door and our [22:46] dog's going to be able to use this to [22:48] open the fridge once my dog opens the [22:51] fridge I'm going to use the terminal [22:52] marker and I'm going to reward her with [22:54] a toy so I want her to know it's the act [22:55] of opening the fridge and when we first [22:57] do this I hold the rag because I want to [23:00] make the pitcher as close to the same [23:02] one that we were doing earlier to make [23:04] it easier for a dog-free [23:06] see she she gets excited and pulls the [23:09] fridge now free good she's a melon was [23:12] so they have a little bit more dry free [23:13] one of the [23:15] free and if your dog goes to open it [23:18] like that Mark and reward [23:20] free good girl very good and she wants [23:24] to grab one of the items because we've [23:25] practiced this already [23:27] go ahead [23:29] free good girl and I don't have to put [23:32] this on a command because this free in [23:35] order to get the can free out of the [23:38] fridge they just have to know how to [23:39] open it free and again when I say free [23:41] that's letting her know you did the [23:43] behavior correctly and I'm going to [23:44] reward you free [23:47] good job so you see how she's can free [23:49] she's continuing to open it that's [23:50] excellent now we can go to the final [23:52] step which is getting them to take the [23:54] item out of the fridge but also opening [23:56] it all right go climb all right go climb [24:01] climb [24:03] now I'm going to take the item [24:07] and I'm going to place it in the fridge [24:09] I'm letting my dog watch [24:11] also when you first do this make sure [24:13] there's no other items in the fridge [24:14] where the dog's gonna be grabbing it you [24:16] want to make it as easy as possible for [24:18] them so when she opens the fridge I'm [24:20] going to help her if needed to get the [24:22] item because they'll start to understand [24:24] open the fridge but now opening the [24:26] fridge is a game and we want them to [24:28] know that that's just one of the [24:29] additional steps that they need to take [24:31] in order to get the item that we want [24:33] them to retrieve [24:34] and so I'm going to tell her bring she [24:37] should come here open break good show [24:39] her the item and now I'm gonna walk back [24:41] getting her to bring it to me free [24:43] marking and rewarding once you have your [24:46] dog [24:47] go climb [24:49] doing that we want to continue to build [24:51] distance just like we did in the step [24:52] prior to that once your dog is [24:54] successfully grabbing the PVC pipe out [24:58] of the fridge [25:00] then you can start to progress to the [25:02] can so let's see how she does if I come [25:04] over here and I tell her bring [25:07] [Music] [25:09] good good Ari [25:13] nice job very good [25:16] free very good and it's not always going [25:18] to be perfect that's fine all right [25:20] climb your dog will get better the more [25:22] they understand so she's a very high [25:25] drive dog and as I said some of the [25:28] things that I had to struggle with was [25:30] her wanting to play tug with the fridge [25:31] so I had a teacher not to do that and [25:33] then the next struggle was teaching her [25:35] how to hold the can nice and soft [25:38] Malinois are not known for having a soft [25:41] bite in order to get her to carry the [25:43] can softly I went through roughly 30 [25:46] cans of sparkling water before she was [25:50] able to hold it without puncturing it [25:52] now she knows she needs to grab it she [25:54] needs to be very light with her bite in [25:56] order to ensure that she doesn't [25:57] puncture the can you're gonna have to [25:59] adjust depending on the dog that you're [26:01] working with and that's going to be the [26:03] art of dog training but if you follow [26:05] this step-by-step process you will be [26:07] able to find success within your [26:09] training and have a dog that can [26:11] retrieve any item out of the fridge that [26:14] you would like so you're gonna go [26:15] through each step that we just went [26:17] through with the canned items so now you [26:19] have your dog retrieving the soda or the [26:21] turkey Brew whatever it is you want your [26:23] dog to retrieve from the fridge I hope [26:25] you liked today's episode let me know [26:27] what you think about it in the comments [26:29] below of course as always please hit [26:30] that like button subscribe and
