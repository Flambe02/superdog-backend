              Vestibulum
              The vestibulum is an irregularly shaped cavity, roughly
              3 mm in diameter in dogs1,3. Rostrally it communicates
              with the scala vestibuli, caudally with the semicircular
              canals3. The medial wall contains two depressions:
              the elliptical recess of the utricle caudodorsally and
              the spherical recess of the saccule rostroventrally.          B
              The lateral wall contains two fenestrations: the oval
              window closed by the base of the stapes dorsally and
              the membrane-covered round window ventrally. The
              semicircular canals open into the vestibulum caudally.
              The smallest foramen on the vestibular wall is that of
              the minute vestibular aqueduct, which transports endo-
              lymph to the endolymphatic sac adjacent to the dura.

              In the early stages of otitis externa there is some hyper-   the Cocker Spaniel48. In this breed there may be a pre-

              this represents a breed-specific aetiopathogenic             although the papillary changes in the ceruminous
              pathway is not known. The progression of clinical and        glands may be sufficiently florid that discrete polypous

              Puncture of the tympanum
              Puncture of the tympanum most commonly arises as a
              result of infection or trauma61. The well-documented
              sequence of haemostasis, inflammation, fibroblastic
              and collagenous proliferation, and epithelialisation,
              which characterises healing of skin wounds62, is not fol-
              lowed in the tympanum62. In particular, the epithelium
              migrates over and bridges the defect before a granu-
              lation bed is established beneath60–64. This adaptation
              presumably results in a more rapid restoration of tym-
              panic function than might be achieved if the cutaneous
              pattern was followed. Thus, simple, elective myringot-

              The epithelial lining of the normal middle ear is a mod-
              ified respiratory pattern with a squamous or cuboidal
              appearance (Fig. 1.45)70. A few ciliated and secretory
              cells are scattered among the epithelial cells. There is
              a thin lamina propria between the epithelium and the
              periosteum overlying the bone of the tympanic bulla70.
                  When exposed to irritant chemicals, which may enter
              via a punctured tympanum for example, the epithelium
              responds with a range of inflammatory reactions propor-
              tional to the toxicity of the chemical and, presumably,
              its concentration and the period of exposure. There may
              be a mild, and potentially reversible, perivascular derma-       B

              cavity60,62,71. If the irritation continues, the low cuboidal
              or squamous epithelium becomes columnar with a pap-
              illary appearance69. Secretory cells are visible between
              some of the columnar epithelial cells. Glandular or even
              cystic structures may be found within the granulation
              tissue; they may become so large that they fill the middle
              ear (Figs 1.46A, B). The lamina propria underlying the
              epidermis thickens and may take on the appearance of
              loose, oedematous granulation tissue70–72 with collagen,

              The round window membrane is located in the medial

              of the cochlea from the cavity of the middle ear and

              The approach to a case of otitis externa is no different
              to that of any disease: the signalment will allow the cli-        Visual examination and palpation of the auricular cartilages

                 Consideration of the history and signalment will               Histopathological examination of biopsy samples
              allow the clinician to make a provisional differential
              diagnosis, which will be further amended once the
              physical examination has been performed. At this point,
              a number of techniques can be utilised to investigate
              the otitis (Table 2.1), with the objective of defining, or
              staging, the otitis:
              • Foreign body or ectoparasite (Fig. 2.1).
              • Uni- or bilateral peracute otitis (Fig. 2.2).
              • Uni- or bilateral chronic atopic-type otitis (Fig.
                  2.3).
              • Uni- or bilateral chronic gram-negative-type
                  ulcerative otitis (Fig. 2.4).
              • Calcification of auricular cartilages.
              • Suspicion or evidence of underlying disease
                  (allergy, pemphigus foliaceus, seborrhoea) or
                  known breed predisposition (Fig. 2.5).
              • Otic neoplasia (Fig. 2.6).                                    Fig. 2.1 Acute otitis externa associated with a grass awn

                  2.7)?

              Staging, or defining the type of otitis, allows for             potential for complications, allows the clinician to

              The external aspect of the tympanum, as viewed with
              an otoscope, is divided into two unequal parts by the
              manubrium of the malleus. This is attached along the

                 Otoscopic examination may reveal the presence of
              ectoparasites, such as O. cynotis or Otobius megnini (Fig.
              2.23). Otodectic mites are often accompanied by the
              presence of a crumbly brown discharge (Fig. 2.24). Not
              all infestations are inflammatory and associated with
              pruritus.



               Do not expect to visualise O. cynotis unfailingly: otic
               cerumen mixed with liquid paraffin and examined under
               a microscope will allow a better chance of diagnosis if

              Epidermal hyperplasia, nodules, tumours, polyps and
              foreign bodies within the external ear canal are easily
              visualised during otoscopy (Fig. 2.25), although clean-
              ing of the external ear canal may be necessary. This is
              particularly the case for cats where the whole canal may
              fill with purulent discharge if an otic tumour or polyp
              is present (Fig. 2.26). Otic masses should be biopsied –
              pinch samples taken with biopsy forceps are adequate17.
              Elderly cats may exhibit numerous blue-black coloured
              papules and nodules – ceruminous cystomatosis (Fig.
              2.27), sometimes numerous enough to almost occlude a
              portion of the external ear canal. These may be treated
              by surgical removal or laser ablation5,18,19.

              that they engender localised microbial infection11.
                  The tympanum should be examined for colour,
              texture and integrity; it is usually dark grey or
              brown in cases of otitis externa 8 . In contrast to

              detect that staphylococci are larger than streptococci27.
                 Generally, even in first opinion cases, the observation
              of bacilli should prompt sampling for bacterial culture
              and sensitivity testing27. This is particularly important
              if Gram’s staining is not performed, since clinicians
              cannot differentiate Pseudomonas spp. from Clostrid-
              ium spp. or Bacillus spp.27. Unless a recurrent case is
              involved, it is not usually necessary to submit samples
              from otitis externa associated with cocci for bacterial
              culture and sensitivity testing. Indeed, in one study
              testing achieved a sensitivity of 59% for gram-positive
              cocci and 69% for gram-negative rods, compared with          Fig. 2.52 Photomicrograph illustrating squames and

              ear, is complex and subject both to breed and individual

              a thorough knowledge of the spatial relationships
              between the skull and the ear is essential if the radio-

              pathological changes to the region are unlikely to be
              symmetrical. Thus, provided a good quality, symmet-

                 Any one of several radiographic views will provide
              information on the middle ear but no one view can
              provide a complete picture. Therefore, at least two dif-
              ferent radiograph views must be included in any radio-
              graphic investigation.

              recording electrodes were inserted subcutaneously: a

              be stimulated, a common (ground) electrode at the base
              of the pinna of the other ear, and a reference electrode

                  Hearing loss is a common disorder in many dog and         these procedures will allow differentiation between
              cat breeds and auditory dysfunction and its clinical con-     conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. The great

                 Thioglycolate preparations have been evaluated for
              use as depilatory agents within the canine external ear

              symmetrical pinnal alopecia/hyperpigmentation. Some         may present as marginal wounds on the pinna that con-

              elsewhere. Other diseases, such as atopy, initially may
              affect the pinna but the upper aspect of the external ear
              canal is usually involved as well. Finally, the pinna may
              be involved as part of a generalised condition such as an
              endocrinopathy, a defect in keratinisation, or pemphi-
              gus foliaceus.
                 In common with skin elsewhere on the body, the
              pinnal skin responds with a range of primary and sec-
              ondary lesions. However, primary lesions, other than
              nodules, are rare, as is chronic lichenification.

                                                                          Fig. 4.1 Lacerated pinnal margin in an entire tom cat

               very rarely affects the pinna. Thus, the presence of
               papules and pustules is most commonly associated with
               pemphigus foliaceus, itself a rare condition.


              Scale, crust, alopecia and self-excoriation are the most
              common secondary lesions.

              4.2 PINNAL TRAUMA

              Trauma to the pinna, particularly in cats, is relatively
              common. Fight wounds result in torn pinnae (Fig. 4.1)
              and, often, prolific bleeding. Surprisingly, abscess for-   Fig. 4.2 Traumatic wounds on the pinnal margin of a

              Trombiculidiasis results from infestation with the
              parasitic larval stage of free living mites18. The most
              common infestation results from contact with larvae of
              Neotrombicula autumnalis and Eutrombicula alfredugesi,
              typically in the late summer; hence the name ‘harvest

              Pemphigus foliaceus
              Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is a superficial pustular der-
              matosis33. The pustules in PF are a result of a loss of
              cohesion between keratinocytes due to immunoglobu-
              lin G (IgG) targeting the protein desmocollin-1, a com-
              ponent of the desmosomes34.
                 In the case of PF the pustules are the primary lesion,
              but they may be very transient and most commonly
              cases are presented with crusting, erosion and alope-
              cia on the nasal planum, face and pinnae (Fig. 4.19).

              This is also known as pinnal margin vasculopathy.
              Morris cites Dachshunds and Rhodesian Ridgebacks
              as perhaps being predisposed42. Peripheral pinnal ery-
              thema and crusting (Fig. 4.24A) are early signs and cya-
              nosis might be noted42. Local necrosis results in fissures

              (250 mg of each, three times daily, for dogs less than
              10 kg in weight and 500 mg of each, three times daily,
              for dogs over 10 kg in weight) can be tried41,42, or pen-
              toxifylline at 15 mg/kg three times a day or 30 mg/kg
              twice a day. Morris also recommends oral vitamin E, in
              conjunction with pentoxifylline, twice daily at a dose of
              200 IU (small dogs), 400 IU (medium dogs) or 600 IU
              (large dogs)42.
                 Fenbendazole-related drug eruption was reported to            B
              be the cause of bilateral necrosis of the distal third of
              both pinnae in one dog43. Patently, the degree of tissue
              damage and the extent of the lesions is much worse
              than in proliferative thrombovascular pinnal necrosis,
              described above. However, drug eruption remains an
              important differential, albeit a very rare one.

              Environmental dermatoses
              Actinic dermatitis and pinnal squamous cell
              carcinoma
              Actinic (solar) dermatitis results from exposure to ultra-
              violet B radiation and it is most commonly seen on the
              tips of the pinnae of white haired dogs and cats5. Lesions
              on the nasal planum may also be seen. In dogs a predi-          Fig. 4.24 Proliferative thrombovascular necrosis of the

              Idiopathic defects in keratinisation
              A defect in keratinisation may be primary or second-
              ary. Primary defects reflect inherent errors in the
              control of the various processes associated with epi-
              dermal turnover, sebaceous gland function and the
              production of hair. The disease is best documented in
              American Cocker Spaniels52,53 but other breeds such as

                 Current treatment guidelines do not recommend
              ‘spot’ treatment, even of localised lesions, and instead
              advise a combination of systemic medication and
              topical therapy is used82:

                     shampoo twice a week.
                 • Lime sulphur rinses, twice weekly, applied with

              Feline poxvirus
              Feline poxvirus infection (synonym: cowpox) is caused
              by an Orthopoxvirus, presumably transmitted by bites
              from small rodents87. There is a seasonal incidence that
              peaks in the autumn, and, understandably, there is an
              increased incidence in rural, outdoor cats88. Primary
              lesions appear as transient erythematous papules or
              erosions, usually on the anterior part of the body87,88.
              Some 10–14 days later secondary lesions appear as
              papules, which rapidly crust and become alopecic ero-
              sions (Fig. 4.33). Contagion to cats in the same house-     Fig. 4.33 Multiple erythematous erosions on the head

              disposed, particularly the Boxer, English Bulldog, and
              Scottish Terrier107,108. The most common site for the
              tumour is the dorsal pinna107,108. These are solitary,
              elevated, domed, erythematous, well-demarcated, min-
              imally pruritic lesions (Fig. 4.37) that are often reported
              to show rapid growth. Occasionally they are ulcerated
              and very rarely they have been reported to be multiple.
              Canine cutaneous histiocytomas are benign lesions and
              response to surgery is close to 100%107,108. The prin-
              cipal differential diagnoses are mast cell tumours and
              granulomas.

              mast cell tumours may occur in young dogs (hence the
              inclusion of canine cutaneous histiocytoma as a dif-
              ferential diagnosis) the incidence increases with age,
              peaking at 8 or 9 years old109,110. Boxers and other
              breeds with Bulldog ancestry are predisposed, but mast
              cell tumours may occur in any dog109,110. The clinical
              appearance of the tumour is very variable but single
              cutaneous lesions less than 3 cm in diameter are the
              most common presentation (Fig. 4.38)109,110. The diag-
              nosis of mast cell tumour is made by a combination of
              cytology and histopathology.
                 Clinical management of all but single nodules has
              been transformed with the advent of masitinib111,112.
              However, masitinib would not normally be indicated
              for solitary pinnal mast cell tumours, which are best         Fig. 4.37 Erythematous nodule on the pinna of a dog –

              Granulomatous lesions
              Granulomas may be solitary or multiple (Fig. 4.39).
              Clinically, they are usually non-pruritic and are usually
              nodular in appearance, slowly growing, and domed
              in appearance113. Occasionally they may be exuda-
              tive, or ulcerated and crusted (Fig. 4.40), particularly
              when associated with eosinophilic furunculosis, a per-
              acute nasal dermatitis114. Occasionally, clinicians may
              encounter what appears to be a more chronic eosino-
              philic granulomatous dermatitis (Fig. 4.41). Whether,
              or how, these relate to the peracute furunculotic variant     Fig. 4.38 Large, erythematous, eroded mast cell tumour

              THE CONCAVE ASPECT OF THE PINNA

              Atopy
              Dogs with atopy frequently have otitis externa121–124.
              Lesions within the upper portion of the external ear
              canal are frequently associated with erythema, and even
              lichenification, on the concave aspect of the pinnae
              (Figs 4.46A, B).
                  Otitis externa and any accompanying pinnal lesions
              do not respond well to immunotherapy125, often requir-
              ing long-term additional management measures over
              and above immunotherapy, for example. The author’s
              experience with oclacitinib (Apoquel® Zoetis), albeit on
              a few cases, suggest that it might have a much better effect   Fig. 4.44 Multiple, small, granulomatous papules on

              resent the application of Cortavance, in which case a
              steroid-containing otic preparation may be applied.

              Allergic contact dermatitis
              Allergic contact dermatitis is rare in dogs, and pub-
              lished case reports even more so124. Allergic contact
              dermatitis appears to be extremely rare in the cat125.

              Atopy is associated with erythema and oedema of the
              ear canal but there is usually little exudation4. Repeated
              episodes of inflammation result in more widespread
              erythema and hyperplasia (Fig. 5.4). Animals may be
              presented with what is described as an acute episode
              of otitis externa but examination will reveal signs of
              chronic change. These episodes of repeated inflam-
              mation result in progressive stenosis of the external

                Zoonotic lesions may occur on in-contact human
              members of the household25. Vesicles, wheals, erythe-
              matous papules and excoriations on the arms and torso
              have been reported30.

              Lifecycle, transmission, and prevalence
              Females lay eggs (Fig. 5.15) and cement them to the
              epidermal surface. They hatch to yield six-legged larvae
              that undergo two moults through eight-legged proto-
              nymphs and deutonymphs. The emerging deutonymph
              is approached by, and attached to, an adult male mite (Fig.
              5.16) and, if it is female, copulation occurs. Although the
              life cycle of 3 weeks is confined to the host, it has been     Fig. 5.15 Photomicrograph of Otodectes spp. ova

              long periods27. Nevertheless, contact with an infected host
              is still believed to be the main route of transmission25.
                  The prevalence of O. cynotis in dogs’ ears was assessed
              as 29.1% in one study of 700 ears, with a significant
              predisposition in dogs with pendulous and semi-erect
              pinnae as compared to erect pinnae31. This study also
              reported that there was a highly significant correlation
              between the presence of mites and otitis externa. Asymp-
              tomatic carriage of Otodectes cynotis can occur in dogs. For
              example, in a case series detailing Otodectes cynotis in 700
              ears, lesions and pruritus were absent in 114. Fewer cases
              were reported in the summer months. One study sug-
              gested a seasonal incidence for the disease32; however, a
              very large study could find no evidence of a seasonal inci-    Fig. 5.16 Photomicrograph of a deutonymph attached

              Ticks
              The spinous ear tick, O. megnini (Fig. 5.27), is most
              frequently found in the southern and south-western
              regions of the USA. However, the increased mobility of
              owners and their pets means that the tick may be found
              in almost any region of the USA38,39. The larvae (six
              legs, yellow-pink colour) and adults (eight legs, blue-
              grey colour) are parasitic and infest the external ear
              canal of both dogs and cats to the extent that in some
              cases the external ear canal is entirely filled with the
              parasites. Acute otitis externa results. Ixodic, hard ticks
              such as Demacentor spp., and the rabbit ‘stick tight flea’
              (Spillopsyllus cuniculi) are usually found on the pinnae
              and head, rather than within the external ear canal.

              Endocrinopathy
              Endocrinopathies are often cited as underlying causes
              of chronic ceruminous otitis externa. However, neither
              hypothyroidism nor hyperadrenocorticism are com-
              monly associated with otitis externa40–42, allergy is
              a much more common cause. Diabetes mellitus has
              been associated with otitis externa43. Zur et al. found
              that rod-shaped bacteria (identified cytologically)
              were correlated with otitis externa in dogs with endo-
              crinopathy7. Gonadal hormone changes (e.g. Sertoli
              cell tumours), in contrast, may have a profound effect
              on cutaneous glandular function and may therefore be          Fig. 5.28 Otitis externa associated with a Sertoli cell

              pyogranuloma56. In one study nearly 20% of cases of           A
              otic grass awn penetration were associated with rupture
              of the tympanum (Figs 5.41A, B), suggesting that otitis
              media should be considered in long-standing cases,
              even where the tympanum is intact54. Support for this
              comes from the study by Saridomichelakis et al. who
              found that a grass seed within the external ear canal
              was positively correlated with rupture of the tympanic
              membrane5.
                 The most common bacteria associated with grass
              awns are streptococci, although Staphylococcus spp.,
              Pasteurella spp. and Actinomycetes spp. may also be cul-
              tured54.

              Obstructive and neoplastic disease
              Obstructive disease of the external canal is usually uni-
              lateral. It is relatively unusual, in the author’s experi-    B
              ence, for owners to recognise the presence of a lesion.
              Most often, the dog or cat is presented for one, or
              several, associated clinical signs, such as otic discharge
              and malodour, pruritus, pain or head tilt57. Local metas-
              tasis may result in vestibular signs.

              EAR CANAL NEOPLASIA

              Neoplasia of the external ear canal is uncommon57. In
              general, otic neoplasia in cats tends to be malignant57–60
              and they are likely to be found either in the vertical or
              the horizontal canal with equal frequency58,59. Otic dis-
              charge, pruritus and pain are common, whereas neu-
              rological signs are rare57,58. Canine ear canal neoplasia    Fig. 5.41A, B A: Grass awn penetration of the tympa-

              When neurological signs accompany otic neoplasia, a
              generally poor prognosis is predicted since this usually
              indicates middle ear involvement and squamous cell              Papillomas, basal cell tumours and ceruminous

              Ceruminous gland adenoma and ceruminous
              gland hyperplasia
              Ceruminous gland neoplasia is the most common cause
              of obstructive disease of the external ear canal in dogs
              and cats57. Benign ceruminous gland neoplasia tends
              to present with signs of obstructive otitis externa (Fig.
              5.42): pruritus, head shaking, malodour, otorrhoea,         Figs 5.43A, B Pedunculated mass (polypoid fibroma) at

                 Note that ceruminous cystomatotis is a non-neoplas-
              tic, hyperplastic change characterised by, usually, mul-
              tiple, often clustered, pigmented papules and nodules
              within the external ear canal57,62. The condition is most
              often seen in middle aged to older cats57, and is often,
              although not always, associated with chronic otitis
              externa (Fig. 5.44). Ablation of the hyperplastic tissue
              may also be achieved by surgery, or by tissue ablation

               Remember that the presence of grass seeds in the

              examination of the tympanic membrane. Owners may
              express concern that anaesthesia is suggested. It must

              large external ear canals (Fig. 5.63) making it hard to
              understand the pathogenesis in some cases. Apparently
              spontaneous peracute onset may be noted, although
              the majority of cases will have a history of chronic, or
              chronic relapsing otitis and/or, associated skin disease.
              Pseudomonas otitis is sufficiently common for most
              veterinarians to see a case two or three times a year.
              Many cases resolve with appropriate treatment.


               Note that atopic dogs in Northern Europe rarely
               suffer from pseudomonal otitis, notwithstanding that
               many such individuals suffer chronic otitis externa
               and possess pendulous pinnae. In hotter, more humid
               environments, pseudomonal complications of atopic
               otitis are more common.


              Dogs with P. aeruginosa ear infection typically present
              with a purulent and malodourous otitis externa. Addi-
              tionally, there may be extensive ulceration (Fig. 5.64),
              obvious pain, head shaking or even head tilt, and evidence      Fig. 5.63 Large external ear canals in a 95 kg Mastiff.

              be cleaned to allow proper examination of the deeper por-
              tions of the ear canal. Cleaning also removes cerumen,
              exudate and organic debris, all of which can deleteriously
              affect the action of any subsequent antibiotic treatment.


               As many as 83% of cases of pseudomonal otitis externa
               may have otitis media121.


              The aim of the clinical investigations is to:
              • Perform cytological and bacteriological sampling
                and assess underlying disease.
              • Clean and dry the external ear canal.
              • Identify if there is otitis media.
              • Suppress otic inflammation.
              • Eliminate the pseudomonas bacteria.
              • Put in place a treatment regime to prevent
                recurrence.
              • Identify and eliminate, or manage, predisposing
                problems and underlying disease.

              most common cause of para-aural abscessation however,
              is incomplete debridement of the epithelial lining of the
              external bony meatus during previous TECA213,216. In a
              series of 17 dogs with para-aural abscessation reported        Fig. 5.74 Close up of the area in Fig. 5.73 after clip-

              infection rates are still as high as 2–10%161,216-220. When
              performed for aural cholesteatoma, recurrent deep
              infection rate approaches 50%221. Deep wound infec-
              tions are much less common in cats64,222. Incomplete
              removal of secretory epithelium lining the tympanic
              bulla or osseous canal, retained infected ear canal car-
              tilage, osteomyelitis of the ossicles, inadequate drainage
              of the middle ear through the auditory tube and parotid
              salivary gland damage are factors implicated in the aeti-
              opathogenesis211,212,216,219–221. Performing TECA with
              VBO instead of LBO does not reduce the risk of deep
              infection161.
                  Clinical signs of pain upon opening the mouth, para-

              from 1 month to years after TECA–LBO211,212,216,221.
              In addition there may be signs of otitis interna such as       Fig. 5.75 A large para-aural, closed abscess was opened,
              ataxia and head tilt toward the affected side, and of facial   sampled and drained to reduce local swelling, pain and

              tion with respect to the cause of the condition and the
              recommended surgical approach (Fig. 5.76).


               A surgical treatment is recommended for treatment of
               para-aural abscessation that developed after previous
               surgery, and can include a lateral approach to the
               middle ear or VBO211,212,216,221 (see Chapter 18 Surgery
               of the Ear, Sections 18.7–18.9).


              If diagnostic imaging demonstrates signs of remnant
              tissue of the horizontal ear canal or tissue suggestive of
              retained epithelium within the external bony meatus,
              a lateral approach is preferred. In all other cases it         Fig. 5.76 Computed tomographic transverse image of

              and signs such as head tilt, ataxia and nystagmus can be
              seen (see Chapter 7 Diseases of the Inner Ear). Note           A
              that neurological signs in the dog are uncommon: they
              occurred in only 5 of 28 cases in one series on otitis
              media in dogs1,2.
                 A histological study of 100 middle ears from 50
              normal cats revealed that gross evidence of otitis media
              was present in 14% cats, and that 48% revealed histo-
              logical evidence of ongoing or previous inflammation3.
              Support for this comes from a retrospective assessment
              of 310 cats, which had undergone CT imaging4. Some
              34% of 101 cats with evidence of middle ear disease did
              not have a history of ear disease, suggesting subclinical
              otitis media. This suggests that the incidence of middle
              ear disease in cats may be higher than either the clinical
              signs, gross lesions or the literature suggests3,4.            B

              6.2 OTITIS MEDIA IN THE CAT

              Primary otitis media in cats is thought to be of viral
              origin. Feline upper respiratory viruses (calicivirus and
              herpesvirus) would be expected to play a major role in
              the aetiology of otitis media, but, to date, there has been
              no evidence supporting an infectious cause5,6. In most
              cases of primary otitis media in cats no obvious clinical
              signs are present until the infection spreads to the inner
              ear (see Chapter 5 Aetiology and Pathogenesis of Otitis
              Externa, Section 5.9 and Chapter 7 Diseases of the
              Inner Ear, Section 7.4). Sometimes Horner’s syndrome          Figs 6.3A, B Otoscopic view of a cat with otitis media and
              is seen. Upon otoscopy a red tympanic membrane can            interna (A), note the red discolouration of the pars tensa

              sinusitis. In the absence of protruding polyps and otitis
              interna, myringotomy can be performed and the otitis          polyps need to be removed surgically, and concurrent
              media can be treated as discussed for dogs (see Chapter       otitis media should be treated with a course of systemic
              6 Diseases of the Middle Ear, Section 6.3).                   antibiotics (see Chapter 6 Diseases of the Middle Ear,

              steatoma revealed that surgical approach (VBO versus
              TECA–LBO) did not influence outcome and sug-
              gested that the surgeon can use whichever approach
              is most appropriate20. VBO may be preferable when
              the ear canal appears normal or mildly changed, but
              TECA–LBO has the additional advantage that no
              further migration of ear canal epithelium can occur and
              no further ear canal treatment is necessary. Recurrence
              rates after surgery are reportedly high (20–50%20,21),
              particularly if advanced disease is present, as indicated
              by an inability to open the jaw, neurological disease, or

              6.6 TRAUMA OF THE TEMPORAL BONE

              Trauma is a common cause of morbidity and death in
              dogs67–69. Though outcome of severe blunt trauma
              in dogs treated with intensive care is very good, head
              trauma and cranium fractures were significantly associ-
              ated with a negative outcome in two large studies70,71.
              Head trauma may result from many different events,
              including motor vehicle accidents, bites, falls, kicks or
              penetrating injuries such as gunshot wounds72,73. The
              most frequent cause of head trauma noted in small
              animals is motor vehicle trauma68,72. The pathophysiol-
              ogy of trauma to the head, especially involving the nose
              and nasal sinuses is discussed in Chapter 11 Diseases
              of the Nasal Cavity and Sinuses, Section 11.12. Less
              commonly the auricles, ear canals, temporal bones and             Fig. 6.18 Transverse CT image demonstrating a
              petrosal bones are involved. However, if fractures of the         fracture through the tympanic bulla with subsequent
              base of the skull are present, they are often accompa-            fluid (blood) accumulation within the bulla.
              nied by petrosal and/or temporal bone damage. Trauma
              of the auricles and ear canals is discussed in Chapter 4

              Destruction of surrounding bones (lacrimal, palatine
              and maxillary) has the greatest predictive value of nasal
              neoplasia29–32. An increasing severity of bone lysis is
              also associated with a greater likelihood of neoplastic
              disease. Radiographic signs consistent with a diagno-
              sis of non-destructive rhinitis are a lack of frontal sinus
              lesions and a lack of lucent foci in the nasal cavity32.
              The location of lesions within the nose, unilateral or
              bilateral distribution of lesions and involvement of
              teeth are weak predictors of diagnosis. Radiographic
              signs in cats are in general less specific and septal devi-
              ation and lysis are commonly seen with rhinitis33,34.

              Many different radiographic views are used to demon-

              The basic views are the lateral, dorsoventral or ventro-

              therapy is planned for nasal neoplasia, CT is preferred
              as it assists with accurate treatment planning29. There
              does not seem to be superiority of MRI over CT for
              diagnostic evaluation of other chronic nasal disease like
              aspergillosis in dogs41. Since costs associated with MRI
              are considerably higher when compared with CT, and
              image acquisition time is much more rapid with CT
              than with MRI, CT is preferable in most cases.

              rhinitis also demonstrate middle ear effusion in one
              study42. Whereas in cats with clinical signs of otitis
              interna MRI may be preferred to evaluate the inner ear
              and brainstem, for surgical treatment planning such as
              ventral bulla osteotomy, CT is more informative and
              therefore the technique of choice for evaluation of nasal
              disease in this species as well.

              10.2 DISEASES AFFECTING THE ROSTRAL
              NOSE BUT NOT THE NASAL PLANUM

              Deep pyoderma
              Deep pyoderma of the nose presents as a moderately
              pruritic, occasionally furunculotic, crusting dermatitis
              on the rostral face. The nasal planum is not affected
              (Fig. 10.3). Note that superficial pyoderma, which is
              characterised by follicular and interfollicular papules
              and pustules, is very uncommonly seen on the face. The
              major differential diagnoses are the pemphigus diseases,
              which usually affect the nasal planum and eosinophilic
              furunculosis, which is peracute in onset, much more
              pruritic and does not affect the nasal planum. Other           Fig. 10.3 Deep pyoderma on the nose of a Bull Terrier.
              considerations are demodicosis and dermatophytosis.            Crusted papules, furunculosis and mild pruritus.
                 Treatment is directed toward the primary differ-
              ential with systemic antibacterial therapy for 3 weeks
              and, perhaps, dilute chlorhexidine soaks, to soften the         A
              crust and exert topical antibacterial therapy. No ster-
              oids should be given as this will make assessment of the
              effect of antibacterial treatment impossible. Failure to
              respond should prompt biopsy for histopathological
              examination.

              Eosinophilic folliculitis and furunculosis
              Eosinophilic folliculitis is a peracute nasal dermatitis
              characterised by early and rapid progression from a
              papular pattern to a proliferative, highly pruritic, even
              painful, ulcerated plaque, or plaques (Figs 10.4A, B).
              Bloom and others4–6 have pointed out difficulties with
              this dermatosis being classified as pyoderma, based on
              a failure to respond to antibacterial treatment and the         B
              histopathological pattern. Bloom4 has also pointed out
              that if this disease is, indeed, an acute reaction to insect
              or arthropod bite and stings, as has been proposed, it
              might not be expected to occur in the winter months
              and might be anticipated to be more common than it
              appears to be. Currently, this must be considered an
              idiopathic dermatopathy.




              Figs 10.4A, B Figures 10.4A, B demonstrate the sever-

              Microsporon canis dermatophytosis
              Microsporon canis is a zoophilic dermatophyte7. It is the
              most frequent cause of dermatophytosis in the cat in the
              UK, Italy, southern United States and Brazil (reviewed
              by Bond7). M. canis is classically associated with patches
              of alopecia associated with fractured hair shafts, a fine
              scale and variable erythema (Fig. 10.5). It may be mildly
              pruritic. An inflammatory folliculitis may be seen occa-
              sionally. Lesions on the nasal planum appear to be very
              uncommon7 but lesions on the rostral face might be
              encountered occasionally. The management of M. canis
              dermatophytosis is discussed elsewhere.
                                                                           Fig. 10.5 Erythematous patch on the lateral nose of a

              dermatophytosis
              Microsporum gypseum is a geophilic dermatophyte,
              found in the soil, and it has been most commonly
              reported as a dermatophytic infection in dogs in the
              USA7. The other two are both zoophilic dermato-
              phytes, which are pathogens of free-living rodents. All
              three organisms tend to cause a much more inflamma-
              tory dermatitis than that seen in M. canis infections.
              Dogs are much more commonly infected than cats.
                 T. mentagrophytes and M. gypseum cause an inflam-
              matory folliculitis and furunculosis 8,9. The most
              commonly seen clinical signs are erythema, crusting,
              alopecia and pruritus. Lesions are usually well-demar-
              cated and commonly found on the face (Fig. 10.6).
              Partially-healed lesions may have a shiny appearance7.
              T. mentagrophytes infection is an uncommon cause of
              dermatitis in the southern USA (where M. gypseum
              dermatophytosis predominates), but is the second most        Fig. 10.6 Trichophyton mentagrophytes infection on the

              A slow, but gradual response was noted, although hair
              regrowth was poor. The oral regime18a was used in 10
              feline cases, four of which had cutaneous lesions, five
              cats had refractory ocular FHV-1 ulceration and one cat
              had chronic upper respiratory disease. All four cats with
              FHV-1 dermatitis had a favourable response, although
              one was treated by the owner with 5% acyclovir cream
              before entering the study. The authors considered that
              an initial dose of 62.5 mg q8h p/o would be an appro-
              priate starting dose. Patently, if the cat resists oral treat-
              ment then the parenteral regime would be necessary,
              notwithstanding.

                  Diagnosis is based on clinical signs of non-inflam-
              matory, normally pigmented, nasal hyperkeratosis that
              is limited to the nasal planum.
                  Treatment is non-specific and includes topical soaks
              with propylene glycol, petroleum jelly or a combination
              of 60% salicylic acid, 5% urea and 5% sodium lactate
              in a bland propylene glycol vehicle (such as Kerasolv,

              (in severe cases)30,31.

              Idiopathic nasodigital hyperkeratosis
              In contrast to idiopathic nasal hyperkeratosis where
              lesions are confined to the nasal planum, in this condition     B
              there is concurrent hyperkeratosis of the footpads. Note
              that foot pad hyperkeratosis, without nasal involvement,
              has been recognised as familial in two breeds, Irish terrier
              and Dogues de Bordeaux32,33. There is no evidence that
              nasodigital hyperkeratosis is familial, although the suspi-
              cion remains that it might be in some instances.
                 The clinical signs are straightforward with com-
              pacted, often peripherally feathered, and occasionally
              superficially fissured footpads, in association with nasal
              hyperkeratosis. The nasal hyperkeratosis is not as regu-
              larly fissured as that seen in idiopathic nasal hyperkera-
              tosis of old dogs.

                  Although the condition may be suspected, definitive
              diagnosis must be confirmed by histopathological exam-
              ination of biopsy samples42–44. The use of a 4 mm biopsy
              punch, taken with the dog under general anaesthesia, is
              ideal as the small residual wound is easy to close with a
              little tissue glue, or even digital pressure – no suture is
              usually necessary.

                antibacterial treatment during immunosuppressive

              Familial canine dermatomyositis
              Familial dermatomyositis is an inflammatory disease of
              the skin and muscles92. Certain breeds are predisposed,
              particularly the Shetland Sheepdog, Rough Collie and
              Beauceron93,94,94a. Although it has been reported occa-
              sionally in individuals of other breeds or familial clus-
              ters94a, it is not known if the condition is hereditary in
              these94a,95.
                  The condition occurs at any age, and has been
              reported, in some cases before 12 weeks of age92. There
              is no sex predisposition. The clinical signs are very vari-
              able, as is the course of the disease. In a few individu-
              als the number of lesions is low, they resolve quickly
              and patchy alopecia is the only consequence. In others,
              the majority, it is a very severe problem with erosions,
              crusts, ulcerations and scarring.
                  The inner surfaces of the pinnae, the face (nose,
              planum nasale and lips) (Figs 10.39, 10.40) tip of the
              tail and the distal limbs (including, and distal to, the
              elbow and stifle) are affected early on in the course of
              the disease with erythema, alopecia scale, crust and
              ulceration. Occasionally there may be vesicles, papules
              and pustules. In most individuals the acute phase slowly
              resolves over several weeks but there may be patchy
              scarring and alopecia with patchy depigmentation
              of the face, lips and nasal planum92,94. The myositis
              usually becomes evident several weeks after the onset
              of dermatological signs, in some cases after the derma-
              tological lesions have begun to regress. The severity of
              the myositis correlates with the severity of the derma-
              tological lesions95, and particularly affects the temporal
              and limb muscles.
                  Diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical signs and       Figs 10.39, 10.40 Typical facial lesions of familial

              samples is not usually necessary if the definitive diagno-
              sis has already been made.
                  Initial treatment is aimed at assessing the severity
              and probable time course as mildly affected animals
              may need no treatment95. Severely affected dogs may
              require euthanasia. Lesions are aggravated by exposure
              to strong sunlight and local trauma95.
                  Dogs that are judged in need of treatment do show
              a fair response to oral glucocorticoids but the doses
              required are high (immunosuppressive doses of 1–2
              mg/kg daily). Pentoxifylline (25 mg/kg twice daily) has
              shown to be of benefit in some of these animals95,96.
              Four of ten dogs in the study96 showed a complete clini-
              cal recovery while the other six showed some response.
              Most dogs fail to respond completely and many are
              maintained on pentoxifylline, perhaps with the addition
              of omega 3 fatty acids and intermittent glucocorticoids.

              Management
              Brachycephalic animals are gaining in popularity and
              during the recent decades, the severity of symptoms
              associated with this malformation has increased26–28.
              As Gerhard Oechtering stated: “Brachycephaly is a
              manmade disease”29. It is therefore up to us to fix it,
              since we have not only brought respiratory distress and
              exercise intolerance to these animals by excessively
              reducing the muzzle, but hearing loss and second-
              ary gastrointestinal abnormalities as well. In addition,
              since the nose plays a vital role in thermoregulation, it
              is probable that the heat-related disorders often seen in
              the affected breeds are caused by restricted temperature
              regulation as a result of the nasal obstruction29. Their
              sense of smell is also mostly like reduced.
                  Owners unfortunately are not aware of the severity
              and implications of these breed-specific problems26–28.      Fig. 11.8 Spaniel with severe epistaxis.

                  Direct visualisation with rhinoscopy is a particularly
              valuable diagnostic tool because the fungus destroys
              turbinate tissue leaving a large airspace within the nasal

                 In children, there is a high incidence of middle ear
              effusions with congenital cleft palates125. The effu-            A
              sions are considered to occur as a result of auditory
              tube dysfunction and/or obstruction leading to the
              accumulation of mucin-containing fluid and granula-
              tion tissue within the affected middle ear126. The con-
              dition may lead to conductive deafness, cholesteatoma
              formation, acute infections and sensorineural deaf-
              ness119,126. An association between congenital palatine
              defects and middle ear disease has been demonstrated
              both in the dog and in the cat120. In one study all six
              dogs described with soft palate hypoplasia exhibited
              an abnormal appearance of the middle ear cavities on
              radiographs (usually small, indistinct bullae with thick         B
              walls), though middle ear effusion and hearing loss as
              measured with brainstem evoked response audiometry
              was only present in one ear119. Techniques for surgical
              closure of hard and soft palate defects will be discussed

              11.8 POLYPS AND NEOPLASTIC DISEASE

              Benign lesions such as polyps, fibromas, intranasally
              dermoid cysts130, angiomatous proliferations, nasal
              angiofibroma131 and, most recently, an inflammatory
              myofibroblastic tumour132 have been reported in dogs,
              but most tumours of the nasal cavity in dogs are malig-
              nant133. Clinical signs are similar to those of nasosinal
              neoplasia (see below). The diagnosis is based on histo-
              pathological examination of representative nasal biop-
              sies. The prognosis after surgical resection of benign
              proliferations via dorsal rhinotomy is usually good.
                 Inflammatory polyps of the nasal turbinates have
              been described as a rare, benign disease of the nasal
              passages of young cats134. Cats with nasal polyps are
              usually younger than 1 year old, and are presented with
              epistaxis, paroxysmal sneezing and stertorous breath-       Fig. 11.17 Histopathological cross-sectional view of a

              the upper respiratory tract (URT) disease progresses,
              bacterial infection may become a relevant component
              of the problem. Typical isolates include Pasteurella spp.,
              Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Escherichia coli,
              Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp. and Corynebacterium
              spp.34,192,201. Johnson et al. demonstrated that both
              Mycoplasma spp. and other potentially pathogenic bac-
              teria (such as those detailed above) were isolated signifi-
              cantly more frequently from the noses of affected cats
              than from the noses of controls192. In contrast, the rate
              of detection of feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) DNA was
              not significantly different between groups.
                 Factors such as facial conformation (Persian type),
              vaccine status, frequent replacement of animals and
              mean age (especially in a cattery or shelter accommo-
              dation, see Gourkow et al.199), comorbidity (FeLV, FIV,        Fig. 11.19 Bilateral serous nasal discharge in a cat with
              chronic renal disease etc.), stress (social, visitors, reno-   FHV-1 infection.
              vations, travel etc.), the effect of ongoing pathology and
              secondary infection and nutritional status can all affect
              the progression, frequency of relapse and prognosis.

              Initiating, primary pathogens
              Feline herpesvirus-1
              Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) is a host-specific path-
              ogen of cats, entering and lysing URT epithelial
              cells202,203. Subsequent to the epithelial necrosis an
              inflammatory reaction ensues and an immune response
              is mounted203. The host’s immune response is compro-
              mised by two factors:
              • Incomplete immunity results in the possibility of,
                  generally less severe, reinfection.
              • Integration of viral genome in the nuclei of
                  sensory nerves permits the latent virus to be
                  reactivated, resulting in recrudescence of disease.        Fig. 11.20 Bilateral conjunctivitis.

              Diseases of the nasopharynx have been reported in dogs,
              but are more common in cats1–3. In dogs, diseases of the
              nasopharynx are often an extension of diseases of the
              nose (for example rhinitis, brachycephalic obstructive
              airway syndrome and neoplastic disease), though spe-
              cific nasopharyngeal abnormalities can be found as well.
              Cats are often afflicted with primary nasopharyngeal
              disease. Foreign bodies4–7 (Figs 12.1A–C), neoplastic
              disease1,3,8–11(Fig. 12.2), inflammatory polyps1,3,12–18,
              fungal granulomas19,20, cysts21–23 and choanal atresia or
              nasopharyngeal stenosis24–28 are encountered as causes
              of nasopharyngeal symptoms in dogs and cats. The
              middle ears and nasopharynx are commonly inflamed

                  Several treatment strategies for nasopharyngeal
              stenosis have been described, from open resection,
              balloon dilatation to nasopharyngeal stenting. Succes-
              ful surgical resection of the stenotic membrane has been
              reported27,36,38; however, (partial) restenosis after surgi-
              cal correction is a common complication27,39. Resteno-
              sis as a result of web formation may be prevented by
              accurate mucosal apposition using local mucosal flaps
              after resection of the area of the stenosis18,36. Mitomy-

              atresia40 (see below), but there are no veterinary reports
              available on topical adjunctive treatment. The use of a
              stent to augment a surgical revision was successful in
              one animal39.

              Oral fibrosarcoma tends to occur in large breed dogs
              (particularly Golden and Labrador Retrievers) at a
              younger age, with a median of 7.3–8.6 years and with a
              possible male predisposition36,37,49,78,86,132. Oral fibro-
              sarcoma, especially on the hard palate (Fig. 15.19) and
              maxillary arcade between the canine and carnassial
              teeth, will often look benign histologically, but behaves
              biologically very malignantly34,132. Treatment should
              be locally aggressive therefore, as this type of fibrosar-
              coma is locally invasive but metastasises to the lungs
              and occasionally regional lymph nodes in less than 30%
              of dogs38,39,78,86,97,98,110.

                 A laryngeal abscess is sometimes found in cats (Figs
              16.8A, B), possibly caused by penetration of the mucosa
              by a sharp bone, needle or other foreign body, giving
              entry to oral micro-organisms2,26. Clinical signs consist
              of slowly progressive dyspnoea and laryngeal stridor.
              Abscesses can usually be recognised on radiographs2
              or ultrasonographic imaging19,22,31,39,56 of the larynx.

                 plasmacytomas carry a good prognosis, but other
                 tumour types usually have a very poor prognosis.
               • In cats, malignant lymphoma is not uncommonly
                 found and should be differentiated from squamous
                 cell carcinoma as prognosis is very different for both
                 neoplasms.
               • Surgical resection via partial laryngectomy is possible
                 in some cases, whereas while complete laryngectomy
                 is technically feasible, it is not commonly used.

              RETROVERSION

              Epiglottic disorders are rare in dogs and cats. Partial
              obstruction of the rima glottis by displaced folds of the
              glosso-epiglottic mucosa has been described though as
              part of the laryngeal abnormalities commonly seen in
              brachycephalic breeds2,117. The diagnosis and importance
              of the condition remain both difficult and controver-

              tis is not seen as a consequence of this displacement9,118.
              Apparent epiglottic entrapment was reported in five other
              dogs that were presented for coughing, gagging, dyspnoea
              and collapse2,119. In that report, the rostral third of the epi-
              glottis was amputated, and redundant ventral mucosa was            Fig. 16.12 Yorkshire Terrier with epiglottic retroversion.

              In most cases bandages are applied to deal with a combi-

              of the head, either due to long cranially tapering noses

              The local area can be protected from automutilation by

                 Bandages are also not recommended after throat
              surgery, as they either usually slip or are applied too
              tight, which can result in obstruction of venous and

              This bandage should be changed daily to remove any

              Aural haematoma is a common condition of the canine
              and feline pinna. Dog breeds with pendulous ears are
              more commonly affected24. Aural haematoma results
              from bleeding within the cartilage layers of the auricle
              or cartilage and perichondrium, and is characterised by a
              fluctuating mass between the concave and convex sides of
              the auricle1,17,24,25. The exact cause is unknown, but it has
              been thought to occur following trauma secondary to head
              shaking in otitis externa, which leads to bleeding within
              the cartilage or cartilage and perichondrium, leading in
              turn to vessel rupture, haemorrhage and aural haematoma
              formation5,24–26. However, not all cases reported have con-
              current otitis externa5,24–26. An autoimmune pathogenesis
              was suggested by Kuwahara et al.1, but proved to be very
              unlikely by Joyce and Day27. The diagnosis is based on the
              clinical appearance of the heavy auricle, bulging on the
              concave side (Fig. 18.1), and the absence of clinical signs of   Fig. 18.1 A large aural haematoma of the entire left

              • After surgical preparation of the entire auricle and
                draping of the patient, the haematoma is opened
                on the concave side on the most distal aspect
                of the haematoma with a stab incision through
                both skin and cartilage using a Bard-Parker
                scalpel handle with No. 11 blade (Fig. 18.2) until
                the serohaemorrhagic fluid escapes and can be
                suctioned34.
              • The incision is enlarged in the shape of an S over
                the entire haematoma to avoid folding of the
                auricle during the healing process and blood clots
                and fibrin are removed17.
              • With gentle use of a curette, fibroangioblastic
                tissue is removed from the inner surface of the
                cartilage without causing additional bleeding (Figs
                18.3A, B).
              • After irrigation of the cavity, interrupted mattress
                sutures are placed through all layers of the auricle

              the mandible to the level of the atlas (A). The incision is deepened by blunt dissection between digastricus muscle
              and hypoglossal and styloglossal muscles until the bulla can be palpated (B). A small incision can be made over
              the bulla periosteum (C). A Steinmann pin can be used to make a hole on the ventral aspect (D), and the opening
              can be enlarged with a small rongeur or Kerrison punch (E). Material is collected from the large ventral compart-
              ment for culture, sensitivity testing, cytology and histopathology (F, G). The bony septum separating the ventral
              cavity from the dorsolateral compartment can be identified and opened with a small osteotome, Steinmann pin
              or Kerrison punches (H). After cleaning and flushing the dorsolateral compartment, a Penrose drain is placed (I).
              Subcutaneous tissues and skin are closed routinely (J).

                               Primary secretory otitis media (PSOM) or OME is
                               an increasingly recognised disease of unknown aeti-
                               opathogenesis that predominantly affects Cavalier
                               King Charles Spaniels80–83 and can cause hearing loss.
                               auditory tube dysfunction is most likely the primary
                               factor leading to decreased drainage of the mucus from
                               the middle ear (see Chapter 5 Aetiology and Pathogen-
                               esis of Otitis Externa, Section 5.4). Described methods
                               of treatment consist of either multiple myringotomies,
              I                or placement of tympanostomy tubes for more con-
                               tinual tympanic cavity ventilation and drainage22,79,84.
                               Bobbin-reuter type tympanostomy tubes can either
                               be placed with the use of an operating microscope or
                               under endoscopic guidance. Tympanostomy tube inser-
                               tion so far has only been evaluated in three dogs under
                               direct visualisation of the tympanic membrane with
                               an operating microscope through an otic speculum22.
                               Though the authors reported the technique to be easy
                               to perform in a short amount of time, endoscopic place-
                               ment22a is certainly less complicated and less cumber-

              J                this technique, which is described below.

              aspiration pneumonia or if gastroesophageal reflux             C
              is suspected. In humans a correlation between cri-
              copharyngeal achalasia and gastroesophageal reflux has
              been found26. Following cricopharyngeal myotomy or
              myectomy gastroesophageal reflux may be increased26.
              Prokinetic agents (metoclopramide) combined with
              decreasing gastric acidity with H-2 blockers and sucral-
              fate for reflux oesophagitis are recommended22,26.
                 With respect to postoperative nutritional support,
              soft food for 1–2 days after surgery and slow return to
              normal food over the next 2–3 weeks is recommended.
              With resolution of the achalasia, dogs should be able          D

              Figs 20.6A–H The animal is in dorsal recumbency, with
              the head towards the right side of the images. A paramedian skin incision is made on the left side with blunt
              dissection through subcutis lateral to the sternohyoid and sternocephalic muscles (A) until the dorsal edge of the
              thyroid can be palpated and lifted (B). An incision is made in the thyropharyngeal muscle along the dorsolateral
              edge of the thyroid (C). After opening the larynx, the dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle and muscular process of the
              arytenoid can be identified (D, Allis forceps on dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle). The cricoarytenoid articulation
              is now disarticulated (E) and the arytenoid is dissected free. Two synthetic nonabsorbable sutures are placed
              through the muscular process of the arytenoid to the most caudodorsal part of the thyroid to lateralise the
              arytenoid (F) and tied (G). After the tieback, the thyropharyngeal muscle can be apposed with a simple continuous
              pattern with absorbable material (H); closure of subcutaneous tissue and skin is routine.

              A midline cricothyroidotomy is performed to expose
              the vocal folds (C). A large benign mass is tagged to aid
              in dissection (D) and exteriorised (E) before complete
              resection. The resulting defect is closed by apposing
              the mucosa in a simple interrupted appositional pattern
              (F). For closure, the thyroid cartilage and cricothyroid
              ligament are apposed with simple interrupted sutures (G).

    O traçado eletrocardiográfico é uma linguagem que
    mostra como está a atividade elétrica do coração.
    O nó sinusal acima do átrio direito é responsável por
    formar o estimulo elétrico e mandar para todo o coração
    para que se contraia.
    Saindo do nó sinusal temos outros feixes chamados de vias
    internodais que levam para o átrio esquerdo e átrio direito
    o estímulo.
    Ao chegar no nó atrioventricular teremos um retardo do
    estímulo elétrico para depois mandar através do feixe de
    His atingindo todo os dois ventrículos.

    The CAUTIOUS CANINE
                                 How to Help Dogs Conquer Their Fears
                                    by Patricia B. McConnell, Ph.D.




D oes Fido’s barking at visitors make you a little nervous?
           Does Queenie run into the closet when you turn on the vacuum or cower when trucks pass
by? Has your dog ever growled while you were out walking when someone tried to pet her? All of these
behavioral problems are often symptoms of a dog who is afraid of someone or something. This booklet is
for people who own and love a dog who has a behavioral problem that is motivated by fear. Some fearful
dogs simply run and hide, but others can act out on their fears and cause harm. This program is designed
to prevent that.
The method described here, classical counter conditioning, is a universally effective treatment for fear-
based behavioral problems. This method can help many animals get over their fears, so you can use this
booklet if your dog is afraid of the vet or a ceiling fan, if your cat is afraid of another cat, or even for
yourself. (I used it myself to help get over a fear of public speaking! ) To illustrate the method in detail,
this booklet describes a treatment program for dogs who are afraid of unfamiliar people. If you want to
use this program to treat some other fear, just substitute the relevant problem and go from there.
Will this program help any dog? This program won’t help dogs if their behavior is not motivated, at
least in part, by fear. There are many reasons why dogs don’t act the way we want them to around
strangers, so be sure to have an accurate diagnosis before you proceed. If your dog has nipped or bitten,
it is essential that you first do short-term management by preventing any more occurences, and that you
begin a program with a certified applied animal behaviorist, experienced trainer or board-certified
veterinary specialist in behavior. This program also won’t help you if you don’t have the time to work on
it. I want to be clear at the outset that following this program to the letter takes a commitment of time
and energy — how much time and energy depends on the severity of the problem. The bad news is that
it might take up to a year to truly re-condition your dog. The good news is that it’s easy to do once you
get the hang of it.
What following this program can achieve: This program can significantly change your dog’s behavior if
his misbehavior is motivated by fear. Following the steps in this booldet will help many dogs lose their
fear of strangers and stop barking, cowering, hiding, growling, and in some cases, even snapping or
biting. Imagine what it would be like to have a dog who happily wags his tail when the doorbell rings!
Won’t it be great when King tail wags benevolently at the painter, instead of growling at him from
behind your legs while the painter calls his lawyer on a cell phone? Imagine confidently walking down
the street and smiling when people ask “may I pet your dog” (or, more likely, when they don’t ask at
all!). No one can guarantee that all dogs will be successfully treated by any program, including this one,
but the behavior of many dogs will improve if you follow the guidelines within this booldet. Just keep in



                                                      1
mind that every dog is different and has a different potential for successful treatment.
Will this program ruin my dog as a “guard dog?” I sure hope so. Barking dogs can be a great deterrent
to criminals, but a dog who is aggressive to visitors is like a loaded gun on your coffee table. It’s true that
your “guard dog” might bite a burglar and chase him away, but he’s just as likely to bite your neighbor,
your electrician, or the paramedics who come when you call 911. It’s not fair to expect your dog to be
able to distinquish between all the subtleties of human comings and goings, nor is it fair to have a dog
living in fear of strangers all his life. I believe that if your dog has it in him to defend you in times of
physical danger then he will, no matter how much he loves the UPS man.
The Goal of the Program:         Right now your dog is anxious, for
whatever reason, about greeting strangers. This program is designed to change his or her response to
unfamiliar people from one of fear to one of relaxed happiness. Rather than thinking “Oh NO! Who’s
that?! What should I do?!,” I want your dog to see an approaching person and think “Oh boy! Way cool!
Here comes someone I’ve never met! Yippee skipee!” (Okay, maybe that’s a bit much lor a reserved
Akita, but you get the idea!)
This program is different than “obedience training.” In traditional obedience training you are asking a
dog to perform an action, like Lie Down, Sit or Stay. When you teach a dog to overcome stranger anxiety,
you learn to control a dog’s emotions. After all, it’s his internal state — how he’s feeling inside — that
drives his behavior. Dogs are very much like humans, in the sense that sometimes their emotions can get
in the way of their performance. They can’t “just stop barking” because you told them to anymore than
we can ignore our fear of public speaking and perform perfecdy in front of an audience just because we
“should!” Following the steps below addresses the cause of his problem behavior — his emotions —
rather than just treating the symptoms.



STEP ONE: MAKE IT SAFE
First sit down and write out what you need to do to insure that your dog can’t possibly hurt anyone
while you are following this program. This is not just for the sake of public safety, although that’s
certainly enough of a motivation. Avoiding trouble is also imperative for your dog’s successful
treatment. If your dog nips someone out of fear while you are teaching him to overcome his anxiety, it
will be even harder for both of you to be relaxed around other people again. As you are teaching your
dog a new response to strangers you must set up situations where the old fearful response either doesn’t
occur, or occurs at such a low level that you can easily change your dog’s emotional state. This is as
important for your emotional state as it is for your dog’s. Dogs are brilliant at reading tension in their
owners, and if you are nervous, your dog will pick up on it. Only you know your dog, but here are some
general tips that help a lot of dog owners:


1. Physically prevent contact between your dog and unfamiliar people when you can’t
   manage the interaction in a SAFE and RELAXED manner.
For example, say you’re in a hurry, it’s the UPS man at the door (who hates dogs, and vice versa) and it’s


                                                      2
really not the time lor .1 mellow training session. Grabbing your dog by the collar while anxiously yelling
“Sit! NO! Duke, Sit Down!” is teaching Duke to be even more anxious about visitors. You are better off to
avoid this situation by teaching your dog to go into another room, behind a closed door or sturdy gate,
before you open the front door to visitors.
Here’s how you do it: Start by training this when it’s quiet, with no visitors and no distractions. While
you and the dog are standing beside the front door, give the dog some signal, like “go to your place” and
happily trot with him away from the front door into a back room. Then throw a treat or a toy stuffed
with treats on the floor for the dog, shut the door for a just a few seconds, and then let him out. Repeat
this until he’s busily slurping up treats in the back room while you open the front door and pretend that
there are visitors there. Eventually, practice with friends or family ringing the bell and entering the house
until your dog willingly complies by going to his “place” when “real” visitors come.
If, by the way, you have problems with your dog at the door and you have other dogs, you are better off
to work with just one dog at a time. Barking is contagious, and another dog can increase the arousal level
of your trainee, so put your other dogs away when you are first working through the program.


2. Avoid cro^vded areas on walks.
If someone looks like they might come too close (“too close” is defined by your dog), simply walk to the
other side of the street. If you can’t do that, then be sure you always have treats or special toys that are
guaranteed to distract your dog. Distract her by feeding her treats or a tossing ball up and down. Try
speaking to her in a relaxed tone (Singing “Happy Birthday” works for me. Hard to be nervous when
you’re singing foolish songs!). Keep your dog’s attention on you in a positive way while you move
purposefully away from the strangers.


3. Some people find it helpful to condition their doff to a muzzle.
If a dog is muzzled everyone can relax, which is in your dog’s best interests in the long run. However,
don’t just slap a muzzle on a fearful dog — that could just make things worse by scaring your dog and
making him even more fearful. When life is quiet, perhaps before dinner time, start a game where your
dog takes a tasty treat which is sitting inside a soft fabric muzzle. Don’t attempt to put the muzzle on her,
just let her get used to putting her nose toward the muzzle and getting a great treat when she does.
Gradually put the treat farther inside the muzzle so that she has to put her nose all the way through (by
now, you are holding the muzzle up in front of the dog’s nose) to get the treat. After a few sessions of
that, attach the muzzle behind her ears for just a few seconds as you keep feeding her treats through the
front. Over the days and weeks, occassionally leave the muzzle on for longer periods (no more than 5 or
10 minutes). Don’t let her paw it off. If she tries to, distract her with your voice or by holding treats by
her nose. Then let her have the treat when she’s been quiet for a bit. Use the muzzle in contexts where
you can’t control all the actors, but neither can you isolate the dog. Muzzles seem offensive to many
people, but they can prevent the very tension that precipitates an aggressive incident. Don’t worry that
this will give your dog a “bad reputation.” It’s just your way of helping him — and you — relax.




                                                     3
4. Here’s what DOESN’T work:
Standing beside your dog, holding him with your hands or pulling tightly on the leash while strangers
approach him or try to pet him. Even if “nothing happens,” your dog may be more scared of strangers
the next time because he was trapped into an aversive situation. We humans tend to have a fantasy that
if we’re “right there” we can somehow prevent trouble. Take it on faith from me: you can’t. Dogs are
faster than humans, a lot faster. Your chance of preventing a bite by matching your reaction time to your
dog’s is zero, so don’t get your dog in a situation where you think he might be not be safe. Your job is to
prevent those situations. Do that by setting up controlled interactions where you control how close others
are to your dog — we’ll talk about the details of how to do that below.
STEP TWO: WHAT SCARES YOUR DOG?
The second step is to sit down and figure out exactly what elicits the problem behavior. Sometimes what
scares your dog is very general, like anyone unfamiliar who comes to the door or anyone who reaches
quickly toward the dog and tries to pet him on the top of his head. However, what scares your dog can
be extremely specific —like the dog I just saw who, after being friendly for four years, began barking
aggressively at teenage boys with baseball caps. In this case, there was reason to believe that the dog had
learned to be afraid of a particular boy with a cap on, and that he had generalized this fear to all boys
with hats.
Most “shy” dogs are not afraid because of some abusive incident, but because they are genetically
predisposed to be afraid of unfamiliar things. Some new things are scarier than others. Shy dogs most
commonly are afraid of: unfamiliar people; men more often than women (especially large, deep voiced
guys); people with funny looking silouettes (carrying bags, wearing hats, etc.); people who charge up to
them; hands that reach over the top of their heads; young children who move and speak erratically, and
people who are themselves afraid of dogs.
Be Specific! It’s very helpful to sit down and make a specific list of the things that upset your dog. Be
sure the entire family participates, because dogs behave differently with different people. The key to
being specific is to understand that behavior is measured in microseconds and micrometers. An
outstreched hand might elicit fear in your dog if it moves moderately quickly to within 12 inches of the
dog’s face, but not if it’s moved slowly. The same outstreched hand might not scare your dog if it moves
quickly toward your dog, but stops at 24 inches instead of 12 inches from his face. It’s important to be
aware of what exactly sets your dog off, because we need to start working with those same events at an
intensity level below that which frightens him. We’ll call the events that scare your dog TRIGGERS, or “the
bad,” since it is what your dog considers to be “bad,” whether it’s the approach of a big man with a hat
on or a little girl on a bicycle. The more specific and thorough your list of triggers, the better chance you’ll
have of successfully treating your dog.
Specific triggers can become generalized: Do keep in mind that SPECIFIC events that initially set off a
dog can become generalized: perhaps the most common example is the dog who feels threatened when
delivery people come. It’s probably not the uniform that bothers him at first; more likely he learns that
people with uniforms are territorial intruders. After all, they barge in and dash out, never stopping to
perform a greeting ceremony like a polite dog would. Since delivery people always leave right after the
dog barks, the dog is reinforced for barking by the withdrawal of what makes him anxious — the


                                                      4
intruder. After months or years of this, dogs begin to generalize: people with uniforms are territorial
intruders who are best dealt with by aggressive barking.
One event can include many triggers: Imagine someone comes to the door and rings the bell. That single
event well might contain multiple triggers that your dog responds to. If your dog gets agitated when
visitors come, experiment to see what parts of the event add to her reaction. For example, after a few
months of associating the bell with a stranger coming into the house, many dogs begin to respond just to
the sound of the doorbell by itself. The bell becomes the “trigger” that sets the dog off and elicits fear and
arousal, even if there are no visitors outside. Triggers in our “visitor to the house” example could
include: the bell ringing or someone knocking, you walking to the front door, you opening the door, your
dog seeing someone standing in front of the door, a person stepping over the threshold and entering the
house, a person speaking to your dog or reaching toward it. Once you know all the probable triggers that
your dog reacts to, you can set up situations where you seperate them out so you can work on them one
at a time. If your dog has only a mild or moderate fear of strangers, you probably don’t need to work on
each and every trigger seperately, but if your dog is extremely scared, or at risk of causing an injury, you
must start by separating out each “bad” thing that scares your dog.
STEP THREE: FIND FIDO’S PASSIONS
Now you want to sit down and write out a list of what your dog loves. Note I said LOVES. You need to
find something that your dog is passionate about, that she’ll do just about anything for, AND that you
can give to her in small units repeatedly over and over again. Food works well for many dogs because so
many dogs love tasty' treats, and because it’s easy to chop food up into little pieces. When I say “tasty” I
don’t mean dry kibble or grain-based dog treats. I mean something your dog goes crazy over. My dogs
enjoy just about any doggie treats, but they think meat was made in heaven, so that’s what I use if I want
to teach my dog a new trick. Meat- based products seem to get the most dogs’ attention, but all dogs are
different. Do your own choice tests and see if your dog gets electric over chicken, liver, hot dogs or, bless
them, frozen peas. The right food can make all the difference. I see owners every week who say: “Oh, my
dog isn’t all that excited about food” while Fido is drooling buckets at my feet and turning somersaults
because I ignored the dry doggie bones and got out my chicken.
Some Cautions About Using Food. If you are working with your dog often, you might need to cut down
on his dinner. If your dog really loves his kibble, just use part of his dinner for the training. If you use
treats instead of dinner kibble (which will be 95% of dog owners), decrease his dinner by 5 or 10 percent.
I’d rather your dog gained a pound or two than bite your neighbor, but I don’t want your dog blimping
out so that you end up with a health problem. You can also compensate for the extra food by adding
more exercise to your dog’s day — lots of exercise is extremely valuable for fearful dogs anyway, so it’s
well worth your time.
If your dog loves tasty treats, but won’t eat during a training session, then you are going too far, too fast.
Anxiety supresses appetite, so if your dog refuses his favorite food, then you will know that you must
rearrange things logistically so that he is more relaxed.
Food Isn’t the Way to Every Dog’s Heart. If you have an obsessive retrieving dog, then you can use
tennis balls just as easily as food. Sometimes play is even more effective than food, since it‘s hard to be



                                                     5
playful and nervous at the same time. Some dogs have no interest in objects like balls, but go crazy over
squeaky toys. Spend time figuring out what your dog adores and what she is willing to work for. That
will be the key to changing your dog’s reactions to strangers. Every dog is different, so find your dog’s
personal passion that you can dole out repeatedly, and then proceed to the next step. No matter what
that passion might be, we’ll call it the TREAT or the “good,” since we know that your dog loves it, and it
has the power to make your dog feel good inside.




STEP FOUR: LINKING UP THE “GOOD” AND THE
“BAD”
Now you are ready to put all of the steps together: you’ve insured safety, you know EXACTLY what sets
your dogs off (the trigger) and you know what your dog adores (the treat). The basis of treatment is to
introduce the dog to a very low intensity of the trigger (so that he’s not really scared yet) while he’s
getting a very high intensity of the treat that he loves. Always remember that you are teaching your dog
a new response to a stranger (“Oh boy, who’s that?”). In order to do that you need to avoid situations
where the old response comes out before you can influence the dog (“Oh no, ON GUARD, stranger
coming!”). You do this by keeping the intensity of the trigger very low. For example, a low intensity
trigger might occur when you are out on a walk with your dog and a person approaches from a hundred
yards away. A high intensity treat might be a piece of hot dog held right beside his nose.
Let’s take the example above and expand on it. Say you’ve determined that your dog is afraid of
unfamiliar people while you’re out walking together in the neighborhood. You’ve noticed that he ignores
people 50 yards away, begins to look tense when they are 20 yards away, tries to go behind you if they’re
10 yards away, and has snapped twice on walks when people tried to pet him and he couldn’t get away.
If you give your dog a treat when the stranger is 20 yards away (and he’s already looking tense), you
may not teach him to feel good about strangers. So, at first you want to give your dog a treat right after he
sees people 50 yards away. It might seem like a waste of time to give your dog treats (or play ball, etc.) in
situations where you know your dog is really “fine,” but this is the key to helping your dog: starting
when you can insure that your dog associates feeling extra- good with seeing unfamiliar people. For most
fearful dogs, that will only happen if the stranger is at a distance.
Right after your dog gets the treat, change your walk such that the distance between you and the strangers
increases. You might have to turn around and walk the other way, or go across the street (you might have
been doing this anyway, but at least now it’s part of a plan!). If they just get closer and closer your dog
might end up getting scared again, and you’ve lost the opportunity to create a new association.
Obviously these events need to take place where you have a lot of control over how close you are to
other people. Avoid crowded places where you and your dog might get blindsided (I’ll talk later about
what to do when that happens though, life being what it is!).
A helpful way to think of this part of the plan is that you are training your dog’s emotions, just as you
have previously spent time training your dog’s actions. Right now we are primarily interested in


                                                     6
influencing your dog’s thoughts and emotions, so don’t pay much attention to whether your dog is
sitting or standing, as long as he looks relaxed.
You can see now why it’s so important to be aware of all the things that set your dog off. If your dog
flinches when someone reaches toward her, start giving her treats when the person is 20 feet away, long
before she’d get scared by any movement from the stranger. If your dog is afraid of the vet, thext drive to
the clinic parking lot, stuff Ginger’s mouth with hot dogs and then drive away without even getting out!
If your dog is getting increasingly agitated when people come to the door, start by tossing ti'eats or toys
just after a family member rings the bell. Keep up the treats when you open the door, but now the “visitor”
(one of your dog’s best human buddies) should toss the goodies. It might seem silly to have someone the
dog already adores go through this process, but it’s actually critical to the success of the program. You
are laying a foundation of associations (doorbell rings and YES! I get happy!) that will be essential later
on, when real strangers appear at the door.
In summary, the first stage of treatment is to teach your dog an association betweexr something that
could scare them if it was more intense (if it was faster, closer, bigger, etc.) and something that you




                                                    7
know the dog adores. You do this by insuring that you have at least
some control over the triggers, and are well stocked with your dog’s
favorite treats.
How much of this do I have to do? The key to getting this to work is to
create events, over and over again, where your dog learns to associate
feeling great with a low intensity version of what scares him. The
number of repetitions needed varies tremendously from one dog to
another, depending on many factors. The degree of shyness of the dog
(mediated both by genetics and early experience), whether your dog is
an “alpha-wannabee,” the number of exposures per week, and your skill
and timing are probably the most important factors. Minor cases can
require only a few sessions at this level and then you and your dog can
move on. However, I’ve had clients who’s dogs needed hundreds of
repetitions over many months before we could even consider the next
step. In general, the amount of time necessary correlates with the degree
and duration of the problem. But every dog is different. Always be
conservative, and err on the side of safety. There’s nothing to lose by
being cautious, and what’s a few more weeks or months of training
compared to many years of a happy and safe life for your dog?
Don’t go beyond this stage until your dog clearly begins to anticipate
something good happening when he sees a stranger at your pre-
determined distance. For instance, King might see someone coming
down the street and look at you and wag his tail. Maggie might try to
get the tennis ball out of your pocket. Once you get this kind of
response, continue with this phase for several more sessions before
moving on, just to insure that the new response is truly learned. Keep in
mind that a response in one context doesn’t always generalize to
another. If Maggie is doing really well in a familiar neighborhood park,
then move on to the next step whenever you are there. But don’t assume
her behavior will be consistent in another environment, like at the vet
clinic. Always be ready to back up a step when you change contexts.
What’s critical at this stage is to condition your dog that big guys with
uniforms (or whatever it was that scared your dog) are a signal that
something really wonderful is about to happen. If the “good thing”—say
it’s a tennis ball—consistently comes right after the UPS man, then
bingo! you’ve just conditioned an association between the UPS man and
the ball. After you do it enough,




                                  I
                                  I
your dog’s response to the UPS man will become the same as his
response to a tennis ball. That’s why classical conditioning is so
powerful — it’s as though your delivery man becomes a huge walking
tennis ball to your dog, because he evokes the exact same response.



STEP FIVE: INCREASE THE
INTENSITY OF THE TRIGGER
The next stage of treatment is to gradually increase the intensity level of
whatever scares your dog. Always keep the intensity of the “good” as
high as you can, while you create situations step-by-step where the
trigger stimulus moves toward a moderate, and eventually high-level of
intensity. Say, for example, that your dog is nervous around strangers
while out walking, and you’ve gotten her extra happy and relaxed when
she sees someone at 50 yards. Now you should start allowing her to get
closer to strangers. How much closer always will depend on each dog,
but let’s say you’ve been giving Ginger treats when she sees people 50
yards away and it’s been going great. Now start giving her treats when
the person is about 40 yards away. Continue giving her treats until they
get to within, say, 30 yards. Avoid the person getting too close (in this
case closer than 30 yards), by moving you and your dog out of the
stranger’s path of travel before he or she gets any closer.
So it looks like this: you notice an approaching stranger, hopefully even
before Ginger does. Give Ginger several treats while the person is
between 30 and 40 yards away. Then, at 40 yards from the stranger,
change direction so that he or she doesn’t get too close and thus elicit the
old fearful reaction that you want to avoid. Drop out the treats as the
distance between you and tire stranger increases so that your dog
associates approach with good things, and withdrawal "with no more
goodies.
Don’t consider the specific distances that I’ve used in this example as a
prescription: most dogs can handle being much closer to strangers than
40 yards. The distance that you choose depends on your dog, and how
fearful he is about approaching strangers.
If you somehow can’t avoid the stranger getting too close, keep tossing
the ball or stuffing treats into Ginger’s mouth, keeping her attention on
you with the treats. However, if she reverts to barking or to any of her
other old habits, firmly and quietly ask her to sit. If she won’t, stop
talking to her and swiftly turn her away from the problem until she is



                                    12
capable of calming down and sitting quietly. Once she’s capable of
sitting, speak quiedy and rub her chest widt circular strokes until she’s
even more calmed down. I’ll talk in more depth later about what to do
when things don’t go quite as planned.
Continue this process, giving your dog treats, or toys, or happy talk as
she sees people, and before she gets nervous. Do this as often as you can,
in as many contexts as you can. Remember that every time you change
contexts, you are, in a way, “starting over.” In each new situation, be
sure to back up and insure that the intensity of the trigger is below your
dog’s threshold. Many dogs are worse in their own neighborhoods,
presumably where they feel both threatened and/or responsible. In this
case, start by walking the dog in other neighborhoods, and gradually
work your way back to your own.
Have others start tossing the treat or the toy: Continue over the weeks
or months having people get closer and closer while your dog gets treats
as they approach. Once the people get close enough to do so, it’s time to
start asking them to toss the treat. Ask your dog-loving friends to help
you out and pretend to be a “stranger” approaching on the street. You
can also ask passers-by if they mig help, keeping in mind to always keep
safety first. Ask people whose faces look receptive, and avoid people
who look busy, who won’t make eye contact, or worse—who look afraid
of your dog. You give the treat whenever you can, and create situations
where others toss treats when you’re sure it will go well.
I played this game once with my dog, Lassie. I got her when she was one
year old and she seemed cautious about unfamiliar men, although she
wasn’t aggressive in any way. But since I knew that caution at one year
can sometimes turn into aggression when a dog is three years old, I
wanted to eliminate her cautiousness before I had a problem. I drove to a
nearby small town, and sat on a bench in front of the local cafe with a
bucket of cut up lamb. 1 was on the lookout for friendly men who got
one of those “what a cute dog” looks on their faces at 20 yards. If they
did, long before they got within petting distance I’d ask them if they’d
mind helping me out: “Lassie hasn’t met a lot of men, and I want her to
love guys, so would you throw these treats to her?” Note that I didn’t
have them feed her by hand yet, because I wanted Lassie to associate
approaching men with feeling great. A fast approach by an incoming
stranger and hand moving quickly toward her face, even to offer a treat,
might have scared her a little. I tossed treats to the stranger, so that he
could toss them to Lassie. This had the secondary advantage of keeping
his hands busy and preventing him from petting the dog before she was
ready for it! Sitting on a bench hustling men might seem intimidating,


                                   13
but eventually you have to find a way to have others throw the treats.
Just to be sure to be conservative and only set up situations you are sure
are safe. Friends are always best, but strangers can be helpful if you are
careful to go only where you can maintain control of their approaches
toward your dog.
Ready for others to pet your dog? Once your dog acts as though she
wants to greet strangers, you are ready to condition your dog to enjoy
petting. Fearful dogs can be panicked by an unfamiliar hand reaching
toward them. Just the initial hand movement toward them can be an
intense trigger for many dogs. For moderate to serious cases, you must
divide the act of being petted into several steps.
First, be aware of the different parts of petting that might upset your
dog. The events that scare dogs in this context include: a stranger
walking directly toward them, looking directly at their eyes, bending
over them, and reaching a hand toward the top of their head. Second,
divide these events into individual steps, in the same way that you did
above with “strangers” approaching from a distance. The best way to
introduce petting (the least scary for the dog) is to have the approaching
person turn sideways and put his or her weight on their back foot. Have
the “stranger” drop a treat as they turn toward the dog, and repeat this
action several times. Let the dog come to them and sniff their relaxed,
unmoving hand, which opens only to drop treats. Again, the game is to
keep the intensity level of what scares the dog as low as you can. Here’s
what some sessions might look like, with your friend Ken helping out
you and your dog Duke:
Imagine that the first two sessions with Ken look like this:
•   First, you give Duke a treat as Ken gets within 10 feet.
•   Immediately afterward, Ken tosses a treat, having stopped at 10 feet
     and turned sideways. Ken is looking to the side of Duke, not right
     at him. Ken is talking quietly to you now, in a relaxed voice, but not
     to Duke.
•   Ken tosses another treat to Duke as he steps forward another step
    toward you and Duke.
•   Ken repeats this until he is beside Duke. Duke is breathing
    normally, with a relaxed open mouth, slightly wagging his tail from
    the base, looking up at you on occasion for treats. You observe no
    tense stiffness in Duke’s body. He’s breathing and moving as he
    does when he’s happy and relaxed, so you decide to proceed. (If
    Duke looks tense, Ken should back up and toss treats from farther
    away.)


                                   14
•   Ken gendy drops a treat but continues to hold his hand down by his
    side.
•   Duke lifts up his nose, leans forward and sniffs Ken’s hand. Ken
    drops another treat.
•   Ken drops 3 more treats as he turns, and he then walks away. You
    say: “Oh, too bad, no more treats,” as if in sympathy, and continue
    your walk.
In both of the two sessions above Duke tried to approach Ken, and
sniffed his hand with a relaxed demeanor, so you and Ken agree it’s
time to move on to petting. In the third session:
•   Ken approaches as before, but doesn’t produce a treat until he’s five
    feet from Duke. Ken drops 5 treats, one after the other, while
    approaching closer to Duke. Duke sniffs Ken’s hands, wagging
    with his entire rear end and looking relaxed but excited about the
    hot dogs.
•   Ken holds his hand by his side and opens it up so Duke can take the
    food right out of his hand.
•   Ken puts another treat into his hand and lets Duke eat the treat.
    While Duke is slurping up the treat, Ken raises his other hand about
    6 inches toward the side of Duke’s muzzle or under his chin and then
    drops it back to his side. Ken repeats this three times.
•   Duke continues wagging from the shoulders back, snorting and
    snuffling for more hot dogs, so Ken gives him a treat with his left
    hand. As Duke eats it, Ken raises his other hand up toward the
    underside of Duke’s muzzle, stopping before he actually touches
    him.
•   If Duke has had a serious problem in the past, Ken should continue
     repeating the above process and go no further for this session. If
     Duke has never been aggressive or severly scared, then Ken might
     touch Duke on the side of his head briefly while Duke eats treats
     from Ken’s other hand. All the while, Ken is being careful to move
     slowly and to keep his hand below Duke’s eye level.


This is actually much harder to read about than it is to do. Once you
understand the process and know how to “read” your dog and thus
predict his behavior, it actually becomes very easy. Keep each session
upbeat, and again, always end long before you or Duke start to get
nervous.
Don’t hesitate to link up with a professional if you can’t do this with


                                  15
confidence. One or two sessions with someone who understands
counter conditioning may be all you need to do it on your own.
Safety first: If you have any knowledge that your dog might harm
someone, it is your responsibility to insure that this does not happen. If
your dog might nip or bite if things don’t go well, you simply must take
steps to prevent that from happening. Use a muzzle if necessary (you
can slide treats through the front opening), and have only your own
friends be the “strangers” on the street. Use only those friends who you
can count on to do what you say — this does NOT include all of your
friends, right?! Go slow, remembering that “too far, too fast” may not
only get someone hurt, but will set you and your dog back too.
Don’t fall into the trap of believing that you can use the leash to keep
things safe if the stranger gets too close. This method has at least two
problems: a tight leash creates tension and signals to your dog that this
is a, well, tense situation. That’s the last message you want to convey to
your dog! Secondly, it most likely won’t work.
Your dog’s reaction time is so much faster than yours that you simply
will not be able to react until the dog has already lunged. So keep the
leash slightly loose (just a bit of slack is perfect) and use your body to
keep strangers away from your dog if you have to. Guard against setting
up situations where you HOPE you can keep everything safe — hope
doesn’t get the job done, and it creates a situation where you are
nervous and your dog will pick up on it. It is essential that you role
model being cool, calm, and playful, so be very sure your sessions are
structured in such a way that you can be that cool, calm dog owner your
dog needs.
Continue this routine, step by step, until the dog has overlearned the
association between the trigger and what makes him happy. Always
remember that in times of stress we all tend to “default” to our old
habits, so continue this process long after your dog looks relaxed.
Depending on your dog, the treatment could take only a few weeks, as it
did with Lassie. In severe cases, it could take up to a year. For all dogs, I
recommend never really stopping this conditioning throughout the
dog’s life — after your dog’s behavior has stabilized, continue to be
opportunistic, and have friends toss treats or balls whenever the
occassion arises. I always ask delivery people to toss balls for my dogs
whenever I have a chance. I’ve never had a problem with my dogs and
delivery people, but prevention is so much easier than treatment it
seems foolish not to take an extra second and ask them to toss a ball!
Keep in mind that each new environment or trigger requires going



                                    16
through the entire procedure from the beginning. For example, walking
by one friendly adult man on the sidewalk won’t condition your dog to
be relaxed about two women and stroller walking by in a different
neighborhood. Each situation requires its own intensity. For example,
say a medium-sized, dog-loving woman arrives, who you know to be a
moderate to low intensity trigger for your dog. She can enter two steps
into the house, and then throw a treat, continuing this process until she
sits down on couch and lets dog come to her. That is appropriate
because your dog considers her a low to moderate intensity trigger
stimulus. But a friend who is a tall guy with a beard and hat might be
much scarier to your dog, so in this case you would have your tall, male
visitor go more slowly. The bell rings, you toss the treats, the guy stands
sideways at door, he tosses treats until King looks really happy, and then
the guy leaves.
Both of these situations could occur on the same day. The key is to be
aware of what scares your dog a little, and what scares your dog a lot,
and always work within the dog’s comfort zone.
The worst choice that you can make, (and regretably probably the
easiest) is to start the first steps, forget the last ones and hope like heck
everything works out OK. Take it from the woman who sees families
sobbing in her office every week — deal with it now, because it’s not
going to go away and it will probably just get worse if you don’t work
on it soon.

How long will this take? Hopefully it is clear by now why it is so hard
to write out a single schedule that works for all dogs. What steps you
take each day and how fast you procede always depends on your dog
and his reactions to each session. For preventing problems with a sweet
but slightly cautious young puppy, you just need to be opportunistic
during the first year of your pup’s life. Take your pup with you when
appropriate, go out of your way if necessary to invite over guests who
toss food treats as they enter, and enroll in family dog training classes
that use lots of positive reinforcement. Be sure to have the UPS man and
your mailman toss treats whenever you can (have a can of treats right by
the door, then you’ll always be prepared). These simple steps will make
a big difference in the life of your dog.
Prevention efforts or treating minor problems require little effort, but
older dogs who have an established behavior problem require more


                                    17
time and more organization. Although it is hard to estimate how long
treatment wall take for any one dog, the process described above might
require three to twelve months of work for a dog who is starting to act
out on his fears. Ideally, during that time you will set up situations
where people enter the house or friends pass by on walks 5 to 10 times a
week. That sounds intimidating, but if you can walk each day in a place
with just the right amount of people, then you only need to “organize” a
few events a week. These “organized” events can be really simple. Say
that you have a friend who’s coming over to borrow a book. Just ask
him, before he comes, to ring the bell, and then toss some treats (you’ve
conveniently left some by front the door) before he enters. What you do
from there depends, of course, on how serious your dog’s problem is.
It’s not critical that every week has the same schedule. Some weeks are
busier than others, so every week won’t look the same. Don’t worry
about it, just do what you can, whenever you can.
Good news and bad news: The bad news is that you’re never really
done with this. If you have a dog who is genetically predisposed to be
fearful and/or “protective,” you will want to keep this up all his life.
The good news is that after you go through an intensive conditioning
procedure, it takes far less effort to insure your dog continues his
appropriate associations. If I happen to be home when a delivery person
comes, I ask them to throw tennis balls for my Border collies. If a family
comes to visit, I am sure to take treats down to tire barn so that the kids
can feed goodies to my guard dog Tulip as they enter the sheep pen.
Once your dog responds appropriately, you can use an easy,
opportunistic routine like this. If you see any signs of regression, simply
back up (immediately— don’t wait!) and you’ll find you can go through
the steps quickly and easily the second time around.


Insure your dog overlearns the associations: It’s very seductive to see
signs of improvement in your dog and then stop the program. I can
relate to this easily — I’m full of energy for a new plan for two to three
weeks, and then somehow I find it hard to keep up the routine. I’m
apparently not alone: it is said to take 21 to 28 days to establish a new
habit, and most of us give up at about 14 to 20 days. Problematically,
you often see the most extreme improvement in your dog’s behavior in
the first few weeks, so it’s especially tempting to stop there. But be
warned: it is dangerous to do just enough conditioning so that your dog
isn’t obviously scared any more in some contexts. If your dog looks less
tense externally, but is still afraid internally, you might end up with an
incident that wouldn’t have happened when you were “on guard.” You


                                   18
must keep this program up long after you think you dog is “fine.” It’s
just like studying for an exam. You need to “overlearn” the information,
because in times of stress it’s too easy to forget that chemistry formula
that you thought you knew. And just like us, it’s easy for our dogs to
default back to an old habit that hasn’t fully been replaced yet when
they are under pressure. Smart owners reinforce themselves for each
conditioning session, thereby insuring that THEY keep up the desired
behavior, too! It’s easy to smile at this piece of advice, and then ignore it!
Don’t make that mistake—it takes stamina to re-condition a dog, and we
humans are just as seduced by old habits as dogs are. Stop and think
right now of things you might do to reward yourself for keeping up
with the program. It might make the difference between completely
curing your dog or quitting too early and being sorry later on.
Did you say that I could use this program for something other than a
fear of strangers? You can see now how you could use this method for
anything that a dog (or any other animal) is afraid of, whether it’s the
vacuum cleaner, going to the vet, having her nails trimmed or meeting
other dogs. Just go through the steps as described, balancing the
intensity of the trigger (the “bad”) vs. the treat (the “good”). This
method won’t work, however, in situations where your dog’s behavior
isn’t at least partially motivated by fear. There are many reasons why
dogs can “misbehave,” so if your dog has ever been threatening to
people you must insure that fear is part of their motivation before
starting this process.




                                     19
WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU AND YOUR DOG GET
SURPRISED
All the advice above concerns situations where you have control —
control over the distance people are from your dog, control over when
you open the door to your house, etc. But no matter what you do,
sometimes things aren’t going to go as planned, and it’s important that
you are prepared for those times. After all, if you don’t know how to
respond when you and your dog are surprised, how could your dog?
Be conservative. I’m not talking politics here. This is just another
reminder to play it safe and prevent that old habit from coming back. If
your dog just growled at a visitor, taking him to the farmer’s market on
a busy weekend is probably, uh...not a good idea. If you think you can’t
handle what might happen with a cool, calm demeanor, much less
prevent your dog from scaring someone (and probably himself too),
then play it safe. Put Duke in the back room, take Fido to a kennel for
the weekend, or leave Jenny in the car. Remember that dogs are always
learning something — so each walk, each visitor, each occurence of any
kind is either going to help them improve, or set them back. You get to
decide, at least most of the time.
And what do I do when my dog and I get blind-sided? All the
advice above is based on you being able to control the environment
around you and your dog. But this is life we’re talking about here. Real
life. Life where, no matter how careful you are, “stuff’ happens. So what
do you do if someone surprises both you and King by bolting around a
corner? King’s eyes get like pancakes and he’s barking and lunging like
the dog from hell and all you can think to do is to hold on. Well, that’s a
good start, keep it up. Additionally, consider what you’re holding on
with — be sure the equipment you are using really gives you control
over your dog. My favorite collar/leash combo is to use a good nylon
leash with a head collar or harness with the leash at the chest. If
introduced and used correctly, they give you a tremendous amount of
control over even a big dog. Regular snap collars and “choke” training
collars seem to have little effect on an out-of-control dog, so take the
time to find what works for you, before you get surprised at that corner.
Immediately decrease the intensity of the trigger. If your dog is
barking and lunging and you are both shocked and surprised, you are
not in a position to do some fancy obedience work. Your first job is to
decrease the power of the trigger stimulus as quickly as possible. That
usually means increasing the distance between you and the surprising
stranger. So don’t tell your dog “NO” while standing still, and don’t try
to make him sit if he’s truly panicked. Rather say “NO” or “UGH” in a
calm, quiet voice and simply turn and walk away. If you can’t say
something in a quiet authoritative voice, (perhaps your own voice might
sound a little anxious itself!), then speaking now will only serve to
increase or confirm your dog’s fears (“Oh no, she’s scared too! This
person must be REALLY dangerous!”). In this case, either sing Happy
Birthday, or simply stay silent and walk away.
But here’s the rub. If you simply walk away and do nothing else, what
has your dog learned? (“Walking down the street, walking down the
street, life is good, OH NO OH NO OH HELP DANGER DANGER
BARK BARK LUNGE BARK OH Oh No, oh, they’re going away, oh I
feel better now, oh, thank heavens they’re gone I feel so much better.. .1
bark and then they go, oh I’m so glad they’re gone...”). Your dog got
rewarded for barking and lunging, so it’s easy to predict that she is
going to bark and lunge again next time, isn’t it? If at all possible, get
just far enough away to be able to communicate with your dog, and
then ask for a sit. Sitting is a controlled, measured posture that can help
calm your dog. It asks her to control her reactions to her own emotions,
but is not too imtimidating for her when she’s nervous. (Lie Down is
simply too much to ask of a dog in this context — would you feel better
if asked to Lie Down in an alley right beside the guys you thought were
going to mug you?)
If (and only if the dog is calmer, then SLOWLY, with circular motions,
pet his chest. Avoid those primate-lilce pats on the top of your dog’s
head—they don’t appear to calm dogs, they either irritate them or hype
them up, and that’s the last thing you need. Speak quietly, with long
extended notes:                                    “Gooooooood boy,
wwwwwwwhat a gooooooooood boy you are.” And he IS a good boy
now, right? He’s not barking and lunging, and if you’re lucky, the
stranger is still around, just a little farther away. Treats are fine now, IF
your dog is sitting quietly.
If the person disappears as fast as they appeared, then try to set this
exact situation up again (in the same place, if possible) with a friend
until you can get it to end the way you’d like (safety first!). You want the
dog to learn that the barking and lunging had no effect whatsoever, and
that the person left after he was quiet and calm. That way he’ll learn that
the person wasn’t a danger in the first place, and the way to feel better
and get strangers to go away is to sit down quiedv.
So in summary, if your dog is suddenly over his head, immediately
increase the distance between him and the stranger, stop as soon as you
can, and get King in a sit. Praise, pet and treat him IF he’s good. I’ve
never seen any research on this, but I believe that it’s important to then
replay these situations (this time where you can control the stimulus
better) to insure the right associations are left in your dog’s mind.

                                    ***




Help! I don’t have the time to do this! I can imagine that right around
now a person might be saying: “Good grief! It sounds like I’ll have to
work at least 5 times a week for months and months to successfully turn
my dog around! I love my dog, but I simply don’t have that much time.”
Boy is that a reasonable reaction. If the dog has a serious problem, it will
indeed take a lot of time and energy. Just because you love your dog
doesn’t mean you are in a situation to successfully treat him or her.
Some dog-loving, responsible people find that they simply can not find
the time or emotional energy to keep treating a dog with a serious
behavior problem. Keep remembering that you always have a choice —
perhaps you do indeed have the time to treat this dog, perhaps it is
possible to safely place the dog in another home, or perhaps there is no
other alternative but euthanasia. Only you can make the choice, but
don’t forget that you are not alone. Talk in-depth to experts who treat
serious behavioral problems, and utilize their experience to help you
make the best decision for you and your dog.
Please remember that sometimes the kindest and most loving action is
to place your dog in another home where others will have more time for
him. I placed one of my adult dogs in another home once, and I know
the insecurities that can plague us late at night. “Am I
HERE’S A SUMMARY OF
THE TREATMENT STEPS
1. MAKE IT SAFE: Do all that you can to insure that your dog will
not be surprised and scared by whatever has scared him in the past, and
do all that you can to insure that your dog can’t possibly hurt anyone.
2. DETERMINE TOUR DOG’S TRIGGERS (THE “BAD”):
Have a clear picture of the stimuli that trigger your dog’s fearful
reactions. Be as specific as you can.
3. FIND FIDO’S PASSIONS (THE “GOOD”): Decide what special
food or toy makes your dog crazy with desire, and withhold it except
during treatment sessions.
4. LINK UP HIGH INTENSITY “GOOD” AND LOW INTENSITY
“BAD:” Set up situations where your dog gets whatever she loves right
after noticing a low intensity version of one of her triggers.
5. GRADUALLY INCREASE THE INTENSITY OF THE
TRIGGER: Step by step increase the intensity of the trigger stimulus.
And the last step is the easiest of them all: DON’T SWEAT THE SMALL
STUFF! Unless your dog has a serious problem, don’t feel as though you
must do every single thing right every single time\ There is a lot of wobble
in this system for dogs with mild to moderate problems—you really
don’t need to do everything perfecdy every single time to get it to work.
This booklet is written as carefully and precisely as possible, but dtat
doesn’t mean that everyone reading this booklet needs to be follow
every direcdon to the letter at every moment. Certainly, if your dog has
a serious behavioral problem that might result in an injury you should
be working with a professional. But if they don’t, then all you have to do
is to learn the basics, follow the program to the best of your ability and
don’t sweat the small stuff!
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO TO HELP MY DOG?
The “Leader of the Pack” Program: Every dog feels more secure if he
knows the rules, and if he knows that he can count on you to be in
charge. I suspect that many fearful dogs become aggressive out of a
belief that they must be responsible for the pack’s safety, when they’d
really rather you took charge and let them off the hook. Some dogs are
naturally more predisposed to want to be in charge than others, but all
fearful dogs will profit from understanding that you are in charge, so
they don’t have to be. You don’t get leadership over your dog by being



                                     27
aggressive; you get it by not catering to your dog’s every whim! If your
dog comes up and “begs” to be petted, translate that action into “YO!
Human, pet me now!” You wouldn’t let your child harass you for an
icecream cone while you were on the phone, so don’t let your dog
demand that you get him whatever he wants whenever he wants it.
Look for the booklet How to be LEADER OF THE PACK and have Tour
DOJJ Love Tou For Lt! for more ideas about how to be a benevolent leader.
Obedience Training: Fun, friendly obedience training that uses lots of
positive reinforcement is an essential part of providing boundaries and
leadership for your dog. It’s also like having a large tool box that you
can carry around with you wherever you go — if your dog is doing
something he shouldn’t, obedience training allows you to simply ask
him to do something more appropriate. Imagine, for example that
Clancy is leaping and barking at a squirrel. You could say “NO! ” but
what information would you be conveying to Clancy? Don’t look at the
squirrel? Don’t look over there toward the west? Don’t leap up? Don’t
bark? You can see that “no” gives your dog very little information about
what you’d like him to do. But if your dog is trained and knows a
variety of signals, you could say “Clancy, sit and watch,” which Clancy
will understand to mean: Sit down quietly and look up at my face and
don’t look away until I say “OK.” What a lovely alternative to simply
yelling “No!”
If you don’t know the new positive methods of dog training then go out
of your way to learn them. Enroll in classes (if appropriate) and/or read
as much as you can. Nothing substitutes for one-on- one coaching (how
much could you learn about ice skating from




                                   27
doing the right thing? How do I find the right home?” “Am I betraying
my best friend?” Only you know what’s best, but remember that
although dogs love their humans like family, they can change families
relatively easily. It might hurt your feelings, but your dog can love other
people just as much as she can love you! Be objective: your
responsibility is to provide the best possible environment for your dog.
It may not be your own home. If you are considering placement (or
euthanasia), I strongly encourage you to talk to professionals who
specialize in behavior problems. They can objectively help you consider
reasonable alternatives.
If you do decide that you and your family have the time and the
motivation to work on this, don’t be intimidated by the lengthy
description of the process. It really is easier to do than to describe, once
you get the idea. Just be absolutely sure that you understand the
fundamentals of the program, and once you get started you might be
surprised how easily it becomes part of your day.


How do I know how much to do, and for how long? When you begin
treatment you simply can’t know exactly how long a successful program
will take. In general, the amount of time it takes depends on how
serious the problem is. It can take a couple minutes a day for a few
weeks for a really mild case, and it can take substantially more time for
a severe one. The good news is that you don’t need an hour a day, every
day. But you do need to be able to set up constructive situations for your
dog several times a week, at a minimum. If you are ever unclear about
whether it’s appropriate to move on to another step or not, or whether
you’re doing it often enough, contact someone experienced with these
methods for advice. You wouldn’t just start tinkering under your car’s
hood in hopes that random actions would fix that pesky engine noise, so
don’t make wild guesses about how to condition your dog!


Is there a guarantee that all this work will completely cure my dog?
Nope, not at all. It’s tough on all of us, but there is no way to accurately
predict which dog will be helped or which will not. There are simply too
many variables that drive a dog’s behavior to be able to predict which
dog will respond to treatment. Obviously the more moderate tire
problem, the higher the likelihood of success.
Starting as early as possible, before the behaivor becomes an ingrained




                                    24
habit, will radically increase your chance of success, as will learning as
much as you possibly can about how to train and handle dogs. Dog
training is not something that nice people just automatically know how
to do right. It is a science, a sport and an art. Take it seriously—if you’re
reading this booklet, you have an advanced model dog and you need
advanced level skills to handle him!
A constructive approach for many dog owners is to set a time limit
within which to work, say three, six or 12 months, and then evaluate the
dog’s progress along the way. Ask yourself if the dog is truly
improving, and ask yourself if you are willing to keep up with the
treatment. As importantly, remember that you are never really “done,”
it just gets easier and easier. Prevention is easy, but so is back-sliding.
Always be ready to remind your dog how much fun those strangers
really are, and bask in his enthusiastic greeting when the pizza delivery
boy comes!




                                    24
just reading a book?), but good books can go a long way toward getting
you started on the right track. I have a small book called Beginning
Family Dog Training available through my office (at 608/767-2435) that
you might find useful. Also look for any of the training books by Dr.
Ian Dunbar, Parenting Tour Dog by Trish King, and The Power of Positive
Dog Training by Pat Miller. Avoid books that advise using leash
corrections and punishments as the primary way of communicating
with your dog. Punishment- oriented training should be as extinct as
the dinosaurs.
Operant Conditioning & Other Training Perspectives: Another type
of conditioning is called Operant Conditioning, where the animal learns
to “operate” on it’s environment to get something that he or she likes. I
have often used this method to help fearful dogs once they were over
the worst of their fears. My little dog, Mist, was terrified of unfamiliar
dogs. She was also one of those “get them before they get me” dogs, so
I really had a serious problem that had to be treated in my own
backyard. Operant conditioning was part of her treatment program. I
taught Mist to look toward the new dog when I said “Where’s the
dog,” and then gave her a treat each time she looked. After three
sessions she’d associate the new dog with good things, and thus
became polite. Learn more about Operant Conditioning by picking up
Don’t Shoot the Dog by Karen Pryor and/or Ex-celerated Learning by Dr.
Pamela Reid.
There is always more than one road to any city, so don’t hesitate to be
creative in your quest to calm your animal’s fears. For example, last
week my 100 pound Great Pyrenees decided she was terrified of the
front door, after having come inside it for three years now. Who knows
why! I tried the counter conditioning techniques described in this
booklet for three sessions, giving her hot dogs as she got closer and
closer to the front door. She got better the second session, and then
regressed during the third after a few minutes. So the next time, I
simply walked her on leash inside the other door, went out the
offending door and just turned back around and went in before she
knew what was happening. Why she wasn’t afraid to go out, but was
afraid to go in that particular door is a mystery to me, but by
approaching the problem from a different perspective I saved a lot of
time and got it solved in one session.
Exercise: Under-exercised dogs are more reactive than ones who get




                                   28
enough exercise, so you can raise your dog’s threshold of response (or
lower the intensity of the trigger) just by getting your dog more
exercise. Keep in mind that walking a Retriever or a Standard Poodle
around the neighborhood on a leash does not qualify as exercise, except
maybe for you. Dogs need to trot or run, even if they are just playing
ball in the house. Begin an exercise program for your dog in which they
get to trot fast or run at least two times a day for at least 15 or 20
minutes. They also need mental exercise, and that gets us back to
obedience training! Anxious dogs profit tremendously from having
something constructive to think about rather than their fears, so teach
your dog something else to do. Teach her standard family dog training
commands like sit and stay. Teach her tricks to get both you and your
dog giggling together. Teach him to track a scent or jump over agility
obstacles. Teach him anything but bad habits, and keep his mind and
body busy!
Diet: Be sure your dog is getting a healthy diet— either through high
quality kibble or food you prepare yourself. Some dogs do better on
some food rather than others, so be open to evaluating your dog’s diet
during treatment.

a much-sought afier seminar
speaker. She is the author of
many books, including the
critically acclaimed book, The
Other End of the Leash, and the
award winning For the Love of a
Dog: Understanding Emotion in
You and Your Best Friend.




   So many behavioral problems in dogs result from fear, but fear-based problems can
   become worse if treated incorrectly. This booklet provides a step-by-step explanation of
   counter classical conditioning and can help you prevent and treat behavioral problems
   related to fear—whether your dog’s fears: 1 include the vacuum cleaner, people with hats,
   or the stranger at the door. Covered are the important details related to : identifying exactly
   what triggers set off your dog, creating a step-by-step treatment plan, monitoring your
   progress, and why you need to treat the fear and not just your dog's reaction to it. This;
booklet has helped thousands of dogs and their owners around the country, and can help
you and your dog too!

Comment choisir son chien ?
Une race nous séduit à la fois pour son apparence physique et pour son caractère. Chacun doit se sentir
concerné par l'introduction du chien dans le milieu familial, être prêt à l'accueillir mais surtout à la
garder. C'est un compagnon que l'on adopte pour 10 ou 15 ans. Il existe 330 races de chiens dans le
monde, dont 260 sont élevés en France. Visitez l'une des expositions canines qui ont lieu chaque année
en France pour vous documenter. Demandez conseil auprès des vétérinaires.

Quels documents exiger ?
        ❱   l'attestation de vente

        ❱   la carte d'identification, preuve que le chien a bien été tatoué et enregistré au Fichier
            National Canin

        ❱   Le certificat de naissance qui atteste que le chien est de race pure. Attention, ce document
            n'est pas le pedigree.

        ❱   Le carnet de vaccination

        ❱   Le pedigree d’un chien

        ❱   Le pedigree remplace le certificat de naissance et s'obtient après avoir présenté le chien à
            l'examen de confirmation : à partir de 12 ou 15 mois, selon les races.

        ❱   Lors de cet examen, un juge confirmateur agrée par la société centrale canine :

                o   examine la conformité morphologique du chien au standard de sa race

                o   évalue l'équilibre de son comportement

                o   vérifie son aptitude à reproduire des chiens de race et à contribuer à l'amélioration
                    de la race.

En fonction des résultats, la SCC attribuera ou non le pedigree.

La confirmation
Grâce au pedigree obtenu par votre chien à l'issue de l'examen de confirmation, ses futurs chiots
pourront être inscrits au livre des origines français (LOF) . Si vous ne le faites pas confirmer, ses chiots
ne pourront être cédés ni vendus en tant que chiens de race et ne pourront être inscrits au L.O.F . Les
séances de confirmation sont organisées par les sociétés canines régionales ou par les clubs de race.

Bien éduquer son chien
Avoir un chien c'est prendre une responsabilité civile ainsi qu'un engagement moral : celui d'en prendre
soin et de l'éduquer correctement en lui apprenant à bien se comporter tant à la maison qu'à l'extérieur.

Vous devez l'élever dans la confiance et non dans la crainte, c'est à cette condition que la vie avec votre
chien vous apportera de grandes satisfactions.

Le plus délicat est de faire comprendre à votre chien ce que vous attendez de lui :

       ❱     l'obéissance : ne jamais oublier que le chien a besoin de prendre sa place dans une
             hiérarchie. Il doit comprendre que vous êtes le maître, c'est à dire son chef de meute.

       ❱     La confiance : apprenez-lui la confiance car un chien craintif peut devenir dangereux.

Les clubs d'éducation et d'agility sont des écoles d'apprentissage et non de dressage. Il en existe 750 en
France et dépendent des Sociétés Canines Régionales.

L’éducation du chien
L’importance de la hiérarchie
Le chien est un animal de meute, et se comporte dans une famille comme dans une meute.
La meute est une structure sociale fortement hiérarchisée avec, à sa tête, un dominant, tout en bas, des
dominés, et entre les deux des intermédiaires qui soit sont soumis et se contentent de leur statut
hiérarchique, soit ne le sont pas et vont essayer de gravir des échelons, avec comme but suprême:
prendre la place du dominant!


Dans une famille qui héberge un chien, la structure habituelle devrait être la suivante (aux yeux du
chien !): le dominant est généralement le père, le dominé, le chien. Les autres membres de la famille
peuvent donner des ordres aux chien, et celui-ci les tolère quelles que soient les circonstances.


Dans une meute, le dominant a certaines prérogatives qui n’appartiennent qu’à lui et qu’il faut se
garder de donner à un chien dans une famille, sous peine de voir l’animal chercher à dominer
physiquement (morsures à l’appui) tout son entourage. Ces prérogatives sont les suivantes:
   l’accès libre à la nourriture: le dominant mange avant tout le monde, devant le reste de la troupe, et
    peut à tout moment prendre de la nourriture aux autres chiens. En conséquence, un chien
    normalement hiérarchisé doit manger après ses maîtres, ne pas demander et surtout ne rien
    obtenir du repas de ses maîtres (interdit de donner à manger à table!);
   l’accès libre au lieu de couchage: le dominant choisit son lieu pour dormir, en général en hauteur et
    de placé manière à pouvoir surveiller les alentours. Aussi le lieu de couchage du chien devrait-il être
    choisi par les maîtres, hors d’un lieu de passage et pas dans les chambres… L’exemple type de ce
    qu’il ne faudrait pas faire: laisser au chien l’accès au canapé, d’où il surveille les passages; un réel
    dominant empêchera progressivement l’accès à toute personne, impossible de le déloger!
   l’accès libre à la sexualité; sans objet, encore que certains chiens mâles empêchent l’approche d’un
    homme près de leur maîtresse!


Précisons que tous les chiens ne sont naturellement pas des dominants attendant le moindre faux-pas
de leurs maîtres! Mais certaines précautions simples permettent de ne pas renforcer la position
dominante de quelques individus, et évitent de se retrouver dans es situations où un chien commande à
la maison!




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                       9
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                           06/06/2008



Les tests de caractère chez le chiot
Aucun test n’est fiable à 100 %, mais certaines observations permettent d’évaluer le caractère du chiot :
   Appel au jeu : s’accroupir et taper dans ses mains, le chiot doit s’approcher rapidement en agitant la
    queue (test de socialisation)
   Acceptation des postures de soumission: on doit pouvoir soulever le chiot et le retourner sur le dos
    sans défense de sa part (test de dominance).
   Absence de réaction de peur au moindre bruit ou mouvement brusque (test de socialisation)

Les mordillements
Le contact par morsure est naturel chez le chiot (il a lui aussi son stade oral!). Toutefois, il doit
rapidement apprendre à contrôler la puissance des ses mâchoires; dans l’éducation naturelle, cela se
fait au milieu de la meute: les adultes punissent les chiots qui mordillent trop fort. Il en va de même
dans l’éducation “imposée” par les êtres humains: tout mordillement doit être sanctionné,par la
réprimande (“non!”), et au besoin en le soulevant légèrement par la peau du cou. Si le mordillement a
lieu pendant une séquence de jeu, ce qui est le cas le plus fréquent, il faut interrompre le jeu.

Les comportements d’agression
L’agression prédatrice est habituellement absente (nos chiens sont bien nourris), mais elle peut encore
se manifester: cas du chien qui court après un chat (il faut alors que le maître soit capable de faire
cesser ce comportement), ou du chien de chasse (le dressage a permis de rediriger le comportement de
manière à préserver le gibier). Dans tous les cas, le maître doit contrôler ce comportement.
L’agression hiérarchique ne devrait jamais se produire chez un chien correctement éduqué; si cela se
produit (défense de la nourriture, rébellion ouverte,...), cela constitue un motif de consultation rapide.
L’agression par irritation se produit sur les chiens présentant des douleurs chroniques (arthrose entre
autres): le chien menace ou attaque lors d’une manipulation anodine ou simplement quand on passe
près de lui; il y a donc souvent motif de consultation médicale.
L’agression territoriale (défense d’un territoire: la propriété mais aussi le canapé!) est normalement
inhibé en présence des maîtres.

La propreté
C’est chronologiquement le premier souci des nouveau maîtres, et il faut bien comprendre que
l’éducation que l’on va inculquer à un chiot va à l’encontre de ce qu’il a vécu auparavant.
Dans les premiers jours de sa vie, la mère fait uriner le chiot en faisant sa toilette, cela se passe dans le
“nid”, lieu de la naissance. Le chiot a donc naturellement tendance à revenir vers ce nid pour faire ses
besoins, puisque c’est ce que sa mère lui a enseigné; c’est ce qu’il fait dans les premiers jours de sa vie
dans son domicile d’adoption: l’intérieur de la maison est assimilée au nid, et l’extérieur à un milieu
inconnu et potentiellement hostile. Revenu de promenade, le chiot retrouve son nid et fait
immédiatement ses besoins. C’est rageant, mais naturel!


Tout le travail d’éducation consiste à inverser cette tendance.
Pour cela, profiter des moments où le chiot a le plus envie de faire ses besoins: le matin au réveil et
immédiatement après les repas. Le sortir à ces moments, et le féliciter de façon très démonstrative s’il
élimine dehors; se rappeler qu’une bonne éducation obtient beaucoup plus par la récompense que par la
punition...

FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                            06/06/2008



Si le chiot fait ses besoins à la maison, garder en mémoire qu’un jeune animal n’a aucune mémoire,
même une minute après son forfait: inutile donc de le gronder au matin quand on trouve quinze pipis
dans la cuisine, le chiot ne sait pas que c’est lui qui les a faits! Par contre si vous le surprenez sur le fait,
vous pouvez le réprimander de la voix (“non!”) ou du geste (saisir la peau du cou).
Ne nettoyez jamais ses besoins en présence du chiot: la position accroupie que vous allez prendre est un
appel au jeu (renforcement positif: le chiot associe la présence des besoins et le jeu...)

Le rappel
Autant l’éducation des ordres de posture (assis, couché, donne la patte, fais le beau...) est en principe
facile (forcément, ça marche beaucoup à la récompense!), autant l’éducation du rappel est délicate.
On a toujours tendance à crier sur un chien qui échappe à l’ordre “ici!”, or le jeune chiot associe cela à
une punition; faire donc le plus en douceur possible: s’accroupir (posture d’appel au jeu) et répéter
plusieurs fois le commandement jusqu’à ce que le chiot vienne; le féliciter excessivement!
La pire des erreurs: rattraper à la course un chien qui ne répond pas et le punir physiquement: étonnez-
vous après que le chiot n’ait plus envie de s’approcher!

La marche en laisse
Là aussi, beaucoup de patience est la clé de la réussite. L’apprentissage de la marche en laisse n’est pas
une épreuve de force: plus on tire sur la laisse, plus l’animal va se mettre à tirer de son côté; il faut donc
laisser du mou, et si le chien cherche à trop s’éloigner, donner un coup sec en disant fermement “au
pied”; quand le chien s’exécute, le féliciter en le caressant.
Enseigner, c’est répété, il faut donc garder une attitude la plus constante possible pour obtenir des
résultats.

Le développement du chiot
La période néo-natale (0-15 jours)
Le chiot est aveugle, presque sourd et dépend complètement de sa mère. Le toucher est le sens
dominant, c’est lui qui permet au chiot de retrouver les mamelles pour se nourrir.
Jusque vers 15 jours le chiot ne sait pas faire seul ses besoins, c’est la mère qui l’aide en faisant sa
toilette (léchage de la région ano-génitale).



La période de transition (15-30 jours)
Le chiot achève le développement de son cortex cérébral: il a ouvert les yeux , les conduits auditifs aussi,
le goût et l’odorat deviennent fonctionnels: c’est l’apprentissage des perceptions.
A trois semaines, le chiot peut commencer à laper les liquides; à 4 semaines il commence à mâcher les
petits fragments. A six semaines, toutes ses dents de lait sont en place, il peut donc se nourrir seul.




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                      11
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                           06/06/2008



La période de socialisation (30 jours - 3 mois)
C’est une période clé dans le développement psychique du chiot: il va acquérir les comportements
nécessaires à sa vie en meute (reconnaissance de l’espèce et hiérarchisation).
L’imprégnation correspond à l’identification à l’espèce: en naissant, le chiot ne sait pas qu’il appartient
à l’espèce canine, et c’est l’intensité des rapports avec la mère et le reste de la portée qui va le lui
apprendre. Il est essentiel de garder au moins jusqu’à six semaines le chiot avec sa mère, sous peine de
voir se développer de graves troubles du comportement (déssocialisation primaire).


Au cours de cette période, le chiot est extrêmement sensible à son environnement: plus il sera stimulé,
plus il saura s’adapter ultérieurement à toute variation extérieure; c’est pourquoi les chiots élevés en
famille, qui gardent un excellent souvenir des contacts avec les humains (jeux avec es enfants) sont
beaucoup plus sociables que les chiots élevés isolés.


L’apprentissage de la hiérarchie se fait dès le sevrage: à ce moment, le chiot ne dépend plus que de sa
mère pour se nourrir, mais doit se plier aux codes de la meute pour l’accès à la nourriture, en laissant la
préséance aux dominants.


Au cours des jeux avec le reste de la portée, il apprend aussi le contrôle de la morsure: s’il mord un peut
fort un de ses frères ou sœurs, le mordu manifeste en couinant, et la mère intervient en punissant le
fautif (léger serrage de la peau du cou). Si votre chiot mordille trop fort, adoptez le même comportement
que la mère: saisissez-le doucement par la peau du cou pour décoller légèrement les pattes avant du sol,
en disant fermement “non!”. Le chiot comprendra très bien ce signal.

Ultérieurement: les changements apportés par la puberté
La puberté intervient à partir de six mois chez les petites races, plus tardivement (jusqu’à 10 mois) chez
les grandes races. En dehors des manifestations sexuelles (apparition des chaleurs chez la femelle, désir
de fugues chez certains mâles), c’est aussi une période d’affirmation du caractère: le chien va
définitivement prendre sa place hiérarchique dans la maison, à l’intérieur de la meute constituée par la
famille d’accueil.


C’est donc naturellement un moment où il va falloir être attentif aux excès de dominance. Voir à ce
sujet le topo sur l’importance de la hiérarchie dans l’éducation du chien.

La relation enfant / chien
Pour le développement de l’enfant la présence d’un animal de compagnie est très enrichissante.
L’animal apporte beaucoup de joie, de tendresse et d’émotions. Les rapports sont le plus souvent calmes
et complices. L’enfant y trouve un compagnon et un confident en qui il a confiance. L’animal accepte
l’enfant tel qu’il est, le console et lui donne le sens des responsabilités.

L’enfant raconte souvent ces malheurs aux chiens qui l’écoute et ne juge pas. Le chien donne à l’enfant
le sentiment d’être utile, aimé et l’accueille avec joie afin que la cohabitation entre le chien et l’enfant se
fasse dans de bonnes conditions, c’est aux parents d’apprendre à l’enfant comment se comporter avec le
chien et les gestes à éviter.


La plupart des accidents sont liés aux manques de vigilance des parents. Un chien reste un chien et ses
réactions sont parfois imprévisibles.


Un chien n’est pas un jouet, l’enfant doit apprendre à ne pas le déranger lorsqu’il est en train de dormir
ou de manger. Dans tous les cas les parents ne doivent jamais laisser un enfant seul avec un chien
même si c’est le chien de la famille.




L’identification du chien
L’identification est essentielle pour votre compagnon. Le mode le plus courant est le tatouage : réalisé
par un vétérinaire sur un animal âgé de minimum 2 mois. Le plus souvent à l’intérieur de l’oreille, le
tatouage peut aussi se trouver à l’intérieur de la cuisse.


De nos jours il est aussi possible de faire poser une puce électronique à votre animal.
Il s’agit d’un très petit cylindre de 1 mm de diamètre et de 3 à 5 mm de long. Ce système ne procure
aucune gêne pour l’animal. Cette puce infalsifiable est généralement placée à l’arrière de l’oreille
gauche.


Un lecteur spécial permet de lire le code de la puce à travers la peau. Il est composé de 15 chiffres, les 3
premiers désignent le code du pays (250 pour la France), l’espèce de l’animal (26 pour chiens et les
chats) et identifie l’individu avec les 7 derniers chiffres. Les puces peuvent être lues par les vétérinaires,
refuges, fourrières, polices dès lors qu’ils sont équipés d’un lecteur.


Depuis le mois de juillet 2004, les chiens, chats et furets doivent également disposer d’un passeport
européen si vous voulez voyager avec votre animal. Il s’agit d’un document similaire aux nôtres et
comportant les informations de votre animal : identification, vaccins, nom et adresse du propriétaire…

Chez les chiens l’alimentation est source de bien être et d’équilibre. Contrairement à l’home, le chien
supporte mal les changements de nourriture. L’animal n’éprouve pas de plaisir dans le changement, au
contraire, cela provoque souvent des troubles de la digestion.

L’arrivé du chiot à la maison
L’arrivé du chiot se prépare : il faut penser au matériel nécessaire pour qu’il se sente chez lui et
expliquer les bases de la vie en famille.

Votre chien vient d’arriver dans votre foyer, il est nécessaire de connaître ses besoins et d’établir pour
lui un code de bonne conduite afin qu’il s’y sente rapidement chez lui. Pour cela, certaines règles doivent
être respectées dès le début.

Le choix de son coin
Dès son arrivée, il faut laisser le chien faire connaissance avec son nouvel environnement. Le chiot doit
avoir son coin à lui avec un panier ou une couverture, situé de préférence dans un endroit calme, loin
des passages fréquents. Un chiot dort beaucoup, il faut veillez à ne pas le déranger. Si vous tolérez qu’il
s’installe dans les premiers temps sur le canapé ou le lit, il vous sera très difficile, voire même
impossible de l’en déloger lorsqu’il sera adulte.


Il est préférable de lui choisir également le coin où il prendra ses repas. Deux gamelles sont nécessaires
: une pour la nourriture, l’autre pour l’eau. Veillez à ce que votre chien ait toujours de l’eau fraîche et
propre à sa disposition.

La distribution des repas
Lorsqu’il est chiot, il est préférable de fractionner le nombre de repas en 3 prises jusqu’à 6 mois, puis en
2 jusqu’à la fin de la croissance. A l’âge adulte, on peut se contenter d’un seul repas bien que 2 soient
préférables, notamment pour les chiens de grandes et très grandes tailles

Problèmes comportementaux
Anxiété de séparation
C’est le problème posé par les chiens qui hurlent ou font des dégâts dès qu’ils sont laissés seuls. Cette
situation est le motif de consultation comportementale le plus fréquent chez les vétérinaires.


Contrairement à ce que beaucoup pensent, le chien ne se “venge” pas d’avoir été laissé seul; en général,
les animaux manifestant une anxiété de séparation sont “hyper-attachés”, c’est-à-dire excessivement
dépendants de leur maître(sse): ils le (la) suivent pas à pas, sont toujours dans les jambes, tout juste s’il
est possible de prendre sa douche ou d’aller aux toilettes seul!


Il est alors compréhensible que l’éloignement de la personne d’attachement représente pour ces chiens
une source d’anxiété aiguë: les manifestations que les propriétaires observent (pleurs, hurlements,
déprédations, mictions et défécations près de la porte de sortie) sont des symptômes de peur.


En conséquence, ne surtout pas gronder une animal en constatant les dégâts: on renforcerait alors le
phénomène anxieux. En examinant le comportement des maîtres qui possèdent un chien anxieux, on
s’aperçoit qu’ils ont mis en place un certain nombre de rituels qui ne font que renforcer l’anxiété de
l’animal:
        •   Rituels de départ: au moment de partir, le maître explique à son chien qu’il va revenir, que
            son absence est temporaire, que l’animal n’a pas à s’inquiéter, etc... De tout ce discours, le



©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                      16
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                          06/06/2008



            chien ne retient qu’une chose: “Mon maître (ma maîtresse) va s’en aller”, ce qui l’inquiète
            encore plus.
        •   Rituels de retour: quand le maître / la maîtresse revient, le chien est fou de joie et manifeste
            au-delà du raisonnable: on n’a souvent pas le temps de poser ses vêtements / ses courses /
            son sac, que l’on est harcelé par l’animal qui saute dans tous les sens et aboie son
            contentement. La plupart des propriétaires ont pris l’habitude de répondre immédiatement
            à cette demande d’affection, ce qui est compréhensible, mais en quelque sorte récompense le
            comportement du chien en leur absence (on le félicite d’avoir aboyé tout le temps).


Le traitement de l’anxiété de séparation consiste d’abord à cesser ces rituels:
        •   Au départ, partir le plus simplement possible: écourter les préparatifs, ne pas parler au
            chien: faites tomber la pression!
        •   Au retour: ne pas s’occuper du chien! (au début, ce n’est pas évident: le chien saute, aboie,
            etc...) Quand le chien s’est calmé (et seulement à ce moment), appeler le chien et le caresser
            pour lui manifester votre affection. Mais c’est vous qui avez choisi le moment, c’est très
            important.


Votre vétérinaire va vous aider en prescrivant des anxiolytiques; mais ces produits ne traitent pas le
chien, ils l’aident pendant sa rééducation. il faut donc prévoir des traitements longs (2 à 3 mois) pour
que le chien ait le temps de se remettre en place.



Fugues
Certaines races de chiens sont indéniablement très fugueuses: le Husky, dans une moindre mesure le
Labrador en sont des exemples.


La sexualité a également un rôle déterminant: il est fréquent de voir un mâle déserter le domicile quand
une chienne est en chaleur à proximité.


Enfin il est important de noter que la place du chien au sein de la cellule familiale est importante: si le
chien ne partage pas d’activités avec la famille, le risque qu’il aille trouver un groupe plus accueillant à
ses yeux est réel.


Aussi la prévention est-elle essentielle: au moment de la puberté (6-8 mois), privilégier les rapports avec
le chien (beaucoup de jeu), pour l’intégrer au maximum dans le groupe familial.


Une fois le comportement installé, il sera beaucoup plus difficile de revenir en arrière; l’introduction
d’un autre chien peut être tentée, afin de créer un groupe plus cohérent. pour un certain nombre de
chiens (mâles), la castration peut être tentée, mais ne marche pas à tous les coups...

Phobies et anxiétés
Les phobies sont des comportements de peurs déclenchés par une cause qui n’est pas réellement
menaçante pour l’animal (voitures par exemple: chien incapable de s’approcher d’un véhicule, même
arrêté). L’état phobique est évolutif, le sujet atteint a toujours tendance à anticiper la survenue de




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                    17
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                             06/06/2008



l’évènement qui provoque sa phobie, ce qui le rend craintif à de plus en plus de facteurs; ainsi le chien
passe d’un état phobique à un état anxieux permanent, avec repli sur soi (peur de tout).


Comme dans tous les troubles comportementaux, le traitement va associer la thérapeutique
(médicaments psychotropes) et la thérapie (travail d’éducation ou de rééducation); dans les phobies,
c’est principalement le contre-conditionnement par le jeu qui va être utilisé. Dans le cas d’une phobie
des voitures par exemple, on travaillera avec un jouet (balle, morceau de bois ...) que l’on enverra de
plus en plus près d’un véhicule arrêté, puis moteur démarré, etc... La thérapeutique dite “par
immersion” peut être essayée, mais elle est plus violente: elle consiste par exemple pour un chien qui a
peur de la foule à le forcer à sortir bien tenu en laisse, en plein milieu d’un marché aux heures
d’affluence (possible sur un jeune chiot, assez déconseillé sur un adulte: réactions violentes à craindre!)


L’anxiété se définit par une augmentation des comportements de peur en réponse à une variation du
milieu (intérieur ou extérieur); en conséquence, le chien perd une bonne partie de ses capacités
d’adaptation à l’environnement.


Il existe de nombreuses variétés d’anxiété: paroxystique (crises violentes), intermittente (pouvant
déclencher des séquences d’agression par peur, extrêmement dangereuses car non contrôlées dans leur
puissance), permanente (entraînant une baisse globale des relations avec l’entourage: c’est un état
proche de la dépression, s’accompagnant souvent de séquences de léchage obsessionnel).
Les anxiétés peuvent évoluer vers l’état dépressif; c’est pourquoi il importe de les dépister et de les
traiter aux premiers stades.

Agression hiérarchique
Les agressions hiérarchiques posent le problème comportemental le plus grave chez les chiens: pour
certaines races de grand format, le danger potentiel est tel que l’euthanasie devra pouvoir être
envisagée.


Mais dans la plupart des cas, les individus potentiellement dominant sont rapidement dépistés,
notamment à la puberté (6 - 9 mois); pour l’immense majorité, ce sont des mâles, et ils veulent
manifester leur dominance hiérarchique en imposant leur mode de vie au reste de la meute, c’est à dire
à leur famille d’accueil.


Les signes d’alerte sont ceux d’une dominance excessive:
    -   Interdiction par le chien de l’accès à la nourriture: le chien grogne si on veut lui retirer sa
        gamelle ou un jouet qu’il a dans la gueule;
    -   Interdiction par le chien de l’accès à certains lieux: canapé, lit, zone de couloir, etc...
    -   Et évidemment toute agression physique pour quelque raison que ce soit (toilettage notamment)


Toute agression doit être sévèrement réprimée, au besoin par des moyens physiques; l’agression est la
seule cause pour laquelle la punition physique est excusable. Rappelez-vous qu’un jeune chien qui
provoque un “supérieur”, ainsi que doit être considéré tout membre de la famille, s’attend à une
opposition; c’est ainsi que cela se passe dans la nature: le jeune teste son entourage, et s’il ne rencontre
que de la passivité, il comprendra qu’on vient de lui autoriser à franchir un échelon hiérarchique. C’est

FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                         06/06/2008



comme cela que s’installe des situations dans lesquelles le chien est maître à la maison, et où personne
ne peut l’approcher.


Si la structure hiérarchique est fortement altérée, il devient très difficile, voire risqué, de faire marche
arrière; le traitement qui sera mis en place demandera une coopération de tous les membres de la
famille, qui doivent impérativement aller tous dans le même sens (le chien dominant sentira
immanquablement défaut dans l’homogénéité de l’attitude adoptée, et s’y engouffrera!). La
thérapeutique prescrite en appoint de la “régression sociale dirigée” (forme de thérapie qui consiste à
faire redescendre les échelons hiérarchiques) ne doit jamais faire perdre de vue que dans les grandes
races, les vrais dominants sont des chiens dangereux. Une volonté inflexible et un dialogue permanent
avec le vétérinaire traitant sont indispensables. Dans les cas les plus critiques, afin d’éviter des
accidents graves, l’euthanasie est hélas la seule solution...



Thérapeutique et thérapies
Le traitement des troubles comportementaux associe toujours:
    -   Un médicament actif sur les transmetteurs neurologiques (psychotrope): c’est la thérapeutique
    -   Un ensemble d’actions menées pas le maître pour rééduquer son chien: c’est la thérapie.


Les deux sont indissociables. La thérapeutique est utilisée pour que l’animal s’adapte au nouvel état
que la thérapie va lui imposer. Autrement dit, les médicaments ne sont qu’une aide et la thérapie
constitue le réel traitement.


Il est donc capital que la thérapie soit bien expliquée et bien comprise. Votre vétérinaire est bien
évidemment l’interlocuteur privilégié avec lequel vous aurez à dialoguer si votre animal rencontre des
problèmes comportementaux.

Quelle est la liste des chiens susceptibles d'être
dangereux ?
Les types de chiens susceptibles d'être dangereux sont répartis en deux catégories :
        •   1ère catégorie : les chiens d'attaque
        •   2ème catégorie : les chiens de garde et de défense

1- Les chiens d'attaque
Relèvent de la 1ère catégorie les chiens non inscrits à un livre généalogique reconnu par le ministère de
l'Agriculture et assimilables par leurs caractéristiques morphologiques aux chiens de races :
        •   Staffordshire terrier et American Staffordshire terrier (ces deux types de chiens sont
            communément appelés "pit-bulls") ;
        •   Mastiff, communément appelés " boer-bulls ",
        •   Tosa.

2- Les chiens de garde et de défense
Relèvent de la 2ème catégorie les chiens suivants, inscrits au livre généalogique reconnu par le
ministère de l'Agriculture :
         •    les chiens de race Staffordshire terrier ;
         •    les chiens de race American Staffordshire terrier
Attention : la 2ème catégorie n'inclut pas les Staffordshire Bull Terriers, race plus petite et sans
dangerosité avérée ;
         •    les chiens de race Rottweiler ;
         •    les chiens de race Tosa.
Relèvent également de la seconde catégorie les chiens ressemblant aux chiens de race Rottweiler, qui ne
sont pas inscrits à un livre généalogique reconnu par le ministre de l'agriculture.


Bon à savoir : les éléments de reconnaissance des chiens de la 1ère et de la 2ème catégorie ci-dessus
mentionnés figurent en annexe de l'arrêté du 27 avril 1999.


Sachez que le détenteur d'un chien inscrit sur cette liste doit remplir des conditions et accomplir des
formalités.

Quelles conditions faut-il remplir pour détenir un chien
susceptible d'être dangereux ?
Le propriétaire ou le détenteur d'un chien inscrit sur la liste des chiens susceptibles d'être dangereux
doit :
         •    être âgé de 18 ans au moins,
         •    ne pas être une personne majeure sous tutelle (à moins qu'il n'y ait été autorisé par le juge
              des tutelles) ;
         •    ne pas avoir été condamné pour crime ou à une peine d'emprisonnement avec ou sans sursis
              pour délit inscrit au bulletin n° 2 du casier judiciaire ;

Quelle est la réglementation applicable aux chiens
d'attaque exclusivement ?
Les chiens d'attaque ou de 1ère catégorie appartiennent à la liste des types de chiens susceptibles d'être
dangereux. Certaines mesures concernent exclusivement ces chiens.


L'acquisition, la cession à titre gratuit ou onéreux, l'importation et l'introduction sur le territoire
métropolitain, dans les départements d'outre-mer et dans la collectivité territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-
Miquelon sont interdites. Toute infraction à cette mesure est punie d'une peine de six mois
d'emprisonnement et de 15.000 EUR d'amende.


La stérilisation de ces animaux attestée par un certificat vétérinaire est obligatoire.
Toute infraction à cette mesure est également punie d'une peine de six mois d'emprisonnement et de
15.000 EUR d'amende.


L'accès aux transports en commun, aux lieux publics, à l'exception de la voie publique, aux locaux
ouverts au public ainsi que le stationnement dans les parties communes des immeubles collectifs sont
interdits.


La détention peut être interdite dans les logements par les règlements de copropriété ou les contrats de
location.


Sur la voie publique, dans les parties communes des immeubles collectifs, les chiens de première
catégorie doivent être muselés et tenus en laisse par une personne majeure (disposition commune aux
chiens de garde et de défense ou de deuxième catégorie).


En 2006 et 2007, de nouvelles mesures ont été prises :
   En 2006, les patrouilles des services de police sur la voie publique ont été renforcées afin de
    constater et sanctionner tout manquement à la loi ;
   En 2007, des pouvoirs supplémentaires ont été accordés au maire et, par défaut, au préfet :
   Placement, et éventuellement euthanasie, des chiens dangereux réputés présenter un danger grave
    et immédiat et dont les propriétaires ne respectent pas les précautions auxquelles ils doivent se
    conformer,
   Renforcement des sanctions en cas de défaut de déclaration (le maire, ou à défaut, le préfet peut
    mettre en demeure le propriétaire de procéder à la régularisation de la situation du chien dans un
    délai d'un mois sous réserve de placement, puis après un nouveau délai d'un mois ordonner sans
    délai son euthanasie),
   Demande d'évaluation de comportement auprès d'un vétérinaire agréé

Quelle démarche doit effectuer le détenteur d'un chien
susceptible d'être dangereux ?

Nouveaux textes législatifs et réglementaires relatifs aux chiens susceptibles d'être dangereux
Des textes législatifs et réglementaires à venir ont été annoncés par le Ministre de l'Intérieur en
septembre 2007.


L'évolution de la législation devrait porter sur :
   L'instauration d'une formation obligatoire pour les propriétaires ou détenteurs de chiens dangereux.
   La production obligatoire d'un certificat établi par un vétérinaire au moment de la déclaration en
    mairie.
   Le renforcement des pouvoirs de l'autorité administrative pour ordonner l'euthanasie.
   L'interdiction des croisements susceptibles de produire des chiens dangereux.
   L'interdiction de détention des chiens de première catégorie nés après la loi du 6 janvier 1999.
   Le renforcement du contrôle des importations des chiens de deuxième catégorie


Le propriétaire ou le détenteur d'un chien inscrit sur la liste des chiens susceptibles d'être dangereux
doit remplir un dossier de déclaration à la mairie du lieu de résidence du propriétaire de l'animal ou,
quand il diffère de celui de son propriétaire, du lieu de séjour habituel de l'animal.



L'imprimé de déclaration :
        ❱     Pour un chien de première catégorie porte le n° CERFA 11459*02
        ❱     Pour un chien de seconde catégorie porte le n° CERFA 11461*02.



Le dossier comprendra les pièces justificatives suivantes :
        ❱     Identification du chien,
        ❱     Vaccination antirabique du chien en cours de validité,
        ❱     Certificat vétérinaire de stérilisation des chiens mâles et femelles de la première catégorie
              (chiens dits d'attaque),
        ❱     Assurance responsabilité civile du propriétaire du chien ou de celui qui le détient, pour les
              dommages causés aux tiers par l'animal.


Au vu de ces pièces, un récépissé est délivré. Une fois la déclaration déposée, le propriétaire ou le
détenteur du chien doit remplir ces conditions en permanence.


Attention : en cas de changement de résidence, une déclaration doit être déposée à la mairie du
nouveau domicile.

Chiens dangereux : le projet de loi est adopté en première
lecture par les députés

Mercredi 28 novembre en soirée, les députés soir ont examiné en première lecture le projet de loi sur les
chiens dangereux et modifié plusieurs dispositions adoptées par les sénateurs.


Comme le rappelait Michèle Alliot-Marie, ministre de l'Intérieur, ce texte est le dernier d'une longue
série de mesures visant à lutter contre les risques que présente la détention de certains types de chiens.


La loi de 1999 a d'abord permis de sanctionner l'utilisation, dans les quartiers sensibles, de chiens
dangereux (le plus souvent des pitbulls) comme arme par destination. La loi du 5 mars 2007 a confié des
pouvoirs supplémentaires à l'autorité administrative.


Malgré cet arsenal législatif et réglementaire, le problème n'est pas réglé comme l'a montré une série de
faits divers dramatiques, cet été notamment, lorsque plusieurs enfants ont trouvé la mort.


Formation à l'éducation canine sanctionnée par une «attestation d'aptitude», «évaluation
comportementale» des chiens mordeurs, déclaration obligatoire en mairie de toute morsure, quel que
soit le chien, peine de 10 ans de prison encourue par les propriétaires de chiens responsables
d'agressions mortelles: telles sont les principales dispositions du texte, déjà adopté au Sénat le 8
novembre.


Les députés sont allés plus loin que les sénateurs en votant un «permis de détention» pour les chiens
jugés les plus dangereux, remis par le maire de la commune et subordonné à l'obtention de cette
«attestation d'aptitude». Ce permis rassemblera toutes les prescriptions applicables, du certification
d'aptitude à l'évaluation comportementale. Il faudra que toute personne accompagnant ce type de chien
en soit porteur sur la voie publique, ce qui permettra de simplifier les contrôles. Selon les députés, les
forces de l'ordre pourront ainsi vérifier immédiatement que les différentes règles en vigueur sont
respectées, notamment l'obligation de stérilisation.


Estimant que «le critère du poids pose trop de problèmes d'application», ils ont supprimé une mesure
introduite par les sénateurs et prévoyant de soumettre à une «évaluation comportementale» tout chien
d'un poids de 30 kilos et plus. Il en est de même pour l'Observatoire du comportement canin créé par le
Sénat, les députés ne voyant pas nécessité d'instaurer un tel Observatoire puisque les services du
ministère réalisent déjà de telles études. Concernant les sociétés de gardiennage, une disposition
adoptée impose la mention du numéro d'identification du chien sur la carte professionnelle des
personnels des sociétés privées de sécurité, ainsi qu'une formation spécifique pour ces maîtres-chiens.
Les députés ont renoncé à obliger les propriétaires de mygales, serpents ou autres crocodiles à déclarer
ces animaux de compagnie quelque peu singuliers, la ministre de l'Intérieur Michèle Alliot-Marie
s'engageant à «regarder ce dossier très attentivement».


Le texte doit désormais repartir en navette vers le Sénat pour un examen en deuxième lecture.

La santé et les soins
Comment se débarrasser des parasites externes ?

LES RISQUES ET LA PRÉVENTION DES PARASITES.
Les parasites externes les plus fréquents sont les puces et les tiques. Ces petits animaux indésirables
provoquent chez votre compagnon des démangeaisons, mais peuvent également lui transmettre des
maladies.

COMMENT LES RECONNAÎTRE ?

LES TIQUES :
Les tiques mesurent de 3 à 17 mm ; elles se reconnaissent à leur corps plat à jeun et un peu bombé
lorsqu'elles se sont nourries de sang. Elles se fixent là où la peau de votre chien est la plus fine,
principalement à l'encolure, aux oreilles et à la tête.


C'est au cours du repas de ce parasite que votre compagnon court le plus grand risque : la salive de la
tique peut être le vecteur de micro-organismes infectieux provoquant une piroplasmose (maladie très
dangereuse). Les symptômes de cette infection sont une grande fatigue, un manque d'appétit et une
coloration anormalement foncée des urines de votre animal.


Les tiques prolifèrent dans des endroits plutôt humides et abrités comme les haies, les jardins, les
prairies, les niches. C'est au printemps (de mai à juin) et à l'automne ( de septembre à octobre).


ATTENTION DANGER : Les tiques peuvent transmettre une maladie mortelle qui s’appelle la
PIROPLASMOSE. En effet, les tiques femelle servent de vecteur à un parasite microscopique de la
famille des Protozoaires : Babésia canis.


Très fréquentes au printemps et en automne, elles représentent un risque important actuellement pour
votre chien; qu'il vive en zone urbaine (jardin, parcs, … ) ou en zone rurale ( hautes herbes, bois, …. ).Et
cela contrairement à une idée trop souvent répandue qui veut que les tiques ne soient présentes dans
notre région que durant l’été .


Le graphique ci dessous représente la variation en fonction des mois des cas de piroplasmoses, donc du
risque d’infestation par les tiques. Basé sur les statistiques réalisées au sein de notre clinique, il montre
nettement un risque maximal en Mars, mais aussi en Octobre et Novembre.

FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                         06/06/2008




Comment va se manifester cette maladie ?
A l'occasion d’un repas de sang prélevé sur un chien, la tique va donc inoculer ce fameux parasite. Celui
ci, après une période d’incubation de plusieurs jours, va commencer à se multiplier de façon importante
dans les globules rouges.
Cette multiplication va être à l’origine d’une destruction massive des globules rouges. Elle va
s’accompagner généralement de fatigue, d’une poussée de fièvre (la température rectale monte souvent
jusqu'à 41° C !), et d’une anémie qui se caractérise aisément par une décoloration des muqueuses :
intérieur des babines et des paupières.
D’autres symptômes moins caractéristiques peuvent apparaître, comme des troubles nerveux, digestifs,
cutanés..
Après quelques jours de maladie, on va observer l'apparition d’une hémoglobinurie se manifestant par
une coloration brunâtre des urines. Il s'agit d'un élément clinique très connu des chasseurs, dont les
chiens sont souvent confrontés à cette maladie, en l’absence de traitements anti-tiques adaptés.

LES PUCES :
Les puces se reconnaissent à leur corps rouge brun doté de grandes pattes : leur aptitude au saut
facilite leur passage d'un animal à l'autre.


Si les puces sont moins dangereuses que les tiques, leurs piqûres sont cependant douloureuses et
produisent d'intenses démangeaisons. L'irritation occasionnée par leurs piqûres force chiens et chats à
se mordiller. Par ce biais, les animaux risquent d'avaler les puces porteuses de larves de ténia
provoquant en particulier des démangeaisons anales. D'autre part, les allergies causées par les piqûres
sont souvent cause d'eczéma.


Les puces passent 90% de leur vie ailleurs que sur le pelage des animaux et représentent donc
également une gêne pour l'environnement de l'homme. Elles se plaisent particulièrement dans les
endroits difficiles d'accès où s'amasse la poussière : rainures du sol, parquets, moquettes, dessous de
lits, coussins, paniers, niches, voitures ect...


Pour s'en débarrasser, il est donc indispensable de traiter à la fois l'animal et son environnement.
Les puces prolifèrent toute l'année mais plus rapidement au printemps et à l'automne.

PLUSIEURS MOYENS DE LUTTE SONT A VOTRE DISPOSITION :


    ❱   SHAMPOOING : Il élimine rapidement les parasites et combine l'action d'un shampooing
        classique à celui d'un shampooing antiparasitaire. L'application se déroule à l'occasion du bain.
    ❱   POUDRE ET AEROSOL : Méthode pratique pour les animaux difficiles à baigner. Ces produits
        sont destinés à l'application locale et protègent l'animal pendant une à deux semaines.
    ❱   LOTION : Elle s'applique sur l'animal, sans rinçage, son action est curative et immédiate.


LE DEPARASITAGE DE L'ENVIRONNEMENT :
    ❱   AEROSOL : Il permet de traiter les niches, les tapis, les coussins, les sols ou encore les murs.
    ❱   SPRAY : Il est prévu pour déparasiter l'environnement de façon durable (environ 6 mois)
        lorsqu'il est composé d'un inhibateur de croissance.
    ❱   FOGGER : Produit sous forme de fumée, couvrant une pièce d'environ 80 m2.


LA PROTECTION LONGUE DUREE :
    ❱   COLLIER ANTIPARASITAIRE : Si certains modèles combattent les tiques et d'autres les puces,
        la plupart lutte simultanément contre ces deux parasites. Ce collier doit être remplacé
        régulièrement (tous les 1 à 4 mois). Différents modèles sont disponibles selon la taille de votre
        animal. Il en existe de spécifiques pour chiots et chatons.
    ❱   PIPETTE : Elle s'utilise sur un animal de plus de 6 mois et le protège pendant 1 mois.



Comment veiller à la bonne santé de votre chien ?
    ❱   SES YEUX : Pour éviter les traces dues aux écoulements, utilisez régulièrement une lotion
        lavante ou des lingettes adaptées.
    ❱   SES OREILLES : Effectuez un nettoyage tous les mois avec un coton tige adapté imbibé d'un
        lait spécifique.
    ❱   SES COUSSINETS : Sensibles, les coussinets sont aussi sujet aux abcès et aux mycoses.
    ❱   Vérifiez régulièrement leur état en coupant les poils qui y poussent. En cas d'infection, consulter
        votre vétérinaire.
    ❱   SES DENTS : Pour limiter la formation de tartre, offrez régulièrement à votre anima des os de
        mastication, notamment à la chlorophylle. Il existe également des dentifrices spécifiques pour
        chiens ainsi que des brosses adaptées. Si malgré ces précautions, vous constatiez que votre
        compagnon a une forte haleine, pensez à consulter votre vétérinaire : ce peut être le signe d'une
        infection des gencives.
    ❱   SA PEAU ET SON POIL : Le choix d'un shampoing spécifique et de qualité protègera
        efficacement la peau de votre chien. Veillez à ne pas le shampouiner trop souvent pour ne pas
        dénaturer son poil. Sachez que la peau du chien est plus fragile que celle de l'homme.

Comment toiletter votre chien ?
La fréquence du bain s'apprécie au cas par cas, notamment en fonction des habitudes de sortie et de jeu
de votre animal. Retenez qu'un chien ne doit pas être lavé trop souvent : une fréquence de toilettage
excessive élimine le sébum protecteur de son pelage et altère l'aspect naturel de son poil.


Quand cela est nécessaire, pensez tout d'abord à disposer un tapis antidérapant dans votre baignoire.




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                    28
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                         06/06/2008



Démêlez soigneusement le pelage de votre compagnon avant de le mouiller progressivement avec une
eau tiède (environ 38°). Veillez à ne pas introduire d'eau dans ses oreilles : il semble judicieux de lui
laver le tête en dernier car cela le conduit souvent à s'ébrouer !


Utiliser uniquement un shampoing pour chiens : le vôtre n'est pas adapté. Lavez et rincez-lui la tête en
portant attention à ne pas mouiller ses yeux, ni l'intérieur de ses oreilles.


Pour le sécher, essuyez-le avec une serviette puis terminez avec un séchoir électrique en vitesse lente,
tenu à bonne distance de votre animal. Vérifiez enfin que votre chien soit bien sec pour éviter qu'il
prenne froid.

Les soins du pelage
La peau est un organe vivant, et le pelage est souvent le reflet de la santé du chien . Des mesures
simples permettent de préserver la beauté de la robe de nos compagnons.

Le brossage, acte de base de l’entretien du pelage.
Pour les races à poils longs (briard ou lévrier afghan par exemple), cela devrait être un acte quotidien.
Un bon pansage prend du temps, mais cet acte pourra être écourté s’il est effectué fréquemment.
Le bon outil est une carde , qui permet d’éliminer le poil mort sans trop tirer; il faut procéder par petites
mèches, progressivement d’avant en arrière.
S’il y a des nœuds dans le pelage, on peut éventuellement couper le poil, mais en prenant toutes
précautions pour ne pas entailler la peau (faites très attention, cela arrive même aux professionnels!).
Si on se laisse dépasser par les évènements, il peut arriver que le débourrage vous paraisse impossible;
confiez alors votre animal à un toiletteur. N’attendez pas trop, dans certains cas, la bourre peut
recouvrir tout l’animal et obliger à une tonte intégrale!

Shampooings
Chez le chien, il apparaît obligatoire sur les races blanches à poils longs (bichons, westie, coton de
Tuléar, caniches), qui se salissent rapidement. Dans les autres cas, c’est plus facultatif (ou “accidentel”:
cas du chien qui se roule dans la boue!).


Dans tous les cas, choisissez un produit adapté à votre animal. malheureusement, la mention
“shampooing pour animaux” ne vous garantit pas toujours une parfaite tolérance. Un conseil: parlez-en
à votre vétérinaire, il saura vous préconiser le shampooing ad hoc.


En usage ponctuel, le bon vieux savon de Marseille reste le produit courant qui fait le moins de mal aux
animaux; les shampooings pour l’homme sont peu adaptés (l’épiderme des carnivores est beaucoup plus
fin , et le pH est différent).


Un détail à connaître, les shampooings dégraissent et déshydratent la peau. Celle-ci va réagir en se
regraissant (dépôt de sébum qui va recouvrir de nouveau l’épiderme en 48 heures). Or c’est le sébum qui
véhicule la fameuse odeur de chien mouillé dont se plaignent certains propriétaires; la répétition des
shampooings va dans un premier temps améliorer le problème, mais à terme l’odeur revient plus forte.
il est donc déconseillé de traiter un problème d’odeur du pelage par des shampooings tout-venant. Là
encore, il existe des produits spécialisés que votre vétérinaire pourra vous conseiller (shampooings anti-
séborrhéiques, lotions réhydratantes).

Tonte - toilettage


Cela concerne uniquement certaines race de chiens: tonte chez les caniches, bichons frisés, épilation
chez certains Terriers ...


Le toilettage est confié ... aux toiletteurs! Certains caniches doivent y être conduits tous les deux mois,
ce qui représente un certain investissement - et fait partie des facteurs à prendre en considération dans
le choix de la race.

Mue
Le pelage se renouvelle régulièrement; chaque poil subit un cycle de croissance, puis meurt avant d’être
remplacé.


A certaines périodes de l’année, la chute des poils est plus importante: c’est la mue, qui est un
phénomène tout à fait naturel, mais parfois un peu envahissant, surtout chez certaines races ( berger
allemand, beauceron, épagneul breton ...)


On ne peut évidemment pas empêcher ce phénomène, mais certains produits composés de vitamines et
d’acides gras essentiels peuvent le limiter dans le temps; ces produits permettent par ailleurs une
meilleure repousse du poil. des cures sont préconisées au printemps et en automne (3 semaines en mars
et septembre par exemple).

Parasites
Le toilettage est l’occasion de repérer certains hôtes indésirables:


        o   les puces, petits parasites aplatis latéralement, se déplaçant rapidement entre les poils, et
            laissant des déjections plus faciles à repérer, car elles ne bougent pas! (typiquement en
            forme de virgule, noirâtres);
        o   les tiques, parasites fixés, aplatis dorsoventralement, et dont l’abdomen se gonfle de sang
            chez la femelle; plus rares chez le chat qui sait mieux se toiletter que le chien;
        o   les poux, petits parasites grisâtres lentement mobiles. Ils sont plutôt rares et absolument
            pas contagieux à l’homme (espèces différentes);
        o   les aoûtats, petits parasites rougeâtres présents entre les doigts et à la base des oreilles;


Tous ces parasites sont évidemment à éliminer; pour les tiques, il existe un petit crochet qui permet de
les retirer sans douleur pour l’animal, mais cela n’est possible que pour un petit nombre de parasites.
Dans les autres cas, un traitement insecticide sera appliqué sur l’animal.

Compléments nutritionnels
Nous en avons déjà parlé à propos de la mue; il est important de préciser que certains aliments
(“premiums”) incluent ces composants dans leur composition, ce qui permet de traiter l’animal tout au
long de l’année. Ceux qui nourrissent leur chien avec ce type d’aliment reconnaissent d’ailleurs que la
robe présente un meilleur aspect.

Votre vétérinaire sera à même de vous orienter vers la catégorie d’aliment la mieux adaptée à votre
animal.

Bains de mer
N’oubliez jamais de rincer un chien qui sort de la mer! La présence de sel à la racine du poil peut
entraîner de belles crises de démangeaison qui peuvent se transformer en dermite (inflammation
cutanée). Un petit rinçage au jet vous évitera quelques soucis!

En cas de problèmes dermatologiques ....
La dermatologie est un domaine qui peut difficilement se traiter par correspondance, et qui supporte
peu d’approximations. Si vous observez des lésions (boutons, croûtes, plaques, pellicules ou autres...), la
meilleure chose que vous puissiez faire est de prendre conseil auprès d’un vétérinaire: il est le seul à
bien connaître ce domaine, dans lequel le temps est souvent le pire ennemi: une affection bénigne
soignée au début guérira en quelques jours, alors qu’une surinfection secondairement installée pourra
prendre plusieurs semaines de traitement.

Cardiologie du chien

L’appareil circulatoire


Il est constitué d’une pompe (le cœur) et d’un ensemble de tuyaux (les vaisseaux sanguins), chargés de
véhiculer un liquide de transport (le sang).


C’est donc un système de distribution:
    •     entre les poumons d’une part et les organes pour le transport de l’oxygène
    •     entre les différents organes pour le transport des métabolites (déchets transformés par le foie et
          éliminés par les reins), messagers (hormones), et autres...


Le moteur est représenté par le cœur; sa fonction première est d’assurer une pression constante
(pression artérielle) dans le circuit. Si cette fonction fait défaut, cela conduit à une insuffisance
cardiaque.




Les maladies cardiaques


Le cœur, nous l’avons dit, fonctionne comme une pompe électrique; il peut donc être sujet à deux types
de panne:
          •   les pannes électriques, qui peuvent entre autres raisons être liées à une nécrose (mort
              cellulaire) d’une partie du muscle cardiaque (infarctus du myocarde)
          •   les pannes mécaniques: fuites (insuffisance valvulaire), baisse de puissance
              (cardiomyopathies).


Ces pathologies existent chez le chien comme chez l’homme, mais pas avec la même fréquence:




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                   31
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                         06/06/2008



       o    la pathologie la plus courante chez le chien est représentée par les atteintes valvulaires,
            notamment sur la valve mitrale (entre l’oreillette gauche et le ventricule gauche); l’affection
            entraîné une perte d’étanchéité, ainsi on observe une fuite qui remonte dans l’oreillette et
            s’entend à l’auscultation (souffle cardiaque). L’évolution va vers le développement plus ou
            moins tardif d’un œdème pulmonaire, qui est une urgence grave.
       o    en médecine humaine, une pathologie très fréquente est l’infarctus du myocarde; en
            quelques mots, cette affection est due à l’obstruction d’une artère coronaire, ce qui conduit à
            la nécrose de la zone irriguée sur le cœur par cette artère. Cette pathologie est quasiment
            absente chez le chien, et ce pour deux raisons essentielles: d’une part, l’artériosclérose,
            maladie due en partie à l’excès de cholestérol et responsable de l’infarctus du myocarde,
            n’existe pas en médecine canine; d’autre part, chaque territoire du coeur est irrigué par
            plusieurs artères coronaires, ce qui n’est pas le cas chez l’Homme, et ce qui offre des voies de
            secours en cas de défaillance. Ainsi, le chien ne meurt pas d’infarctus du myocarde !
       o    les accidents électriques causent des troubles du rythme cardiaque; un nombre conséquent
            de troubles du rythme est dû en pathologie humaine à l’infarctus ou à des troubles de la
            circulation coronaire, ce qui est rare chez le chien comme nous l’avons vu. Il peut toutefois
            exister des troubles du rythme d’autre origine, responsables parfois de syncopes.

Les examens en pathologie cardiaque
Les examens à mettre en oeuvre seront bien évidemment fonction de la pathologie en cause; c’est au
départ l’examen clinique, et en particulier l’auscultation qui vont guider le choix du praticien.


La radiologie est l’examen le plus important en pathologie cardiaque: il permet d’évaluer la forme et le
volume du coeur, mais aussi de voir les conséquences de l’insuffisance cardiaque sur la circulation
pulmonaire; c’est primordial pour mesurer les risques de développement d’un oedème pulmonaire,
évolution fatale de l’insuffisance cardiaque.


L’électrocardiographie sert principalement dans la détection des troubles du rythme cardiaque, mais
permet aussi d’évaluer les dilatations cavitaires, et, en médecine humaine, de mesurer l’importance de
l’étendue d’un infarctus du myocarde.


L’échographie reste l’instrument de choix dans l’étude des mouvements : on peut ainsi voir les valves en
mouvement, mesurer la dilatation des cavités, ou l’épaisseur des parois; en associant le doppler, on peut
même quantifier les fuites liées aux insuffisances valvulaires. Cette technique a incontestablement
révolutionné l’approche de la cardiologie, mais elle reste d’un maniement assez délicat pour pouvoir être
correctement interprétée.


La mesure de la tension est difficile chez nos carnivores pour des raisons anatomiques; on peut y arriver
en utilisant des techniques de doppler, mais ce n’est pas de pratique courante.

Les traitements de l’insuffisance cardiaque
Rappelons que l’insuffisance cardiaque est due soit à l’incontinence d’une valve (fuite), soit à une
maladie musculaire qui effondre la puissance de contraction du coeur.
Face à ce type de pathologie, on peut changer toute ou partie de la pompe; c’est ce que l’on pratique dans
les cas graves en chirurgie humaine, mais reste hors de portée pour nos animaux.




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                    32
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                       06/06/2008



On ne peut donc qu’améliorer les conditions de circulation; pour cela, on va utiliser principalement des
vasodilatateurs (qui augmentent le calibre des vaisseaux): on comprend en effet aisément que le sang
aura plus de facilité à circuler dans des tuyaux plus gros, ce qui va soulager le travail de la pompe
cardiaque.


Ces traitements ont nettement amélioré la qualité et l’espérance de vie de nos carnivores domestiques;
ainsi dans l’insuffisance mitrale, on peut prolonger la vie de l’animal de plusieurs années dans des
conditions tout à fait satisfaisantes, au prix d’un traitement permanent.


Dans les phases aiguës (oedème du poumon par exemple) , on pourra adjoindre des diurétiques, mais
ces médicaments ne constituent pas le traitement de fond de l’insuffisance cardiaque.

Conclusion: importance du dépistage
Le plus important dans des maladies chroniques comme l’insuffisance cardiaque est d’éviter que la
situation ne se dégrade trop. Les traitements sont d’autant plus efficaces qu’ils sont mis en place
précocement.


C’est pourquoi votre vétérinaire prend soin chaque année à l’occasion de la visite vaccinale de pratiquer
une auscultation cardiaque soignée, à la recherche d’un éventuel souffle qui pourrait révéler une
insuffisance cardiaque. On ne soulignera jamais assez que la visite annuelle représente bien plus que la
vaccination, mais bien un dépistage des maladies susceptibles de survenir chez le chien vieillissant.

Les gastro-entérites du chien
Comment se manifeste une gastro-entérite ?
Une gastrite est l'inflammation de l'estomac; sa traduction symptomatiquement est représentée par les
vomissements.


Une entérite est l'inflammation de l'intestin; sa traduction symptomatologique est représentée par la
diarrhée. La gastro-entérite est une association des deux et se traduit par vomissements et diarrhée.

Dans quels cas se méfier d'une gastro-entérite?
    •   Si les symptômes durent plus de 24 heures;
    •   Si l'état général de l'animal est altéré (grosse fatigue);
    •   Dès qu'il y a du sang dans les vomissements et les selles (couleur rouge ou noire);
    •   S'il y a une fièvre importante (la température rectale normale est de 38 - 38°5 chez les
        carnivores en temps normal);
    •   Si les symptômes persistent et surtout s'ils s'aggravent alors qu'un traitement a été mis en
        place.

Quelles sont les premières mesures à prendre?
    •   Mettre le tube digestif au repos pendant 24 à 36 heures:
    •   Diète, rien à manger;
    •   Rationner l'eau: peu à la fois (maxi 1/2 verre pour un grand chien); si besoin arrêter de donner à
        boire si l'animal persiste à vomir: un animal se déshydrate plus s'il vomit que s'il ne vomit pas,
        même sans boisson;

FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                          06/06/2008



    •   Interdiction de manger de l'herbe ou autres (poubelles!): garder l'animal à l'intérieur.
    •   Reprise progressive de l'alimentation: une petite boulette puis 1/4 de repas puis un demi-
        repas…

C'est grave, docteur?
Les vomissements sont "faciles" chez les carnivores; ces animaux ayant un régime parfois "blessant" (os,
entre autres), la nature a prévu cette soupape de sécurité. Pour autant, il ne faut jamais négliger
l'importance de ce symptôme s'il persiste: la déshydratation survient très vite avec les vomissements (48
heures chez un animal adulte), et elle peut être rapidement mortelle. De plus, le vomissement peut être
le signe d'une affection plus grave qu'une simple gastrite (occlusion intestinale, hépatite, crise d'urée,
torsion de l'estomac…).


Les diarrhées sont également fréquentes; cela est dû en partie à la faible longueur de l'intestin chez les
carnivores par opposition aux herbivores. Là aussi, une diarrhée persistante doit alerter le propriétaire;
ce peut être le signe de problèmes moins aigus, mais également graves (tumeur de l'intestin, problème
de sécrétions digestives en sont des exemples).


Donc pour tout trouble bizarre ou suraigu ou persistant, n'hésitez pas à prendre conseil auprès d'un
vétérinaire: il vaut mieux un coup de fil de sécurité qu'une urgence en plein milieu de la nuit!

La Leishmaniose

Qu’est-ce que la leishmaniose?
La leishmaniose est une maladie du chien due à un micro-organisme, la leishmanie , parasitant
habituellement l’ensemble du système lymphatique, la rate et la mœlle osseuse (système réticulo-
histiocytaire).


La leishmanie est inoculée au chien par une minuscule mouche piqueuse, le Phlébotome, dont l’habitat
est très bien défini, ce qui explique la localisation précise de la maladie: la leishmaniose en France est
cantonnée principalement au littoral méditerranéen ; de même, elle sévira plus fréquemment dans
certaines communes, simplement parce que le Phlébotome y est plus présent.


Le Phlébotome n’est actif qu’entre mai et septembre: c’est à cette époque qu’il transmet la maladie, en
piquant le chien, le soir, lors de son repas de sang.

Comment se manifeste-t-elle?
De façon très variable : les symptômes de la leishmaniose ne sont pas constants.


Cependant, les signes les plus courants sont la chute de poils, principalement autour des yeux
(”lunettes”), avec développement de pellicules sur tout le corps, l’amaigrissement (les 2 signes conjoints
donnent au chien un aspect de vieux animal), la fatigabilité et l’augmentation de taille des ganglions
lymphatiques.

FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                           06/06/2008



Plus rarement on observe des ulcérations cutanées qui ne guérissent pas, des saignements de nez qui
peuvent être extrêmement spectaculaires, des boiteries et un allongement des ongles.


Il existe également une atteinte des reins dans la leishmaniose; ceci peut entraîner le développement
d’un syndrome urémique mortel pour l’animal.
Quelque soit sa forme, la leishmaniose est une maladie d’évolution lente et insidieuse, en dehors de
l’apparition brutale d’un saignement de nez. Il est parfois difficile pour le propriétaire qui vit tous les
jours avec son chien de se rendre compte de la dégradation de l’état de son animal.

La leishmaniose est-elle contagieuse du chien à l’homme?
Non. La leishmaniose humaine existe; si elle est rare en France, elle est par contre plus courante dans
les pays tropicaux. De toutes façons elle n’est pas transmise par le chien, mais par le Phlébotome qui
représente seul l’élément ”dangereux”. Il n’est donc pas fondé de faire procéder à l’euthanasie de son
chien par crainte de contagion.

Existe-t-il des moyens de protection contre le leishmaniose?
Actuellement il n’existe aucun vaccin. Des études sont en cours , mais il ne faut pas attendre le
commercialisation avant quelques années.


On peut par contre essayer d’agir sur le Phlébotome : s’il paraît illusoire d’enfermer le chien les soirs
d’été pour lui éviter le contact avec le Phlébotome (surtout dans les régions méditerranéennes où sévit
la maladie et où l’on vit fenêtres ouvertes l’été...), on peut par contre adapter sur le chien certains
colliers insecticides ayant un pouvoir répulsif sur les insectes, mais cela ne confère pas une protection
absolue.



Peut-on traiter la leishmaniose?
Oui, avec certaines réserves:
    •   Il faut en priorité que la fonction rénale d’un chien leishmanien ne soit pas gravement
        perturbée, sans quoi le pronostic devient franchement mauvais (contrôle par prise de sang
        indispensable avant la mise en route du traitement).
    •   Il faut également savoir que le traitement existant ne détruit pas totalement les leishmanies.
        Cela implique de traiter le chien tout au long de sa vie, sinon des rechutes sont inévitables. Si la
        sérolgie reste positive au bout d’un an de traitement, le chien doit être considéré comme un
        malade chronique et traité régulièrement (en continu avec une injection par mois, ou en fonction
        de son évolution clinique).


De plus le traitement de la maladie ne se fait que par piqûres (injections sous-cutanées pratiquées par
le propriétaire).


Malgré ces réserves, on peut dire que le traitement de la leishmaniose donne d’excellents résultats, avec
des survies de plusieurs années.


Il existe cependant un cas particulier où la prudence s’impose: les atteintes oculaires de la leishmaniose
sont très difficiles à contrôler, et, si elles ne mettent pas en jeu la vie de l’animal, elles peuvent

compliquent le traitement de la maladie.

La Piroplasmose
La piroplasmose ou babésiose canine est une maladie régionale due à la prolifération dans les globules
rouges du chien d'un parasite entraînant leur destruction et pouvant conduire à la mort en l'absence de
traitement.


La piroplasmose est cosmopolite et touche de nombreux pays d'Europe (Suisse, Allemagne, Angleterre,
Danemark, Belgique, Hollande...), d'Asie et d'Amérique (Brésil, sud des Etats-Unis...). Le parasite étant
transmis par morsure de Tique, la maladie ne peut se développer que dans les régions ou pays où vivent
ces acariens: en France métropolitaine, ce sont surtout les régions du Sud-Ouest, du Centre, et une
partie du Val de Loire qui sont touchées; par contre, la babésiose est pratiquement absente du Sud-Est.
C'est une maladie à forte incidence saisonnière: on observe le plus de cas au printemps et en automne,
beaucoup moins en été et pratiquement pas en saison froide.


Toutes les races de chiens sont sensibles à la piroplasmose, et la maladie est plus fréquente chez les
jeunes entre 3 mois et 2 ans; plus tard, il semble qu'une certaine immunité se développe et protège
partiellement les animaux plus âgés.


L'incubation de la piroplasmose est brève (4 à 6 jours); la maladie se déclare habituellement par une
forte poussée de fièvre (jusqu'à 41°), ce qui entraîne un abattement important et une perte d'appétit. Il
existe parfois des difficultés locomotrices (boiteries). La couleur des urines se modifie rapidement (cela
est dû à la destruction des globules rouges, ce qui entraîne la libération de l'hémoglobine dans le sang;
ce pigment est éliminé par le rein et se retouve dans les urines): la teinte passe au jaune foncé, et peut
aller jusqu'à la couleur café noir (danger!).


Si l'hémolyse (éclatement des hématies ou globules rouges) est suffisamment marquée, un ictère
(jaunisse) va se développer. La couleur des muqueuses du chien (gencives, conjonctive) vire au jaune
pâle. De plus, l'animal pouvant être fortement anémié, des difficultés respiratoires font leur apparition
(essoufflement).


La piroplasmose est le plus souvent une maladie d'évolution courte (2 à 4 jours), qui peut rapidement
mettre un chien en danger. N'hésitez pas à consulter un vétérinaire si vous vous trouvez dans une zone
à risque, au printemps ou en automne, et si votre chien présente des signes évocateurs. Les
complications sur un animal non traité sont redoutables, notamment l'atteinte rénale qui peut être
irréversible et fatale ("crise d'urée").


Le diagnostic en phase aiguë est assez simple; il suffit pour le vétérinaire de constater la présence du
parasite dans le sang; pour cela un simple examen microscopique d'une goutte de sang (examen de
routine réalisé en consultation) permet d'apporter la confirmation de la maladie.




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                   36
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                          06/06/2008



Le traitement fait appel à l'administration d'un antiparasitaire spécifique par injection. Sous réserve
que la maladie n'ait pas touché le rein (contrôle par prise de sang fortement recommandé), le pronostic
est bon et la guérison spectaculaire (animal en forme quelques heures après l'injection).


La prévention de la babésiose est possible selon 3 modalités:
         •   La vaccination est disponible, mais l'efficacité de la vaccination - par ailleurs coûteuse - est
             assez moyenne. Elle n'est pas utile pour les chiens ne séjournant pas de façon continue en
             zone à risque;
         •   La prévention de l'infestation par les tiques donne de meilleurs résultats: il existe chez les
             vétérinaires des colliers anitiques donnant toute satisfaction (certains sont d'ailleurs
             strictement acaricides et ne traitent pas les puces, cette spécificité est souvent une garantie
             d'efficacité); la durée de protection est selon les produits de 4 à 6 mois.
         •   Une chimio-prévention - très efficace - est également possible; elle s'adresse aux animaux
             qui séjournent relativement peu de temps ( moins d'un mois) en zone à risque. Dans ce but,
             une injection est pratiquée par un vétérinaire sur l'animal peu avant son départ, la durée de
             protection est de 4 semaines.

La Rage
Maladie virale, connue depuis l’antiquité, et réapparue en France depuis mars 1968, la rage reste à ce
jour la plus dangereuse des maladies commune à l’homme et aux animaux; c’est pourquoi elle fait l’objet
d’une surveillance stricte dans tous les pays, et plus particulièrement sur notre territoire.


Actuellement en forte régression en France grâce à de multiples campagnes de vaccination des renards,
principaux vecteurs de la maladie, la rage ne concerne plus aujourd’hui que 5 départements: Bas-Rhin,
Moselle, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse et Ardennes (situation au 1/09/99). Le dernier cas de rage connu en
France remonte au mois de novembre 1998. La maladie tue encore 40 000 personnes par an dans le
monde.


Chez l’animal, la rage peut atteindre toutes les espèces de mammifères. Le renard est en Europe le
principal vecteur de la maladie, mais c’est le chien qui représente le plus grand danger de
contamination pour l’homme (85% des cas). Pour mémoire, le renard couvre en France 80% des cas de
rage, les bovins 10%, le chien 3% et le chat 2%. En Amérique du Sud, certaines chauves-souris sont
capables de transmettre la rage, ce qui est beaucoup plus difficile à contrôler…


Chez l’homme, aucun cas de rage n’a été observé en France du fait d’une contamination animale depuis
1968, ce qui montre l’efficacité des moyens de surveillance. C’est d’ailleurs heureux, car la maladie est
systématiquement mortelle du moment que les symptômes ont commencé à apparaître.


D’un point de vue clinique, la rage est une maladie qui touche le système nerveux en provoquant des
modifications comportementales allant jusqu’à l’extrême agressivité (rage furieuse), et évoluant vers la
paralysie, localisée (c’est la paralysie des muscles masticateurs qui, en empêchant la déglutition,
provoque la salivation) ou généralisée (paralysie “ascendante” commençant par les membres




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                      37
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                          06/06/2008



postérieurs/inférieurs puis remontant jusqu’à paralyser le diaphragme…). La maladie évolue
rapidement, sur 4 à 8 jours. Chez l’homme, la conscience est conservée jusqu’à la fin.


Cette rapidité d’évolution contraste avec la grande longueur de l’incubation (période s’écoulant entre le
moment de la contamination - le plus souvent par morsure - et le début des symptômes). Ce délai peut
aller jusqu’à plusieurs mois, il est habituellement de 3 à 8 semaines; il s’explique par le mode de
propagation du virus, qui contrairement à ce qui se passe habituellement n’est pas véhiculé par le sang,
mais remonte lentement le long des nerfs jusqu’aux centres nerveux: mœlle épinière et cerveau. Le
virus diffusera ensuite dans les glandes salivaires, et se retrouvera dans la salive 3 à 5 jours avant
l’apparition des premiers symptômes, permettant ainsi la contamination par morsure.


La longueur de l’incubation est mise a profit dans le traitement antirabique (après une morsure
contaminante). Il est possible de pratiquer une vaccination pendant la période d’incubation, l’immunité
se développant avant l’apparition des symptômes. Mais cela suppose de savoir que la morsure a pu
transmettre le virus. C’est pourquoi les législations des divers pays ont mis en place une surveillance
obligatoire des animaux mordeurs.


La surveillance clinique des animaux suspects reste le moyen le plus sensible et le plus rapide à mettre
en œuvre pour déterminer si un animal est enragé. Elle repose sur la constatation suivante: l’excrétion
du virus rabique chez un animal enragé ne commence jamais plus de 12 jours avant sa mort. En France,
la législation a donc prévu une période de surveillance de 15 jours (délai de sécurité, supérieur à 12
jours), pendant laquelle l’animal mordeur est soumis à 3 visites chez un vétérinaire (dans les 24h
suivant la morsure, puis le 7è jour et le 15è jour). Si à l’issue de cette période de 15 jours l’animal est
toujours vivant, c’est qu’il n’est certainement pas enragé. S’il meurt au cours de la période de
surveillance, des analyses sont pratiquées sur son cerveau (recherche de virus), et dans la plupart des
cas, un traitement antirabique sera instauré sur la personne mordue.


La vaccination antirabique des carnivores se pratique en une injection, avec rappel annuel. Le certificat
de vaccination est valable un mois après une injection de primovaccination, immédiatement après une
injection de rappel, et jusqu’à un an après l’injection. La loi française rend la vaccination contre la rage
obligatoire dans les cas suivants:


        •   Voyage à l’étranger
        •   Départements déclarés infectés (08, 54, 55, 57, 67)
        •   Corse et Outre-Mer;
        •   Séjour en camping;
        •   Présentation en exposition canine ou féline
        •   Chiens d’attaque, de défense et de garde visés par la loi du 30 avril 1999: Pittbull, Boerbull,
            Tosa, Staffordhire terrier et apparentés, Rottweiler et apparentés.

Les tumeurs mammaires chez la chienne
Les tumeurs de la mamelle sont les plus fréquentes des tumeurs canines (50% des tumeurs de la
chienne): c'est une pathologie fréquente qu'il importe de repérer et de traiter le plus précocement




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                      38

possible, car 20 à 40% de ces tumeurs sont cancéreuses, et les chances de guérison sont d'autant plus
grandes que le traitement est instauré précocement.


Les tumeurs mammaires apparaissent rarement avant l'âge de 2 ans, mais se développent plutôt après
8 ans. Toute grosseur suspecte au niveau des chaînes mammaires doit donc amener à consulter; chez la
chienne, ce sont les mamelles postérieures qui sont le plus souvent atteintes.


Il est généralement impossible de différencier les tumeurs bénignes des tumeurs cancéreuses par le seul
examen clinique: il est donc plus sage de faire procéder le plus tôt possible au retrait chirurgicale des
lésions observées. Il est très important de faire analyser ces tumeurs après leur éxérèse (analyse
histologique en laboratoire spécialisé), car la nature de la tumeur commande le pronostic: l'analyse va
en particulier renseigner sur la nature d'une tumeur (bénigne ou cancéreuse), ainsi que sur le grade
d'une tumeur cancéreuse, c'est à dire sur la capacité de multiplication des cellules malignes (agressivité
de la tumeur); on connaîtra ainsi le risque de récidive locale ou d'extension à distance (métastases), ce
qui est crucial pour adopter une attitude face à une éventuelle récidive.


L'importance du traitement chirurgical dépend de la grosseur de la tumeur, du caractère unique ou
multiple des lésions, et de la situation sur la chaîne mammaire; votre vétérinaire sera à même de vous
préciser la technique utilisée en fonction des cas. La chirurgie est toujours indispensable pour traiter
une tumeur mammaire: sans cure chirurgicale, la tumeur va toujours grandir (plus ou moins vite selon
son agressivité), et ne disparaîtra jamais, quelque soit le traitement médical utilisé.
Après la chirurgie, il peut être conseillé d'utiliser les traitements complémentaires classiques en
cancérologie (radiothérapie et/ou chimiothérapie anticancéreuse): outre leur lourdeur, force est de
reconnaître que le bénéfice apporté est souvent mince en comparaison des effets secondaires: la décision
sera prise après une discussion avec le praticien.


La prévention des tumeurs mammaires chez la chienne repose sur la stérilisation précoce (avant les
premières chaleurs si possible; aucune diminution de fréquence d'apparition n'est constatée quand la
stérilisation intervient après 2 ans 1/2). Après stérilisation précoce, le risque de tumeurs de la mamelle
chute dans des proportions de 1/200! Par contre l'usage des progestatifs (pilule) augmente le risque.
Cela confirme le fait que la stérilisation chirurgicale est une méthode bien préférable à l'utilisation de la
pilule dans la contraception canine.

L’épilepsie chez le chien
L'épilepsie "essentielle", c'est à dire survenant sans cause particulière chez un sujet prédisposé,
apparaît chez le jeune adulte (entre 1 et 4 ans), avec des préférences pour certaines races dont le
labrador fait partie.


Une crise typique se déroule en trois phases:
        ❱   Préliminaire: le chien sent qu'il va se passer quelque chose, se cache ou au contraire se
            rapproche de ses maîtres. A la longue, les propriétaires repèrent ce comportement et savent
            que la crise va se déclencher




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                    39
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                         06/06/2008



        ❱   Crise proprement dite, en deux phases: la première, "tonique": le chien se raidit (contraction
            de toues les muscles extenseurs, pattes tendues, tête rejetée en arrière) et tombe au sol; la
            deuxième "clonique" ou des spasmes musculaires s'étendent tout le corps, notamment aux
            pattes (l'animal semble courir alors qu'il est couché sur le coté) et aux muscles masticateurs
            (claque des dents, d'ou une importante salivation). La crise dure entre une et trois minutes
        ❱   Phase de récupération: le chien prend une profonde inspiration, se calme, semble dormir
            (moins d'une minute en général), puis se redresse et c'est fini: une des caractéristiques de
            l'épilepsie c'est que le chien est tout à fait normal avant et après la crise.


Voila pour la crise dite "de grand mal". Mais entre ce type de crise et des crises presque sans symptômes
(juste des pertes d'équilibre par exemple), tous les intermédiaires sont possibles.


Comme certains facteurs (hypoglycémie et hypocalcémie en particulier) peuvent renforcer la probabilité
de crises d'épilepsie, il convient de réaliser un bilan hématobiochimique assez large pour éliminer ces
causes. Si tout est normal, il s'agit bien d'épilepsie essentielle.


Le traitement de référence reste le phénobarbital (Gardénal*). Les autres produits sont moins efficaces
et plus toxiques au long terme. La mise en place du traitement est délicate, il importe de mesurer la
concentration du phénobarbital dans le sang pour vérifier qu'on se trouve bien dans l'intervalle
thérapeutique (prise de sang après une semaine de traitement).


Le traitement est poursuivi toute la vie de l'animal chez les épileptiques vrais, avec contrôle de l'état du
foie (transaminase ALT et phosphatases) tous les 3 à 6 mois.

Le diabète chez le chien
Le diabète est une maladie grave se traduisant par l’augmentation du taux de glucose dans le sang; les
symptômes sont l’augmentation de la soif, de l’appétit et de la diurèse (quantité d’urines émise). Les
femelles sont statistiquement beaucoup plus atteintes que les mâles (75% contre 25 %).


La maladie évolue en l’absence de traitement vers l’amaigrissement et la mort.


Le diagnostic repose en partie sur la mise en évidence d’une glycémie élevée (taux de glucose sanguin).


Le traitement chez le chien fait systématiquement appel aux injections d’insuline; cette hormone
sécrétée par le pancréas, est déficitaire chez le sujet diabétique, et doit être injectée une à deux fois par
jour, à vie. Les médicaments par voie orale sont inutilisables chez les carnivores domestiques.


La mise en place de l’insulinothérapie doit s’accompagner de précautions préalables indispensables:
dans l’ordre:


    1. Bilan hématologique et biochimique complets (pour déceler une éventuelle cause
        infectieuse - rare - et mesurer les conséquences de la maladie sur tous les organes);

    2. Bilan urinaire: mesure de la densité et recherche d’une infection urinaire;
    3. Mise en place de l’insulinothérapie: injection sous-cutanée réalisée à heure fixe le matin par le
        propriétaire.
    4. Régime alimentaire strict; le meilleur moyen - et le plus commode - consiste à utiliser un
        aliment à objectif spécial, destiné au chien diabétique. Repas 2 fois par jour à heures fixes, au
        moment de l’injection puis 7 heures après.
    5. Stérilisation obligatoire chez la femelle: le cycle ovarien induit d’importantes variations du
        taux de glucose, et entraîne des résistances à l’insuline; il est impossible de stabiliser le diabète
        d’une chienne/chatte non stérilisée.
    6. Réalisation d’une courbe de glycémie: hospitalisation 12 heures et prises de sang (7) pour
        mesurer l’évolution du taux de glucose dans le sang sur 12 heures. Ces analyses permettent de
        savoir si l’animal métabolise normalement l’insuline, et si une seule injection par jour est
        suffisante.
    7. Surveillance quotidienne des urines pour vérifier l’adaptation de la dose d’insuline aux
        besoins du chien; au début ce test est fait tous les jours par le propriétaire, puis on espace
        progressivement les contrôles quand l’animal est stabilisé.
Ces différentes contraintes ont évidemment un coût... mais la survie de l’animal est à ce prix; On ne
guérit pas un diabète, on ne fait que réajuster artificiellement le taux d’insuline manquante.

Votre animal vieillit, les points à surveiller
Vieillesse ne doit pas être synonyme de mauvaise santé !


Si le vieillissement de l'organisme se traduit par des modifications progressives mais irréversibles, la
connaissance de certains signes d'appel permet de mettre en place une prévention efficace qui permet
d'améliorer la santé, la longévité et la qualité de vie de votre animal.

A partir de quel âge doit-on considérer qu'un animal vieillit ?
Plus l'animal est de petite race, plus il vit vieux.

Le système digestif
Les dents s'usent progressivement avec l'âge et surtout ont tendance à se recouvrir de tartre (surtout
visible sur les incisives inférieures et les molaires supérieures). Le dépôt de tartre permet
l'implantation de bactéries qui, trouvant dans la bouche des conditions d'humidité et de chaleur
propices à leur développement, provoquent des fermentations responsables de l'odeur fétide de l'haleine.


Ces bactéries peuvent également être responsables d'infections à distance, notamment sur les reins
(glomérulo-néphrite) et sur le coeur (endocardite). Le problème est donc loin d'être mineur et peut se
résoudre en faisant détartrer son animal (anesthésie générale de courte durée). Un traitement
d'entretien peut par la suite retarder le dépôt de tartre.


A surveiller: le dépôt de tartre

FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                          06/06/2008



Le système cardio-respiratoire
La toux est une symptôme fréquent chez le chien âgé; dans certains cas elle est bénigne ( fibrose
pulmonaire due à une diminution d'élasticité des petites bronches), dans d'autres cas , elle peut être le
signe d'une insuffisance cardiaque: la pompe cardiaque fonctionnant de façon moins efficace chez
certains chiens âgés (plus rarement chez le chat), la pression sanguine à la sortie du coeur est plus
faible et le coeur répond moins bien aux sollicitations (efforts). Soyez donc attentif au développement
d'une toux sur un animal qui se fatigue vite, surtout si on vous a signalé auparavant l'existence d'un
souffle cardiaque. Curieusement, la toux cardiaque se manifeste surtout quand l'animal est au repos
(nuit, sieste de l'après-midi), car la position couchée ne favorise pas une bonne circulation dans les
vaisseaux pulmonaires.


Un examen cardio-respiratoire complet (auscultation, radiographie, éventuellement
électrocardiogramme) permettra de dresser un état des lieux avant de mettre en place un traitement.


A surveiller: la toux au repos

L'appareil urinaire
Le rein vieillit mal chez les carnivores. La capacité de filtration, qui est la principale fonction du rein,
diminue progressivement avec l'âge, ainsi certaines substances fabriquées par l'organisme pourront être
moins facilement éliminées. Le phénomène reste longtemps inapparent, même avec des examens
poussés, car le rein dispose de nombreuses unités de filtration en réserve. Le premier signe perceptible
pour le propriétaire est l'augmentation de la quantité d'eau bue par l'animal: en effet la capacité de
concentration des urines est touchée en premier sur un rein insuffisant.


Dans un deuxième temps - parfois quelques années plus tard- la capacité d'élimination du rein est à son
tour altérée: à ce stade, l’urée, produit naturel de la dégradation des protéines par l'organisme, est
rejetée en moins grande quantité dans l'urine et son taux sanguin monte: c'est le début de la "crise
d'urémie", problème qui peut être fatal sans traitement approprié...


A surveiller: l'animal qui boit plus que d'habitude

L'appareil locomoteur
L'arthrose touche de nombreux animaux âgés. Certaines races, notamment le Berger Allemand, sont
particulièrement atteintes. L'arthrose est une dégénérescence du tissu cartilagineux entraînant des
poussées inflammatoires qui peuvent être très douloureuses (crises de rhumatisme). Chez le chien,
l'arrière-train est le plus touché, ce qui donne des difficultés au relever et une démarche louvoyante. Les
anti-inflammatoires traitent bien la douleur. Prudence chez le chat: l'aspirine demande des doses bien
adaptées, et le paracétamol (Efféralgan, Doliprane...) est un médicament très dangereux dans cette
espèce.


A surveiller: la démarche raide et le relever difficile

Les tumeurs
D'expression très variable, les tumeurs vont de la petite verrue à laquelle on ne touche pas sauf si elle
est mal placée (paupière), jusqu'aux tumeurs mammaires multiples avec extension sur d'autres organes
(métastases). Sont à surveiller particulièrement :




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                       42
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                         06/06/2008




    -   Chez la femelle, les tumeurs mammaires, première cause d'intervention chirurgicale chez la
        chienne âgée. Tout nodule, toute grosseur doit être signalée le plus tôt possible. Règle générale
        concernant les tumeurs: personne ne peut dire de façon formelle si telle tumeur est cancéreuse
        (et donc menace l'ensemble de l'organisme) ou non; tout au plus peut on émettre un avis
        statistique en se référant à son expérience ou à des comparaisons. Le seul moyen de connaître la
        nature d'une tumeur est de la soumettre à analyse après l'avoir enlevée chirurgicalement. Ne
        préjugez jamais de la nature d'une tumeur, d'autant que certaines d'entre elles, et notamment
        les tumeurs mammaires, sont susceptibles d'évoluer dans le temps (certaines tumeurs bénignes
        peuvent devenir cancéreuses au bout de quelques mois).


    -   Chez le mâle de plus de 11 ans, les tumeurs autour de l'anus: elles peuvent devenir
        envahissantes et se mettre à saigner.


    -   Dans les deux sexes, un amaigrissement rapide avec conservation de l'appétit, des chutes
        importantes de poils sans démangeaison, la persistance ou la récidive d'un symptôme malgré le
        traitement mis en place peuvent faire penser à un processus tumoral évolutif. L'animal âgé
        demande souvent une surveillance plus attentive de la part de ses propriétaires.


A surveiller: toute grosseur suspecte

Les yeux
Les chats connaissent rarement des problèmes oculaires en vieillissant. Certaines races de chiens, en
particulier le Caniche, le Cocker, les Setters et le Labrador, peuvent développer une cataracte sénile,
opacification du cristallin conduisant progressivement à la cécité. Dans cette affection, la pupille semble
se voiler peu à peu car le cristallin qui est situé derrière devient de moins en moins transparent, puis
blanc et opaque. Il n'existe malheureusement aucun moyen d'empêcher l'évolution d'une cataracte, mais
l'opération est possible comme chez l'être humain.


A surveiller: le regard "voilé"

Son alimentation
Avec l’âge, les besoins en énergie diminuent: attention à l'obésité! Le transit intestinal se ralentit, le
régime devrait être plus riche en fibres. Plus que les quantités respectives de tel ou tel composant, c'est
leur qualité qui permettra une meilleure assimilation ainsi qu'une élimination facile (des protéines de
bonne qualité produiront moins de déchets azotés donc moins d'urée...). Des aliments sous forme de
boîtes ou de croquettes (plus économiques) spécialement adaptés aux besoins des animaux âgés
existent; ils vous permettront de prévenir l'apparition de nombreux problèmes, et même dans certains
cas d'aider au traitement (aliments pour animaux à insuffisance cardiaque ou à insuffisance rénale par
exemple).


A surveiller : la qualité de l'alimentation


Un bilan de santé annuel, pratiqué par exemple lors de la vaccination, est la meilleure façon de vous
assurer de la bonne santé de votre animal.

A cette occasion, votre vétérinaire pourra sur votre demande pratiquer les examens utiles: prise de
sang, analyse d'urine, radiologie, bilan cardiaque


Source : http://www.veteriweb.com

Quand faire un bilan de santé à votre chien

Quand ?
   A l'occasion d'un problème de santé: il est évident que toute consultation chez un vétérinaire, à
    l'instar de ce qui se passe en médecine humaine, ne s'accompagne pas d'un bilan hématologique,
    radiologique ou autre. Néanmoins, certains cas vont souvent amener votre vétérinaire à proposer
    des examens complémentaires: amaigrissement brutal ou soif anormale par exemple; c'est d'ailleurs
    dans les cas chroniques, où les maladies évoluent lentement et parfois avec peu de symptômes, que
    l'apport des examens complémentaires est le plus profitable.
   En dépistage: la médecine vétérinaire a suivi l'évolution de la médecine humaine en passant d'une
    médecine curative (le soin d'une affection au moment où elle apparaît) à une médecine préventive
    (essai de dépistage précoce avant l'apparition de symptômes cliniques). Cette façon de procéder
    apporte des bénéfices considérables dans l'amélioration des conditions de vie, mais elle a un coût
    certain. Il est conseillé de faire procéder à un bilan sanguin vers 7 - 8 ans puis tous les ans, à
    l'occasion de la visite vaccinale par exemple, si on veut anticiper sur les problèmes susceptibles de
    se présenter: ainsi la surveillance de l'urée et de la créatinine sanguines, ainsi qu'un simple examen
    urinaire permettent-ils de déceler un début d'usure rénale, et le cas échéant, de prévenir la
    survenue d'une "crise d'urée".
   Pour le suivi d'une pathologie: l'évolution des chiffres permet de préciser le pronostic ou d'adapter le
    traitement (cas des animaux diabétiques).



Quels examens privilégier ?
Le choix des examens complémentaires revient bien sûr au vétérinaire traitant, qui déterminera en
fonction de l'examen clinique de l'animal quels paramètres il voudra examiner. On peut toutefois
admettre que les examens à réaliser sont fonction de l'appareil touché:
   Pour l'appareil respiratoire, la radiographie reste le meilleur moyen;
   Pour l'appareil urinaire, l'examen des urines (bandelette urinaire et densité) doit souvent être
    associé à des mesures sanguines (en particulier urée et créatinine, mais aussi sodium, potassium,
    phosphore …);
   Pour la cardiologie, la radiologie couplée à l'échographie sont les examens de choix; le recours à
    l'électrocardiogramme, bien que riche en enseignements, est beaucoup plus restreint qu'en
    médecine humaine;
   Pour le tube digestif, la radiologie sera utilement associée aux examens sanguins; l'échographie du
    foie, délicate à interpréter, est précieuse;
   Les maladies fébriles sont une bonne indication pour la réalisation d'une hématologie (numération
    des globules rouges et blancs, comptage des plaquettes, étude de la morphologie de ces cellules sur
    frottis sanguin);
   Les problèmes locomoteurs donneront souvent lieu à la réalisation de radiographies. Ne soyez pas
    surpris si votre vétérinaire vous propose de réaliser les clichés sous anesthésie générale, les
    animaux sont souvent peu coopératifs pour garder la pause qui permettrait la réalisation de clichés




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                    44
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                        06/06/2008



    interprétables! L'anesthésie est ainsi indispensable pour la réalisation d'un cliché correct du crâne,
    des hanches ou de la colonne vertébrale.
   Certains organes ne peuvent être examinés qu'avec des moyens lourds: c'est le cas du cerveau, pour
    lequel seuls le scanner ou l'IRM permettent de déceler des modifications éventuelles.
        •     Dans certains cas, des faisceaux de renseignements seront nécessaires: s'agissant d'un
              animal qui maigrit, par exemple, le bilan pourrait être:
   Prise de sang : hématologie, biochimie, sérologies en vue de la recherche de certaines maladies
    (ehrlichiose ou leishmaniose dans les régions concernées par exemple);
   Contrôle urinaire: recherche de protéines;
   Radiologie thoracique à la recherche d'une éventuelle tumeur;
   Recherche de parasites intestinaux par coproscopie (examen de selles);
   Échographie abdominale (hépatique) pour recherche de tumeur;


… et cette liste n'est pas limitative, le résultat de certains examens pouvant amener d'autres
recherches!


Le praticien devra donc, en accord avec le propriétaire, procéder aux examens nécessaires à
l'établissement du diagnostic, tout en tenant compte des contraintes financières que cela peut entraîner:
la notion de consentement éclairé prend là toute sa dimension, c'est-à-dire que le propriétaire prend sa
décision après avoir entendu et compris les explications du vétérinaire. Il est donc indispensable qu'un
dialogue ouvert s'installe.

La contraception de la chienne

Quelles sont les méthodes de contraception chez la chienne?
Elles sont au nombre de 4 :
   Le repos surveillé à la maison;
   L’administration de comprimés (“pilule”);
   L’injection par un vétérinaire de progestatifs de synthèse;
   Enfin, la stérilisation chirurgicale.

La surveillance semble la méthode la plus simple …
Quand elle est possible, oui; cependant pour les chiennes vivant en pavillon, la visite des mâles est
toujours possible malgré les précautions qui peuvent être prises: une clôture de 2 m de haut n’arrête pas
un berger allemand!

Comment donner la “pilule” à une chienne?
Si l’on veut seulement décaler la période de chaleurs, la pilule se donne tous les jours pendant la
période choisie.


Si l’on désire supprimer un cycle, on utilisera les comprimés plusieurs jours de suite dès l’apparition des
premières pertes. Cette méthode n’est pas sans risque: l’administration d’hormones à ce moment du
cycle peut (dans 10% des cas environ) favoriser le développement de problèmes dans l’utérus (possibilité
de métrite, c’est à dire d’infection utérine).




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                45
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                          06/06/2008




Et pour les injections?
La méthode est plus sûre, car pratiquée en dehors des périodes de chaleurs; une injection tous les 5 ou 6
mois permet de maintenir le repos génital.

La stérilisation chirurgicale est une méthode plus lourde …
… Mais elle est faite une fois pour toutes et présente d’autres avantages: en dehors du fait que la
chienne n’aura plus de chaleurs (plus de pertes, plus d’attirance des mâles), l’ovariectomie (opération
qui consiste à enlever les ovaires) supprime toute la pathologie de l’appareil génital: pas de grossesse
nerveuse, pas de risque de métrite, et, si la chienne est opérée avant la puberté, c’est à dire entre 6 et 8
mois, pas de tumeurs mammaires. Ces pathologies sont courantes chez la chienne, aussi l’avantage pour
la santé est-il loin d’être négligeable.

Quelle méthode choisir?
Première question à se poser: fera-t-on reproduire la chienne? La chirurgie est dans ce cas une contre-
indication (qui peut être temporaire, car l’opération peut se pratiquer à tout âge).
Si la chienne doit un jour avoir une portée, d’abord laisser passer les premières chaleurs sans rien faire
pour ne pas compromettre la fertilité; on préfèrera ensuite les injections, plus sûres, à la pilule.


Si par contre la chienne n’est pas (ou plus) destinée à la reproduction, la chirurgie est la meilleure
solution. C’est un investissement pour l’avenir de l’animal, plus rentable financièrement que les
injections (3 ans d’injections = le prix d’une intervention!).


Un chien a sailli ma chienne, et la gestation n’est pas désirée. Que peut-on faire?


On pratique une interruption de gestation. Plusieurs protocoles sont possibles, précocement dans les
quelques jours qui suivent la saillie, ou plus tardivement, jusqu’au 45è jour de gestation.


Là encore, la chirurgie est possible si on ne veut plus faire reproduire la chienne: l’intervention est alors
programmée 3 semaines après la saillie; si la chienne est pleine, ce qui se voit pendant l’acte
chirurgical, on pratiquera une ovario-hystérectomie (retrait des ovaires et de l’utérus contenant les
petits), et si la chienne est vide (saillie non fécondante), on ne retirera que les ovaires (ovariectomie).

Les vaccinations du chien

Et d' abord, pourquoi vacciner nos animaux de compagnie ?
La question peut surprendre mais il y tant de propriétaires d' animaux qui ignorent la réponse que de
ce fait, ils en oublient ou ils négligent de faire pratiquer cet acte régulièrement, le jugeant inutile et par
ailleurs coûteux.


Pourtant il s' agit là d'une action médicale importante pour la vie de nos compagnons à quatre pattes.
C'est avant tout un acte de protection essentiel pour éviter que le chien contracte des maladies, parfois
transmissibles à l' Homme, et dont certaines peuvent être fatales.

- Quelles sont les vaccinations couramment pratiquées chez le chien?
Elles sont au nombre de 6 :


   La maladie de Carré : qui doit son nom au chercheur qui l' a identifiée en premier, est
    certainement la plus connue. Due à un virus, elle peut toucher TOUS les chiens, quel que soit leur
    âge… et pas seulement les jeunes comme le croient beaucoup de personnes !
    La contamination se fait essentiellement par inhalation et les principaux symptômes sont de la
    fièvre, de la toux, des yeux purulents, parfois de la diarrhée accompagnée de vomissements et enfin
    des troubles nerveux ( paralysie, convulsions, troubles de l' équilibre, … ). Le pronostic reste
    toujours réservé; la maladie évoluant vers des séquelles nerveuses ou respiratoires quand ce n’est
    pas la mort du chien.
   L'hépatite de Rubarth : (Hépatite contagieuse canine ) : Également due à un virus, elle touche
    plus particulièrement les jeunes. Parfois mortelle, elle se traduit essentiellement par un épisode de
    fièvre précédant des troubles digestifs (vomissements, diarrhée et perte d’appétit ) et oculaires ( «
    cornée bleue » ). Dans cette forme, la guérison intervient en quelques jours
   La gastro-entérite hémorragique ou parvovirose : Maladie très contagieuse, elle est provoquée
    par un virus et concerne plus particulièrement les chiots entre 6 et 12 semaines entraînant
    généralement la mort à cet âge. Comme son nom l' indique, elle se traduit par des vomissements qui
    font suite à une phase de prostration et d' anorexie et qui s' accompagnent de diarrhée d' aspect
    hémorragique. La déshydratation et les complications bactériennes qui suivent provoquent
    généralement la mort en 5 à 6 jours.
    La contamination se fait par contact direct avec un autre chien ou par l’intermédiaire des selles
    d'un animal contaminé.
   Les leptospiroses : Il s'agit là de maladies potentiellement contagieuses aux personnes. Chez le
    chien atteint, on va noter habituellement soit une gastro-entérite hémorragique plus ou moins aiguë
    avec abattement et fièvre évoluant vers des complications nerveuses, rénales, … et la mort; soit vers
    un ictère ( « jaunisse » ) avec là aussi vomissements, diarrhée … et mort en quelques jours. Une
    forme rénale de la maladie passant par une crise d’urémie puis la mort est également décrite.
    L'urine des animaux malades est une source de contamination primordiale de cette maladie; de
    même que l’eau de rivière et les objets souillés.
   La Toux de chenil : Malgré son nom, cette maladie ne concerne pas que les chiens vivant en
    collectivité. Elle est provoquée par l’association de différents microbes qui vont déclencher une toux
    forte, sèche et quinteuse plus ou moins grave selon l'âge et l’état de santé du chien. Elle peut
    également s’accompagner d’écoulements purulents au niveau des narines et d’une conjonctivite.
    L’évolution est généralement longue, la guérison n’intervenant qu’au bout de quelques semaines.
   La Rage : Maladie mortelle à 100 % dès que les symptômes apparaissent, la rage est transmissible
    à tous les carnivores notamment et surtout à l'Homme. La contamination se fait essentiellement
    par la salive, à l'occasion généralement d’une morsure. Après une période d'incubation qui peut
    durer 1 mois, le virus rabique va provoquer l’apparition de troubles nerveux que l'on



- Ces maladies sont-elles dangereuses pour l'homme?
Oui pour la rage: c'est pourquoi la vaccination anti-rabique est strictement réglementée.


Non pour l'hépatite de Rubarth, la parvovirose et la maladie de Carré: aucune transmission possible.




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                    47

Les leptospiroses sont des maladies communes au chien et à l'homme, mais la transmission se faisant
par l'urine du chien malade, la contagion est peu probable...

- Existe-t-il d'autres maladies contre lesquelles on peut protéger un chien, et dans
l'affirmative, pourquoi ne pas les inclure systématiquement dans le protocole de
vaccination?
Il est également possible de protéger contre la piroplasmose, la "toux de chenil", et contre le tétanos. En
dehors des raisons économiques (notamment pour le vaccin piroplasmose), il y a de bonnes raisons de ne
pas vacciner tous les chiens contre ces maladies:


        ❱   La piroplasmose est cantonnée à certaines régions géographiques et par contre
            pratiquement absente ailleurs (en particulier on en trouve très rarement près de la côte
            méditerranéenne entre Montpellier et Nice);
        ❱   La toux de chenil est une maladie des chiens vivant en collectivité plutôt fermée (chenils,
            meutes...), et peu rencontrée chez les chiens vivant isolés, du moins sous nos climats secs.
            Notons que certains vaccins associés incluent une valence "Adénovirus", qui est une des
            composantes de la toux de chenil mais ne confère pas une protection complète.
        ❱   Enfin, le tétanos est une maladie exceptionnelle chez le chien, qui semble incomparablement
            plus résistant à cette maladie que l'homme; c'est pourquoi on ne pratique pas en routine la
            vaccination anti-tétanique dans l'espèce canine.

- Les vaccinations sont-elles obligatoires?
Légalement, seule la vaccination anti-rabique (rage) est obligatoire, et seulement dans les cas suivants:
    ❱   Régions françaises infectées par la rage (départements 08, 54, 55, 57 et 67);
    ❱   Passage d'une frontière ou séjour en Corse et Outre-mer;
    ❱   Séjour en camping;
    ❱   Présentation en exposition canine
    ❱   Chiens visés par la loi du 30 avril 1999: Pittbull, Boerbull, Tosa, Staffordhire terrier et
        apparentés, Rottweiler et apparentés..


Attention, le certificat de primo-vaccination antirabique n'est valable qu'un mois après sa délivrance.
Si vous devez vous rendre dans une région concernée, pensez à la vaccination contre la rage un mois au
moins avant votre départ...


Les autres vaccinations ne sont pas obligatoires, mais les maladies contre lesquelles elles protègent sont
beaucoup plus fréquentes ! Ce sont les plus utiles pour protéger la santé de votre chien.

- Comment vaccine-t-on un chien?
La vaccination est possible dès l'âge de 7 semaines et se pratique en 2 ou 3 injections à un mois
d'intervalle. Pour maintenir la protection vaccinale, un rappel annuel est impératif (ne croyez pas que la
maladie de Carré ne touche que les jeunes chiens: la durée d'efficacité du vaccin ne dépasse pas 30 mois
et il n'est pas rare de voir des chiens âgés contracter une maladie de Carré).

- Doit on prendre des mesures particulières avant de vacciner un chien?
Pratiquer une vermifugation systématique des jeunes chiots (ceci peut se commencer à la première
injection), et ne vacciner que les animaux en bonne santé. Il est préférable de différer la vaccination des
chiennes en gestation jusqu'à la mise-bas.

Pourquoi vermifuger son chien ?

La protection de l’animal parasité
Si tous les parasites intestinaux du chien n’ont pas la même agressivité, certains sont particulièrement
pathogènes, comme les Ascaris: retard de croissance, carences en vitamines, diminution des défenses
immunitaires, diarrhées chroniques, etc... On sait qu’une majorité de chiens est infestée à la naissance
(transmission placentaire ou par le lait) : le parasitisme n’est donc pas limité aux chiens errants!

La protection de la famille
Les parasites intestinaux peuvent être responsables de zoonoses, c’est à dire qu’ils sont susceptibles de
se transmettre à l’espèce humaine.


Ainsi, les œufs d’Ascaris présents dans les selles des chiens (mais aussi des chats) peuvent être
accidentellement ingérés par des enfants (attention aux bacs à sable...) et provoquer des troubles liés au
syndrome larva migrans : des larves d’ascaris se développent dans le corps de l’enfant et se déplacent en
touchant différents organes : poumons (pneumonies), foie (douleurs abdominales), et même dans les
yeux (uvéites).


Certains ténias (échinocoques) sont la cause de troubles gravissimes, dus au développement de kystes
larvaires (kystes hydatiques) dans le foie, le cerveau.
Il est donc sage de vermifuger régulièrement l’animal pour se prémunir de ces maladies.

Calendrier de vermifugation
La vermifugation du chiot est essentielle : tout chiot doit être vermifugé dès l’âge de un mois, et tous les
mois jusqu’à l’âge de six mois, afin de détruire tous les stades larvaires qui peuvent persister dans
l’organisme jusqu’à cet âge.


Par la suite, la vermifugation sera adaptée au mode de vie de l’animal; en fonction des régions et des
éventuels contacts avec les autres chiens, il faut vermifuger deux à quatre fois par an. Une
vermifugation au printemps et à l’automne apparaît le minimum souhaitable pour tous les chiens.


La chienne gestante est également à vermifuger soigneusement; le risque de transmission de parasites
aux chiots sera ainsi limité : traiter au moment de la saillie, puis 10 jours plus tard et 10 jours après la
mise-bas.

Quels produits utiliser ?
Tous les vermifuges ne se valent pas : chaque produit a son spectre d’activité, certains sont à éviter sur
la chienne gestante, d’autres ont une meilleure activité larvicide (important chez le chiot).


D’autre part, les présentations sont multiples et adaptables à tous les cas de figure : comprimés, pâte en
seringue, liquides, et même “spot-on” (liquide à poser sur la peau) ... Les vermifuges modernes sont par
ailleurs dépourvus d’effets secondaires (vomissements, diarrhée) et ne nécessitent pas de précaution
particulière (pas de mise à la diète dans la plupart des cas).


Pour ne pas vous y perdre, le plus simple est de demander conseil à votre vétérinaire. Souvenez-vous
que la délivrance d’un médicament par votre vétérinaire ne passe pas obligatoirement par la
consultation : n’hésitez pas à lui demander conseil.

La toux de chenil
La toux de chenil est une affection multifactorielle, c'est à dire qui a plusieurs causes:
   Virus : notamment le Parainfluenza (valence Pi des vaccins canins)
   Bactéries : bordetella, pasteurella entre autres; ces bactéries sont extrêmement fréquentes (l'homme
    en héberge dans ses voies respiratoires), mais leur nombre devient plus important si les autres
    causes sont présentes, et à ce moment elles deviennent pathogènes
   Causes Physiques : froid, chaleur excessive, atmosphère irritante (cigarette!)
    C'est l'association des tous ces facteurs qui rend possible le développement des toux de chenil; c'est
    surtout une maladie d'effectifs (élevages, refuges, pensions pour chiens), se manifestant comme son
    nom l'indique par de la toux; comme l'irritation se limite habituellement aux premières voies
    respiratoires (gorge, trachée, bronches), la toux est habituellement forte (gros tuyaux!), quinteuse,
    et se termine par un effort de vomissement.


Le traitement repose sur l'antibiothérapie adaptée, mais les antibiotiques n'ont aucune action sur les
virus, ce qui explique que certains cas peuvent traîner; il faut donc que le système immunitaire de
l'animal trouve la clé pour se débarrasser des virus, ce qui peut être long (jusqu'à trois semaines!). Le
pronostic des toux de chenil est bon si les conditions de détention de l'animal sont bonnes (pas de froid,
pas d'humidité, atmosphère saine).


La vaccination est possible, mais une simple injection anti-parainfluenza ne protège pas contre toutes
les causes: un bon vaccin "toux de chenil" devrait comprendre les valences bordetella et pasteurella (cela
existe, mais c'est à réserver aux chiens à risque).

Eppilet : Attention danger
Il est tout petit; tellement fréquent dès que les beaux jours arrivent qu'on en oublie sa présence et
pourtant c'est une source de bien des désagréments. Voici venu le temps, dans le Sud de la France des
épillets, ces petits brins d’herbe sèches qui sont en fait la partie terminale des graminées. Frêle




©MORIN S.A. France | www.morinfrance.com                                                                    50
FICHE PRATIQUE – LE CHIEN                                                                          06/06/2008



structure végétale, l' « espigaou » de Marseille ou l' « espangassat » de Béziers est constituée d’une fine
tige piquante se poursuivant généralement en forme de plumet pointu se comportant une fois implanté
comme un hameçon. ( cf photo ).

Pourquoi faut il être vigilant à propos de ces fameux épillets ?
Et bien, tout simplement parce qu'ils peuvent s'introduire :
        ❱   Dans les oreilles : c'est la localisation la plus fréquente. Très vite alors, votre chien va gémir
            en secouant ou penchant la tête et en cherchant à se gratter l’oreille concernée. Le risque à
            ce moment là est la perforation possible du tympan ou l'évolution vers une otite suppurée.
            Tout cela concerne plus spécialement les chiens à oreilles tombantes et poilues (caniches,
            …).
        ❱   Dans une narine : sont plutôt concernés les chiens de chasse et les chiens « renifleurs ». Le
            chien va alors se mettre à éternuer de manière répétée, du moins au début; ces
            éternuements étant souvent teintés de sang. Là aussi, le risque infectieux des sinus est
            important si l' on ne procède pas à son retrait rapidement. De même dans des cas plus rares
            il est vrai, cela peut aboutir avec le temps, à une atteinte sévère des voies respiratoires
            profondes.
        ❱   Dans l’œil, ou plus exactement sous la paupière . A chaque battement de paupière, l’épillet
            va frotter contre la cornée, entraînant une forte douleur oculaire, un larmoiement purulent
            et provoquant très vite une ulcération parfois dramatique de cette cornée. Les chats
            semblent très concernés par cette localisation.
        ❱   Dans les espaces inter digités de la patte du chien: c'est là un point de fixation très fréquent
            de l’épillet. Par les mouvements de la marche, il va pouvoir facilement perforer la peau et
            progresser ensuite dans les différents tissus avec pour conséquence une boiterie quasi
            systématique de l' animal, avec léchage important du bout de la patte qui est alors
            généralement gonflé.


D’autres localisations sont également possibles, bien que moins fréquentes: le fourreau chez le mâle ou
la vulve chez la femelle, les glandes anales ( autour de l' anus ), les différents plis de peau du corps de l'
animal,…


Aussi, lors de la saison estivale, si votre chien se secoue fébrilement la tête, notamment après une
promenade en campagne, ou s’il se met à éternuer des gouttelettes de sang en rentrant de ballade, s’il
se frotte un œil ou s'il n'arrête pas de se lécher le bout de la patte, pensez tout de suite un éventuel
épillet implanté.


Il faudra alors très rapidement consulter votre vétérinaire, car le temps qui passe ne fera qu'aggraver
les choses et il y a peu de chances qu’un épillet implanté s'élimine, du moins sans séquelle pour
l’animal.


Mais là aussi, la prévention est importante. Il n’existe pas de vaccin contre les épillets; mais un bon
toilettage peut s'avérer suffisant. Aussi, si vous possédez un chien à poil long et/ou frisé (Caniche,
Bichon, mais aussi Briard, Colley, …) n'hésitez pas à demander à votre toiletteur une coupe spéciale «
anti-épillet » qui dégagera bien l'entrée du conduit auditif notamment (avec une bonne épilation), ainsi
que le bout des pattes qui doit être bien rasé pour éviter qu' un épillet s'y accroche.

Une autre astuce pour les oreilles peut être de mettre un peu de vaseline autour de l’entrée des conduits
auditifs pour qu'un éventuel épillet s'y colle plutôt que de s' enfoncer trop rapidement vers le tympan.
Tout cela ne dispense pas de systématiquement inspecter le pelage de votre animal après une
promenade en campagne ou dans le terrain vague tout proche de chez vous.

Introduction
Around the globe, Dogs are among the most popular family pets. Their Sense of loyalty,
compassion and their ability to be trained is what they are known for among popular pets.
Dogs can be taught countless tricks and behaviors ranging from very basic ones like sitting,
going outside to do their business to very complex tricks like scent recognition and
acrobatics.

      Because every dog is different, training is never a sure experience; nonetheless, any
canine may be trained provided you have the will and drive. I'll go over the most basic
training strategies that can be applied on most dogs in this book. Positive reinforcement
training is being emphasized since it is successful and considerably safer than alternative
methods that have been employed in the past. We won't dive into dramatic tricks or
acrobatics because of the book's small length; nevertheless, it's always a good idea to start
with a solid foundation, which is obedience training. Dog obedience training is a broad phrase
that encompasses a wide range of dog training methods. Whatever training method you use,
it should help you and your dog develop a healthy and suitable connection.

      Training opens up a clear line of communication between you and your dog. This
includes you knowing what to expect of your dog in all circumstances, and your dog
understanding and respecting what is expected of him/her. Dog Training for Obedience lays
down a set of rules or boundaries which educates your dog to become a responsible member
of society. This includes basic manners, how to behave in any situation, how to relate to
other dogs, animals and people. Lastly it establishes the groundwork which assists in
preventing the development of unacceptable problem behavior such as jumping up, barking,
chewing, digging etc.
Key Benefits of Obedience Training
Dog training for obedience is the very best thing you can do for the relationship you enjoy
with your dog. Basic obedience training makes life simple to your dog and eliminates
confusion. Your dog will know his place in the world and understand right from wrong. Dogs
really appreciate this black and white view of the world.

         Training done right is fun and rewarding for both you and your dog. You will have a
happy, relaxed and confident dog who you can take anywhere and will be a pleasure to be
around. Greater freedom can also be extended to your dog, as he will be more trustworthy
when obedience trained.

         An obedience trained puppy or dog is a much safer dog. If your dog dashes out the
front door you will still have voice control over him. You will be able to call on one of your
obedience training commands like "come" "down" or "sit". This is very reassuring for any dog
lover.

         You gain trust and mutual respect with your dog. He understands what is expected of
him and knows that you will always be fair and consistent with this. When your dog is trained
in obedience he will be fine around friends and kids under supervision.

         Training also meets some of the most important rudimentary needs your dog has like
exercise, mental stimulation, spending time with you and providing activities to keep your
canine friend happy. Dog obedience training drastically minimizes the chances of your dog
and you getting into a power conflict. You'll be his powerful and always fair leader, whom he'll
respect and look to for guidance. Obedience training is a step-by-step procedure that you can
progress through over time. It lays the groundwork for your dog to learn new skills and
commands. Your dog will acquire confidence as you progress through this process.

It’s A Lack of Training That’s Dangerous!
Untrained dogs are the leading cause of puppies and dogs ending up in animal shelters all
around the world, which is a terrible truth. This isn't good for anyone, let alone the dogs.
Your dog will never be able to be truly close to you and your family. This means that your dog
will spend most of his time alone in the yard, rather than participating in family activities.
This can cause plenty of behavioral issues and be a nuisance to both you and your neighbors.
When it comes to people, other animals, and the roads, your dog can be dangerous.

Untrained dogs are prone to questioning your leadership or authority. Obedience-trained dogs
will strive to put you to the test in the same way. However, after you've mastered obedience
training, you'll be equipped to handle it. Your dog will be yelled at and pushed further away
from you and your family on a regular basis (but ineffectively).




Pre-Training Guidelines
By choosing from the options below, you may learn how to train for certain obedience
instructions. Here are some general dog obedience training ideas to remember:

   •   When your dog performs what you ask, praise and reward him; when he doesn't do
       what he's been taught, reprimand him appropriately. The trick is to discover your
       dog's ideal balancing.
   •    Don't expect your dog to immediately grasp these concepts. The command and action
       must be repeated several times. Keep your faith in what you're doing.
   •    Maintain consistency and make it as easy as possible for your dog. Give him an easy
       choice to make, and make it obvious to him which options are acceptable and which
       ones are not, provide immediate response.
   •    Be realistic and fair when correcting or punishing your dog for not doing something he
       hasn't been properly taught to do.
   •   Keep your training sessions brief, focused, and enjoyable for both you and your dog.
       Many dog training schools fail in this area.
   •    Start slowly and learn one simple command before progressing and building on it.
       Throughout the training process, keep your dog cognitively challenged and stimulated.
   •    Put the obedience commands to the test in various situations, locations, and with
       various distractions.
   •   Include obedience training in your everyday routine; for example, your dog might "sit"
       before you give him his supper or "down stay" while you go retrieve the mail.
   •   If you don't catch your dog doing something wrong, never try to reprimand him;
       timing your correction is crucial.
   •   Figure out what encourages your dog, this can come in handy during training sessions.

Puppy Training: Leash Walking
While the first three commands may be taught at any age, there are several things that
should be taught as soon as possible so that your puppy develops these habits. One of the
first lessons you should give your puppy is how to behave on a leash. It's a critical skill to
perfect for the future of both you and your dog. A puppy that has been trained to walk on a
leash is more safe and easier to manage.

      If you follow the methods given below, you should be able to train your puppy to walk
on a leash in a few of weeks. Some puppies will learn it in a few days, while others may take
much longer. Never give up, don’t expect your dog to know it all! Your objective is to clearly
communicate to your dog what is and is not appropriate leash conduct.


The Three-Step Guide:

Step 1: Collar Familiarity
As soon as your puppy arrives at his new home, you may take this initial step. It entails
familiarizing and acclimating your young dog to wearing a collar. This activity is best
accomplished with a basic light-weight leather collar. Place it on your dog when you are
feeding him or playing with him to create a distraction from the collar. He'll probably roll
about in an attempt to dislodge it, or scratch it off as best he can. It's critical that you don't
take it away from him while he's doing this. Before you remove it, wait until he has settled
down and forgotten about it.

Step 2: Leash Familiarity
After your dog is acquainted with his new collar, it's time to introduce the leash. It's the same
thing here; all you have to do is get him comfortable to the leash and show that it's nothing
to be scared of. Any light-weight, thin leash will suffice at this stage. Once your dog has been
properly leash trained, you may purchase him a lovely leather leash if you like. Connect the
leash to his collar and allow him to explore and drag it around the house (always under your
supervision). After a while, he'll forget about it.
Step 3: In-Depth Leash Training
It's time to take up the other end of the leash now that your dog is comfortable with his collar
and with the leash. Make the initial leash training sessions brief, sharp, and enjoyable. You'll
probably discover that your puppy loves to follow you around everywhere at this period, so
take advantage of it. To begin, simply go around the home with your puppy jogging beside
you while holding the leash. Give him lots of praise, petting, and even treats while he walks
along on a loose leash.

      Stop instantly if he pulls on the leash. Instead of yanking him back over to you with
the leash, simply call him over and reward him when he arrives. When your puppy pulls on
the leash, never continue walking, this merely rewards his behavior and encourages the
habit. Your puppy must learn that pulling on the leash will get him nowhere. If he wants to
keep walking, he must do so beside you on a loose leash. If your dog sits down while you're
walking, the same rule applies. Call him over and praise him when he arrives, rather than
yanking him forward. Then set off on a stroll again, this time with your dog by your side.

      This method of teaching a puppy to walk on a leash is best for very young puppies
since it does not need you or your dog to pull. As a consequence, you and your dog will have
a nice loose leash hanging down between. To do this, simply follow the steps above, then be
patient and persistent.




        [DISCOVER A GREAT PRODUCT HELPING MILLIONS OF DOGS AROUND THE GLOBE]
The “Sit” Command
       Starting your obedience training with your dog by teaching him to sit on command is a
wonderful place to start. It's a simple command that your puppy or dog will rapidly learn. This
will boost your dog's confidence while also laying the groundwork for more advanced
commands and skills.

       Another advantage of training your dog to sit is that it provides you with an additional
behavior to request. If your dog jumps up all over guests to your house or dashes out the
front door every time it opens, you may get control of him by using your "sit" command.

       You may begin teaching this obedience command as soon as your new puppy arrives
home, or at any time thereafter. Before you start teaching your dog to sit (or any other
obedience order), make sure he's confident and at ease around you - he lets you handle him,
pays attention to you, and so on.

General Rules to Remember When Training Your Dog To Sit
   •   Keep your training sessions short, ten minutes is plenty to begin with.
   •   Any time is a good time to practice really, you don't have to structure all your lessons.
       Incorporate the training into your daily routine. Get your dog to sit before you feed
       him or make him sit before you throw his ball at the park. When applied in this
       manner obedience training will be fun in your dog's mind, and rewarding.
   •   Make it perfectly clear to your dog what you what you want him to do.
   •   Make training your dog to sit fun, don't make it feel like a chore, for you or your dog.
   •   Training sessions should be full of consistent repetition, praise and positive
       reinforcement.
   •   Don't expect your dog to immediately learn this, or any other obedience command and
       then never forget it. It's up to you to reinforce the meaning of your command through
       repetition and consistency throughout your dog's life.
   •    Eliminate food rewards gradually throughout the learning period of a new command.
       Giving your dog a food treat or reward now and again isn't going to affect him, even if
       he obeys your commands without it.
   •   Make it simple for your dog to succeed while training him to sit for the first time. Begin
       your training sessions in an atmosphere that is comfortable to your dog and free of
       extraneous distractions. In this setting, master the command, then gradually increase
       the difficulty for your dog. Add more variables and give your dog a challenge, such as
       bringing the training session to the park or extending the sit time.
The Three-Step Guide:

Step 1: Puppy Connection
This initial method of training is ideal for young puppies. Say "sit" in a clear and strong tone
to your dog when you observe him ready to sit or in the process of sitting. Give your dog a
pat on the head and a scratch behind the ear as soon as his rear end touches the floor. You're
creating an association in your dog's head between your vocal "sit" command and the act of
him sitting. This link is made by the majority of puppies reasonably soon. You'll soon be able
to say "sit" whenever you want, and your puppy will comprehend what you're asking of him.
Remember to treat and praise your dog as soon as his backside touches the ground. Your
puppy will be ecstatic, he'll think to himself, "All I have to do is sit down and I receive
attention, treats, and praise!"

Step 2: “Off Leash” Training
This kind of training works every time for older puppies and dogs. Grab a tiny delicious treat
in your palm and place it in front of your dog. Guide the treat up above his head from his
nose level, the treat should always be a few inches away from your dog. Your curious dog's
nose will follow the treat up and his back end will touch the ground at the same moment.
Give him the treat as soon as he sits down and shower him with praise. You're holding your
hand too far back above his head or too far away from his nose if your dog backs away or
leaps up at the treat. After your dog understands this phase, you may introduce the vocal
portion of the command. Say "sit" just before you start moving your hand (the one holding
the treat). Without even moving your hand, your dog will quickly respond to your vocal "sit"
command. Remember to practice/reinforce this directive at any moment and in any scenario
throughout the day.

Step 3: “On Leash” Training
This strategy will work if your dog doesn't respond to the methods mentioned above, or if you
prefer to teach using a collar and leash. Stand next to your dog, facing the same direction.
Straighten the leash and place it precisely over the collar. Simultaneously, push down softly
on your dog's back (near his hips) and say "sit." Reward and praise your dog as soon as he is
in the sitting posture. You won't need to press down on your dog's back or even hold the
leash up in no time. He'll realize that when you say "sit," you're asking him to put his
backside on the ground. And he'll be delighted to do it for you since he knows it will bring him
praise and attention.
The “Down” Command
        The next order to teach in your dog obedience training session is the down command.
When you and your dog have learned the sit command, you should teach it. The down
command is an important part of your dog's overall obedience training. It positions you as the
leader in your relationship with your dog and lays the groundwork for many more advanced
commands/skills. The reason for this is because laying down is a submissive and vulnerable
position for your dog, especially when you are standing tall over your dog.

        The down command is a highly useful tool that you will find yourself using in a variety
of scenarios. When you need to walk into a store or when there are little children present,
putting your dog down in the lying down posture is ideal. It may take some practice to get to
this level, but the work is well worth it.

General Rules for Learning The Down Command
When teaching your dog the down command, begin by making it simple for him, then
gradually increase the difficulty level.

    •   Move your training sessions to a public place.
    •   Increase the time you keep your dog in the down position.

   • When your dog is lying down, bounce a ball around him or scatter some food around
   him. The goal is that in your dog's head, your "down" command will be so strong that
   none of the other distractions will matter. When you release him from the down order, he
   can only rise up to chase the ball or eat the rewards.

    •   With the down command, you want your dog to immediately go into a lying posture,
        with his tummy touching the ground and his front legs extended out in front.
    •   Let's get started in a comfortable setting for your dog with no distractions!




         [DISCOVER A GREAT PRODUCT HELPING MILLIONS OF DOGS AROUND THE GLOBE]
The Two-Step Guide

Step 1: Off-Leash Training
   • While your dog is lying down, bounce a ball around him or sprinkle some food around
him. The goal is for your "down" command to be so strong in your dog's mind that it will
overpower all other distractions. When you free him from the down order, he can only go up
to chase the ball or enjoy the prizes.

   you want your dog to lie down with his belly on the ground and his front legs extended out
in front when you say "down."

   Let's get this party started for your dog in a distraction-free atmosphere!

   After a lot of repetition and praise, your dog will just need your vocal command and not
the treat in your hand. You'll be ready to initiate the command not just from a sitting
position, but also from a standing position and in whatever situation you and your dog find
themselves in over time.

   • Add some extra factors to make the down command more challenging after your dog is
responding well to your voice order. Increase the duration of the command as you go about
your daily activities, especially if you're around other people or dogs.

Step 2: On-Leash Training
Put your dog's favorite collar and leash on him, while teaching the down command, I like to
use a nice leather buckle collar.

   •   Position your dog in a sitting position and stand or kneel next to him.


   •   Essentially, you're attempting to persuade or direct your dog into a down posture. The
       method you use will be determined by your dog's size and level of cooperation.




   •   Always say your "down" command first, then assist your dog down into the laying
       posture as quickly as possible. Grab the leash and gently pull your dog's head down,
       while simultaneously guiding him down by placing your palm between his shoulder
       blades. Find the approach that works best for you by lifting up your dog's front legs
       and extending them out in front of him. All the way down, praise and encourage your
       dog. Then, as soon as he's down, let him know that you're pleased with him and that
       he's done a wonderful job.
•    Your dog will only listen to your spoken commands after a lot of repetition. Then test
    the command in other settings with your dog, such as while he is standing. Add some
    distractions and lengthen the time he must stay in the down posture to make the
    command more difficult.




•   Whichever method you choose to teach your dog the down command be consistent
    and keep at it. When you are happy with your dog getting into the down position you
    will probably want to add a release command to it. This means that when you issue
    your down command, your dog goes straight down and is not permitted to get up until
    you issue another command. You can use "away" or "off you go" for this purpose.




    [DISCOVER A GREAT PRODUCT HELPING MILLIONS OF DOGS AROUND THE GLOBE]
The “Come” Command
      The order "Come" or "Come Here!" is one of the most significant obedience commands
you'll ever teach your puppy or adult dog. You will undoubtedly rely on it to direct your dog
away from significant danger at some point.

      Aside from being necessary for safety, when your dog has mastered the dog training
"come" command, he or she may be given more freedom in a lot of situations. When you're
at the beach or on a hike, your dog can wander out on his own and explore, but he'll always
be alert and ready to answer to your come order. This provides you with a sense of security.

      When teaching your dog the come command (also known as recall), your ultimate aim
is to have your dog respond immediately to your order every time, regardless of what else is
going on in the vicinity.

      But let's not kid ourselves, eliciting this kind of response isn't always easy. It takes a
lot of effort to train a dog to come when called, and the fact is that some dogs struggle to get
it properly. The come command really works against the natural inclinations of some breeds
and dogs that like chasing or who have a high scent drive.

      Don't let this discourage you, the strategies mentioned below will help you achieve.
Basically, you may teach the fast come command to your new puppy (the sooner the better)
or older dog as soon as you acquire him or her, and you'll be reinforcing it every time you're
with him or her throughout his or her life.




        [DISCOVER A GREAT PRODUCT HELPING MILLIONS OF DOGS AROUND THE GLOBE]
Why Doesn't Your Dog Come When Called?
These are the most typical reasons why our wonderful pets appear to ignore us and do not
respond when we call to them.

   •   Your dog doesn't comprehend the "come" command because he doesn't grasp what
       you're asking him to do.
   •   In the past, your dog may have gotten away with disobeying your come command and
       not been held accountable for his actions (or lack thereof!).
   •   Your dog may decide that following a squirrel's scent trail or romping about with other
       dogs in the park is more appealing than returning to you.
   •   Perhaps your dog has previously obeyed your instruction but was unintentionally
       penalized for it. This might indicate that you called him over and immediately
       locked him in a crate, or that you called him over and quickly threw him into a soapy
       bath (which he despises!).

General Guidelines for the “Come” Command
   •   Never reprimand your dog when he returns to you. Even if your dog appears to take a
       long time to reply to you and you're fuming from irritation, it's critical that you don't
       become upset with your dog. Your dog will associate your anger with the last action he
       or she did, which was coming to you.
   •   Your objective is to make coming to you a more appealing option for your dog than
       any other alternative activity.
   •   Never allow your dog off the leash in public until he or she has mastered the come
       command. Your dog must earn this privilege - see the dog training come command
       steps below.
   •   Your come command should be something your dog enjoys hearing and associates
       with a good feeling. You do this by making each trip to you delightful, make it
       worthwhile for him to come to you. Use the command for more than just calling your
       dog over to snap the leash back on after an off-leash run or to keep him away from
       fun.
   •    Make the come command a part of your everyday routine. It may be used to summon
       your dog for supper or to just give him a scratch behind the ear or a nice treat at any
       moment.
   •    If your dog doesn't respond when you teach him the come command off leash, don't
       chase him down, instead, try waiting for him. If you have to go get him, don't
       reprimand him when you get him, instead, go home or resume your training session,
       this time on leash.
   •   Never call your dog in situations you know your dog won't come to you. You don't
       want your dog to believe it's okay to ignore your "come" order sometimes. It must be
       followed at all times, and your dog must never be allowed to ignore it.
   •   As with all obedience commands, begin with the basics and work your way up. Master
       one step at a time. Along the way, set some challenges for your dog, but don't rush.
       Throughout the entire procedure, your dog will acquire confidence.

You can use one or all of the stages indicated below, depending on what level you and your
dog are in your obedience training. I've discovered that if you use these training strategies
with repetition, reinforcement, and patience, you and your dog will achieve great results.


The Comprehensive Six-Step Guide:
   Step: 1. Young puppies enjoy following you around and often bound up to you with joy -
       take advantage of this. All you need to do at this point is show your puppy that you are
       delighted to see him whenever he comes to you. Every time, make it a pleasurable and
       rewarding experience.


   Step: 2. Next, introduce the verbal "come" order so that your dog associates it with the
       act of approaching you. Start indoors with no distractions, squat or kneel, and say
       "Macy come" (Macy is my Shih Tzu puppy) in a pleasant and inviting manner. If
       required, wave a tasty treat around to entice your dog over. When your puppy (or
       older dog) approaches you, praise and reward him right away for his efforts. To
       strengthen the connection, repeat this activity several times throughout the day.


   Step: 3. If you have someone else there to help, you can now introduce the "back and
       forth" game. Position yourself at one side of the room and your helper on the other
       side. Call your dog over with the command "Macy come" (just once, but you can
       encourage him), then praise him when he arrives, and then have your assistant call
       him over and reward him when he arrives. This game is a lot of fun for your dog, plus
       it teaches him to obey commands like "come" from people other than you. By walking
       into a separate room from your partner, calling your dog, and letting him locate you,
       you may turn this activity into a game of hide and seek. When he does hunt you down,
       make it worth his while, most dogs like this game.
Step: 4. Now that you're sure your dog understands and responds to your "come"
   command, you may practice it in a variety of settings. Head outdoors with your dog on
   a leash (the same one you use for walks). When your dog approaches you, call him
   with the same "come" command and move backwards, giving him a treat and a good
   scratch behind the ear. Practice this at several points during your usual walk, and
   remember to constantly compliment your dog on his or her accomplishments!




Step: 5. The following step is identical to step 4, only this time you'll use a long line
   instead. This is a lightweight rope that may be found in pet stores, hardware stores,
   and camping stores. Put the long line on in a familiar environment (such as your yard),
   then when you're ready, go on to public places (such as the park). The long line will
   trail behind your dog (she'll forget it's there after a while), giving him the impression
   that he has total freedom, but you can catch him at any time. Continue to say "come"
   to your dog and praise him when he responds, then send him on his way again. Please
   keep in mind that the trailing long line is not intended to "reel your dog in," but rather
   to prevent your dog from running away from you. With the trailing leash fastened on,
   any dog will find it difficult to outrun you, presumably, you won't need to chase your
   dog anyhow.


Step: 6. After that, you may play a fun game with your dog. Again, start in a secure,
   limited location devoid of distractions, and work your way up from there. For this task,
   you'll need your assistant once again. Stand around 50 feet away from your helper,
   with your dog loose on the street (you can have a tab leash on if you choose). Then
   toss a ball so that it falls near your assistant. Say "Macy come!" as soon as the ball
   leaves your hand, by doing so, you are providing your dog an option. He can either
   come to you when you ask (for which you would reward him) or he can leave after the
   ball. Your assistant reaches down and scoops up the ball before he comes if he decides
   it is a better option. Your assistant simply holds the ball and ignores your dog. Give
   your dog a pat when he decides it's time to return to you, but don't make a fuss. It's a
   good idea to change things up a little and throw the ball without saying "come" at
   times, simply letting your dog get the ball.




   If your dog doesn't seem to be "getting it" at any point during these stages, back up a
   step and start over.
The “Stay” Command
When you and your dog have learned the sit and down commands, the next obvious step is
to teach your dog how to stay. When you think about it, your sit and down commands aren't
very useful if your dog simply gets into those positions and then jumps right back up. That's
why, despite the fact that some dog trainers feel it's an unneeded supplementary command, I
like to include the stay command. Their belief is that if they ask their dog to sit or lie down,
the dog should stay in that posture until ordered differently. Please continue reading if you
want to utilize the stay command.

      Training a dog to stay can be difficult at first. It goes against your dog's natural
instincts and what he or she is used to (following you around or being close to their pack).
With this in mind, keep the stay command basic at first and gradually increase your dog's
success.

      Once you've taught your dog to stay in any scenario, you'll find it useful in a variety of
situations. It's a great behavior to request when visitors come to your home, if you need to
duck inside a shop or if you have a dog who likes to bolt out the front door.

      It's best to teach your dog to stay while he or she is calm and not overly excited, which
is usually after a walk. Your initial training session should take place in an area that is familiar
to your dog, devoid of distractions, and should only last a few minutes.




      [DISCOVER A GREAT PRODUCT HELPING MILLIONS OF DOGS AROUND THE GLOBE]
The Three-Step Guide:
Step 1: Position Training

Place your dog in the position you want him to stay in (using your sit, down, or stand
commands) and stand in front of him. If your dog is still in the posture you requested after 1
or 2 seconds, praise him and give him a treat. You are rewarding the desired behavior, which
is a stay, even if it is only for 1 second at first. The action is done (this is your signal for your
dog to release from his stay) as soon as you deliver your praise and treat, therefore it's
acceptable if your dog moves off. Then you start over from the beginning, perhaps holding
your praise and treat off for 3 or 4 seconds this time. Take it slowly, and if your dog breaks
out of the stay before you've given him the release command, simply say "No," don't give
him the treat, and repeat the procedure.

Step 2: Verbalize
Add a verbal order and a hand signal to step 1 as the following step. It goes like this: stand in
front of your dog once again and place him in the position you want him to stay in. Say "stay"
and extend your hand out in front of you, palm facing out towards your dog's nose, as soon
as he is in the proper posture (like a stop sign motion). After a few while of waiting, praise
and treat your dog for staying in this posture (sit-stay or down-stay etc.). You may now
repeat the process, increasing the duration between your "stay" order and your praise and
reward, as you did in step 1. What you're doing is instilling in your dog a mental link between
your vocal "stay" order and the act of staying in one place.

Step 3: Distraction Training
You've now figured out how to use the stay command in its most basic form. Now it's time to
add some more variables and build on top of that. The three D's - Duration, Distance, and
Distractions - are how many trainers refer to this proofing step. You've been working in a
comfortable environment, devoid of distractions, and standing right in front of your dog up
until now (steps 1 and 2). Let's mix it up a bit by introducing one new variable at a time.
Begin by issuing your "stay" command with your hand signal, then take a step backwards,
stop, and then step up to your dog. Praise your dog and offer him a tasty treat if he has
remained in his sit-stay or down-stay. Repeat the practice, progressively increasing the
number of steps you take back while remembering to always return to your dog before
rewarding him. Keep in mind that you're rewarding him for staying (the stay), and if he gets
up to leave, he shouldn't get a reward or treat. Moving your training session to a different
place, maybe somewhere with a few distractions such as other people or animals, is the next
obstacle you can add to the stay command. Remember to go gradually and just introduce one
new variable at a time.
Another helpful suggestion is to practice your stays whenever you get the opportunity.
throughout the day. For example, make your dog "stay" when you go out to collect the mail
or "stay" when you are preparing his dinner.

Hide and seek is a fun game to play with your dog to reinforce the "stay" command. This
game is a lot of fun, and all you have to do is put your dog in a down-stay and run away.
Sing out your release command when you're ready, and your dog will go on the hunt for you.

Note: Do not keep your dog in a sit-stay for more than 2 or 3 minutes when teaching him to
stay. Use the down-stay whenever you need your dog to stay for extended periods of time.

The “Heel” Command
To begin, I should point out that teaching a dog to heel is not the same as teaching a dog to
walk on a loose leash. Getting and keeping your dog's attention is crucial when training him
to heel. The heel can be used for short lengths of time (for example, when other dogs or
children are present), but it is not appropriate for lengthy daily walks.

Dog Training - The Heel
When your dog is in the heeling position, he or she is basically pinned to your left leg (but not
touching it) and must stay there until you release him or her. Heeling is a tough skill for your
dog to grasp, and it must be taught slowly and gradually. With my dogs, I find that short,
sharp, and intense training sessions work best. This is due to the fact that teaching your dog
to heel takes a great deal of focus and repetition. Don't expect too much too fast, start small,
give your dog a chance to succeed, and don't rush things.


The Comprehensive Eight-Step Guide:
Let's try our hand at making a sturdy and dependable heel. These stages can be completed
either off-leash (if feasible) or on-leash. The leash is just there for safety. It's not for
dragging your dog around or holding him in place. Rather than forcing your dog to be at your
side, the goal is to teach him to want to be there. This is how I train my dogs to heel. Start in
a setting that is comfortable to your dog and devoid of distractions, just like you would with
any other obedience command.

   Step: 1. Stand side by side with your dog next to your left leg, both of you looking the
       same direction.
   Step: 2. In your left hand, hold one of your dog's favorite treats, at your waist, not right
       in front of his nose. To get your dog's attention and make eye contact, say "Harry"
       (your dog's name). Take two steps forward and then come to a complete halt. If your
       dog moves with you while maintaining the heel posture, give him a reward and praise
       him warmly.
   Step: 3. Repeat the heeling technique as soon as your dog consumes his reward from
       step 2. Say "Harry," then take two steps forward while encouraging your dog ("come
       on," or "that's a good boy"), then come to a halt, praise, and reward. Give the treat
       only while your dog is still in the heel posture.


   Step: 4. Your dog will be very interested and attentive at this point. It's crucial to
       remember that you're rewarding his good behavior rather than luring or bribing him
       with the treat.
   Step: 5. Hold wait on your praise and reward if your dog lags behind or forges ahead of
       you. Simply say "“No" and begin the process all over again.


   Step: 6. Continue to work on your heel training, and when 2 steps forward become easy
       for your dog, progress to 4 steps, 6 steps, and so on... Continue to encourage, praise,
       and reward your dog with delectable treats.




   Step: 7. It's time to progress and add additional variables after your dog can
       successfully heel for 10 or more steps. Introduce the parts below one by one, making it
       as simple as possible for your dog to succeed. Continue to infuse your enthusiasm,
       encouragement, praise, and treats into the mix.


   •   Walk slowly, speed up, stop, speed up etc...
   •   Take your training session to a new location.
   •   Add some left and right turns and then some obstacles.
   •   Practice your heeling around other people and animals.
   •   Increase the duration of the heel.
   •   Roll a ball in front of you, what does your dog do?

That's the heel-training method I use and have had wonderful success with. Always
remember to have fun when training your puppies, and don't expect too much from them
right away, it will take some time.
The “Go To” Commands
The command "Go to Your Spot" is a wonderful one to teach your dog.

The command "Go to your Bed" is one of the most helpful and often utilized of all the dog
obedience commands in my opinion. It's fantastic for both practical and safety reasons, and I
use it in a variety of scenarios on a daily basis, including:

       • When guests come to my house. I use the "Go To Your Bed" command to control my
       dogs' behavior when they become overly excited and jump all over guests.
       • If your dog is barking excessively, you may use this obedience command to get your
       dog to do a different activity.
       • When my family and I sit down to eat, I direct my dogs to their designated area to
       allow us a bit of space.

One thing to always keep in mind when applying the Go to Your Spot command is that you
don't want it to feel like a punishment to your dog. In other words, don't always use it when
your dog is in trouble, try to make it a positive, fun place for your dog to retreat to.

      Follow the steps below to build the “Go To Your Spot” command slowly. Start out so it's
easy for your dog to understand, then gradually make it harder by adding other variables
(duration, distance and distractions).


The Nine-Step Guide:
             Step: 1.       Choose your designated spot (make sure it's a nice and comfortable
                 place), attach a label to it ("Go To Your Bed" "Go To Your Mat" etc.) and stick
                 with it.
             Step: 2.       Stand around 1-2 meters away from the designated place with your
                 dog. "Go to your bed," you say, pointing to the location. Throw one of your
                 dog's favorite treats onto the bed at the same time. Your dog will
                 undoubtedly hurry over to the bed to get his paws on the treat. As soon as
                 he/she takes the it, ensure to praise him.
             Step: 3.       To encourage the behavior, repeat step 2 several times. This also
                 creates a mental association in your dog's head between you saying "Go To
                 Your Bed" and pointing to his bed. It's essential to note that the reward is
                 now functioning as a bait to draw your dog over to the bed. however, this will
                 change in the future.
             Step: 4.       Increase the space between you and your dog and the bed by a few
                 inches at a time. Continue practicing "Go To Your Bed," pointing, throwing
                 the treat, and then praising.
             Step: 5.       It's time to switch the treat's role from that of a bait to that of a
                reward for the desired conduct. It works like this: say "Go To Your Bed" while
                pointing to the bed, but don't throw the treat this time. Your dog will most
                likely comprehend that you want him to go to his spot based on your vocal
                command and pointing. Then give him the treat (rewarding the action) and
                lavish him with praise if he obeys your command by going to his bed. If your
                dog still doesn't understand, go back a step and use the reward as a bait.


             Step: 6.       Repeat step 5 several times more. You can practice at any moment
                during the day, there is no need to schedule a specific training session. Also,
                switch up where you tell your dog to "Go To Your Bed." Say it near to the
                bed, then further away, and finally from a separate room (but not too
                quickly).
             Step: 7.       At this point, you can add further elements to the command. You
                might add a distraction one at a time, such as having another person in the
                room bouncing a ball or setting down your dog's food bowl, and then request
                the "Go To Your Bed."
             Step: 8.       You may add the dog obedience down command to this exercise if
                you like.
             Step: 9.       After a while you should fade and vary your rewards. You can give
                the treat every second or third time your dog goes to his bed, or you could
                throw a ball for him to chase as the reward instead of the tasty treat.

Remember to keep it fun and build the "Go To Your Spot" command piece by piece over a
period of a couple of weeks. If you are consistent and show a little patience, you and your
dog is sure to achieve results.




      [DISCOVER A GREAT PRODUCT HELPING MILLIONS OF DOGS AROUND THE GLOBE]
The “Leave It” Command
      The dog obedience training command "Leave It" is an excellent one to teach your
puppy or older dog. You'll be amazed at how frequently you'll use this command.

      The "Leave It" command comes in handy in a variety of circumstances. The "Leave It"
command is ideal if you're out for a walk and your dog attempts to eat animal droppings
(coprophagia) off the grass or if you find him grabbing a cookie off the coffee table.

      You can start teaching the command "Leave It" at any moment. It's just as important
as the other fundamental obedience instructions like sit, down, come, and stay.

      To make your "Leave It" command, follow the guidelines below. There will be no need
to tug and pull against your dog with the leash since you will have your dog under voice
control.


The Seven-Step Guide:
We'll start by building the behavior, then add our vocal "Leave It" signal, and ultimately
generalize the behavior.

           Step: 1. Sit down in front of your dog in a comfortable setting devoid of
              distractions (such as other people or animals).


           Step: 2. Put an ordinary "Leave It" treat (kibble or some other plain dry treat) in
              one hand and your dog's favorite "jackpot!" treat in the other (liver, hotdog,
              cheese etc.).


           Step: 3. Extend your hand out towards your dog with the ordinary "Leave It" treat
              sitting on your open palm. Don't say a single word. Close your hand quickly
              when your dog reaches forward to take the treat, don't let him get it. If he loses
              interest, say "Yes!" and pass over the jackpot treat with your other hand. If he's
              very desperate to get the kibble treat in your closed fist, simply keep it out of his
              reach and ignore him.
Step: 4. Repeat Step 3 around 10 seconds after the first time. If he doesn't dive
   right in after the "Leave It" treat, joyfully shout "Yes!" and give him a loving
   scratch behind the ear with the jackpot tasty treat from your other hand. Close
   your fingers over it again if he goes for the ordinary "Leave It" treat right
   immediately. He'll probably glance up at you with a perplexed, curious way,
   which is a good thing. As soon as his focus is diverted away from the treat,
   exclaim "Yes!" and offer him the jackpot treat while praising his efforts.


Step: 5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 as many times as needed (repetition and
   consistency are two of the most important aspects of dog training!). Your dog
   will soon figure out that if he refuses the boring old "Leave It" treat, he will be
   rewarded with a massive "jackpot" treat from the other hand.


Step: 6. Now that your dog has a basic understanding of the action, it's time to
   add your vocal "Leave It" command. This allows us to request the behavior
   whenever the situation calls for it. Continue practicing as usual, only this time
   say "Leave It" while you extend your hand (the one with the ordinary reward)
   towards the dog. In your dog's mind, this stage establishes a link between you
   saying "Leave It" and him leaving an object alone.


Step: 7. It's time to add some more variables now that you have the behavior and
   it's on cue. This phase generalizes and validates the "leave it" command so that
   we may use it in any situation. Introduce the new ingredients indicated below
   one at a time, being careful not to rush your dog.
   •   While practicing the Leave It command hold your hand in different positions - close to
       the ground, up at your dog's eye level etc...
   •   Hold off with saying "Yes" and giving the jackpot treat until your dog actually looks
       you in the eye.
   •   Put the ordinary treat straight down onto the ground in front of your dog and say
       "Leave It”, if your dog goes for the treat quickly cover it with your foot.
   •   Take your training sessions into other rooms and eventually outside.
   •   Say "Leave It" when you are at varying distances from your dog.
   •   Practice in the presence of distractions such as other people and dogs.
   •   Practice when you are out on your daily walk, with your dog on leash drop some treats
       on the ground and then walk past them.

Leave It is a highly helpful command for your dog to learn, and it won't take long to teach.
Keep in mind that leaving the object alone should be a more appealing option for your dog
than going for it.




    [DISCOVER A GREAT PRODUCT HELPING MILLIONS OF DOGS AROUND THE GLOBE]
The “Stand” Command
The stand command is a very handy behavior for you and your dog to have in your
repertoire. The stand command is a behavior you will call on in many different situations. It's
great when you visit your Veterinarian or dog groomer. You'll also call on the stand command
when bathing your dog and clipping his/her nails. It's also the best position for your dog to be
in if you require him to stay for long periods.

       We always begin by teaching any new command or behavior in a familiar location that
is devoid of distractions. Make learning the stand command as easy as possible for your dog,
and then we can introduce some additional variables.


The Six-Step Guide
The first step is to reward as many instances of the "stand" behavior as possible, through
shaping it or simply letting it occur naturally.

To begin with you should teach the stand command when your dog is in a sitting position and
then from the laying down position.

          Step: 1. Gather a few tempting treats in your hand to entice your dog into
             the standing position. Your dog's nose will be drawn to the treat you're holding.
             Hold the treat a few inches in front of your dog's nose while he or she is seated.
             After that, carefully pull it away horizontally (parallel to the ground). At this
             point, there's no need to say anything to your dog. If your dog responds to this
             bait by rising to his feet and standing, give him a treat and some enthusiastic
             praise right away. NOTE: If your dog refuses to follow your food bait, you may
             urge him verbally or gently prod him with your finger to get him moving.


          Step: 2. Repeat and practice the food targeting exercise, rewarding a desired
             answer each time.


          Step: 3. The next stage is to get the stand behavior without using food as a bait,
             from now on, food will only be used as a reward. You do this by continuing as
             usual, but this time without any food in your hand. So now you place your empty
             hand in front of your dog's nose and gently move it away from it horizontally.
             Even without the treat, 9 out of 10 dogs will continue to follow your hand. If
             your dog continues to follow, immediately praise and reward him with a treat
             from your other hand just as you have already been doing. If your dog still
             doesn't follow your empty hand, try some verbal encouragement or a little
             nudge with your finger. You can reduce the food incentive after the dog
   consistently follows your empty hand. Set up a flexible food incentive plan for
   your dog. Every second successful stand, then every third, and so on, should be
   rewarded. To keep your dog guessing, mix it up.


Step: 4. You may add your vocal order to the stand exercise once your dog has
   mastered step 3. Basically, we now have the desired action (the stand), and it's
   time to add the verbal signal that will initiate the activity. Say "stand" and then
   continue the process as in step 3. Say "stand," apply your hand signal, then
   praise and treat your dog as soon as he or she gets into the stand posture.
   Repeat this process as many times as needed; any time during the day is a good
   time to practice. This stage helps build up a connection in your
   dog's mind between you saying "stand" and him standing.




Step: 5. It's time to put your hand signal and any other prompting to the side and
   depend only on your vocal cue. Wait for your dog to move after saying "stand."
   It's very likely that your dog will stand in the same position as he did in the
   previous phases. He'll have already made the link between your vocal "stand"
   order and his physical standing. If your dog does not move when you say
   "stand," he or she is not ready for this step. Return to step 4 and practice it once
   more.


Step: 6. Now that you've got the basic stand command solid on vocal command,
   it's time to add some more variables. The goal of this phase is to generalize,
   enhance, and justify the stand command. This means you expand on the original
   command to make it more effective over time, in a variety of settings, and in the
   face of additional distractions.
Everyone’s Favorite: “Fetch”
One of the most common commands that owners wish to teach their dogs is fetch, often
known as retrieve. A brief game of fetch is a great way for a dog's innate prey drive to be
released, and it calms even the most energetic of dogs. In addition, it's also one of the few
interactive games you can play with your dog. It's a great method to enhance the relationship
between humans and dogs.

       Most dogs like chasing a ball and returning it to you, but many dogs require some
training to achieve a desirable level of behavior. At first, your dog may be a natural or
hesitant retriever, but most dogs like playing a game of fetch after a while. Why wouldn't
they? It's a lot of fun!

       It takes a few different stages to teach a rock solid and dependable retrieve. The steps
below will teach your dog to be interested in an object, to charge after it when it is thrown, to
pick it up, return it to you, and to put it at your feet. All of this accomplished without any
skylarking, sniffing, hesitating, or diversions!
The Five-Step Guide

Step 1:
Let's begin with a basic and enjoyable game. Sit down on the floor with your dog in a small
room devoid of distractions. In one hand, hold a little squeaky toy, while the other holds
some appetizing treats. The toy should ideally be one that your dog has expressed an interest
in. Toss the toy a short distance away from yourself (still within your reach) and let your
puppy pounce on it, you may encourage your dog if necessary. As soon as your dog takes the
toy, reach out and take it from his or her mouth while shouting "good puppy." As soon as you
get your hands on the toy, you must replace it by giving your dog a treat.

Use the treat as a bribe if your puppy won't let go of the toy. Hold the treat right in front of
his nose and wait for him to drop the toy. As soon as the toy drops from his mouth, praise
your dog and give him the treat. At least a couple of times a day, practice this easy game in
5-minute intervals. This is the first and most important stage in teaching your dog how to
fetch or retrieve.

Step 2.
We will now resume the game we started in Step 1, but this time will include a release phrase
or signal. Say "thank you" or "thanks" as you remove the toy from your puppy's mouth (or as
he drops it in your lap) and immediately offer the treat and praise, exactly as you did in Step
1. Repeat this procedure several times to help your dog form a mental link between your
"thanks" cue and the act of him giving you the toy. You won't have to grab the toy from your
dog's mouth after a lot of work and constant reinforcement (treats), he will deliver it to you
when you say your cue word. Now we have got the basic fetch behavior we are trying to
shape, we just need to build on it a little more.

Step 3.
We may now gradually (but not too slowly) increase the retrieval distance. Start by throwing
the toy a few meters away, hoping that your dog would pounce on it and bring it back to you
for a treat. Continue as before, say your release cue "thank you" and give the treat for each
successful retrieval. Important: Do not chase or create a fuss if your dog does not return the
toy to you. Simply sit and wait till he returns it to you, then treat as usual. Your goal is to
communicate to your dog that he must return the toy to you in order for the fun and games
to continue. Finish the game and try again later if your dog doesn't bring the toy back to you.
Next time go back to the shorter and easier retrieve game from Step 1
Step 4.
Repeat the fetch game as many times necessary. The key to developing and strengthening a
strong retrieve is repetition and positive reinforcement. You may now vary the length of time
you throw the toy and move your training sessions into different rooms within the house.
When you add a new object to the game, such as a ball (which you'll use for a game of fetch
in the dog park), you should start at a short distance and gradually increase it. Always reward
and congratulate your dog when the retrieve object is delivered to you.

Step 5.
That's the retrieval behavior in 4 steps. You can now start the exercise with a cue. Just before
you toss the ball, simply say "fetch" or "get it." After a while, your dog will look straight up at
you when you say "fetch" and anticipate a pursuit.

You may now fade the treats out gradually. Your dog will be satisfied just by playing the
game. Instead of a tasty treat, your dog will be motivated to return the ball right back to you
by the next throw of the ball.

The retrieve is an excellent activity to teach most dogs, and working through the 5 steps
mentioned above will only take a few days. Pretty soon you will have an eager dog who drops
the ball at your feet at any opportunity!

Module 16: Training Dogs –
More on How Dogs Learn
Module 16 will explore the following topics:


     House training your dog
     Teaching commands
     Four words to live by
     How your dog reads body language
     Grooming training



16.1 Introduction
Dogs learn through operant conditioning and there are certain
natural reinforcements you can use during training exercises
to help your dog succeed.

Remember that your dog will learn through the timing and
frequency of rewards, and from other pets and people, and that
dogs are not all the same.
All of these points (from Module 12) are extremely important
as you begin obedience training with your puppy or dog.



16.2 House Training Your Puppy
Any form of training your puppy or dog
undergoes requires patience, consistency and
positive reinforcement.




It will take four to six months for your puppy to be fully
house trained based on their growth, ability to learn and
urination control, due to excitement.

Some puppies can take up to a year before they are fully house
trained.

Size is usually a predictor with regards to the length of time
it may take to house train your dog. Smaller breeds naturally
have smaller bladders, with faster metabolisms. Therefore,
they require more trips outside.

The location your puppy or dog previously lived may also be a
factor in how easy it will be to break habits learned at
another location. During training, setbacks may occur.

You should begin training a puppy when it is 12 to 16 weeks of
age. At this stage your puppy has enough control of his
bladder and bowels to learn to hold his need for urination or
bowel movements.

Experts state you need to have a defined space for house
training, whether it is a crate, room or on a leash.
Your puppy needs to understand they must go outside to do
their business. Until the lesson is learned you limit the
amount of freedom your dog has to the rest of your home.

These steps should be followed:

     Give your puppy a regular feeding schedule; do not leave
     food out between meals.
     First thing in the morning, take your dog outside.
     Repeat this every 30 minutes to 60 minutes.
     Take your dog outside after every meal and when he/she
     wakes up from a nap.
     Before you go to bed, take your puppy out.
     Each time you go outside, take your puppy to the same
     location to do his/her business. His scent will prompt
     him to urinate.
     Stay outside with your dog each time he does his
     business, at least until you have your puppy house
     trained.
     Always praise your puppy when he goes to the toilet
     outside. A walk around the neighborhood is a great
     reward.

Petting your dog, rubbing your dog in a favored area or taking
your dog for a walk about after he/she eliminates, are perfect
rewards.

You are using operant conditioning to reinforce the behavior
of holding their bladder until they are outside and toileting
in the correct spot.

Do not reward with a food treat. A treat may seem great at
first, but this can lead to an expectation i.e. if they
perform well by toileting outside and not in the house, they
receive food.
Now, there is always an exception to the treat rule. You can
use operant conditioning, but teach your dog or puppy that
they will not always receive a food treat each time they
eliminate outside. In other words, an occasional treat after
they eliminate outside is acceptable.

You also have to do your part in the training.
Follow the steps as outlined and make certain you are reading
your dog’s communications accurately. Accidents are common
when you do not allow your dog outside as often as needed. If
your dog is sniffing, circling, whining, barking or scratching
at the door, these are signs he needs to go outside.

If you have setbacks, do not stop the training or stop giving
rewards for proper behavior. Operant conditioning is about
providing rewards when good behavior occurs and ignoring the
inappropriate behavior. You do not want to negatively
reinforce the training you are trying to give your dog.
16.3 Teaching Commands
Part of obedience training is teaching your dog or puppy
commands.

The earlier you start to teach your puppy, the better. Your
puppy can start to learn inappropriate behaviors from the
minute it arrives in your home.

Remember, your dog is learning from you and any other pets you
may have.
If there are behaviors you do not want your puppy to adopt,
you need to put a stop to them appropriately. There will be
more in a later section about training out certain behaviors,
but for now we will concentrate on teaching some basic
commands.

How to Teach Sit
You need to be on the same level as your puppy, so either sit
on the floor or in a chair. Hold a treat close to his nose.
Get your puppy to follow the treat with his head as you move
your hand up. As his head moves up, gravity will take over,
his bottom will start to lower, eventually resting on the
floor. As soon as his bottom is on the floor, give the treat
to your dog. Immediately praise your dog. Repeat these steps
several times each day.

The next step is adding a second stimulus to get the response
you want. When you hold the treat, make certain it is at their
level so the dog does not try to jump. You also want to have
your hand closed around the treat, and held just high enough
that your dog will stretch his neck. As your dog sits, you
will give your dog the treat and say “sit.” You will then rub
your dog’s bottom and tell him “good sit.” This reinforces the
behavior you want your dog to have.

Repetition is imperative.
You want to repeat this throughout the day, as well as
throughout their training. Once you get your dog to sit
without a treat and just on your voice command, you will still
need to practice and provide praise. You can forego the treat,
but always make certain you tell your dog “good sit” every
time they sit on your command. You also want him to sit for
other activities.

At each feeding time make your dog sit by the food bowl. When
you are about to open the door to take him out to do his
business or to go for a walk, make him sit at the door. If
he/she gets up, make your dog sit again before you give a
reward. Your dog will learn that sitting at the door is a must
before he/she goes out, thus they receive a reward for going
outside as soon as the behavior “sit” has been completed.

How to Teach a Dog to Come on Demand
Teaching your dog to come when you say, “come” is a
culmination of previous techniques and guidance with the lead.

First, attach a lead to your dog’s collar. It should be light
in weight as you will want your dog to drag it around with
him. Once he is accustomed to the lead, pick up the end. You
will then follow him with the line on his collar; letting your
dog get used to the fact that he/she is attached to you.

You do not have to use the word “come” as a way to get your
dog to come to you. Many people have started using the word
“yes” along with treats to encourage their dogs to come
towards them. It is up to you. If you want to use “come,” then
you can say “come” when he starts to move towards you. Follow
the word by a treat and praise.
Let your dog walk backward or around, but each time he/she
faces you, use the word “come” and provide a treat when he/she
reaches you. Every time your dog responds the way you want
him/her to, while you use the word “come,” you need to praise
your dog.

Once your dog gets the point that there is a reward for coming
towards you, you can start to change the routine. Start
offering fewer treats when an appropriate response is given.
Instead, start increasing the pleasure of praise and
affection. Use the lead to give your dog a signal along with
the word.

You always want to provide just one word and not repeat the
phrase multiple times.
However, you can give a gentle tug to remind your dog that you
two are attached. This will get your dog’s attention back on
you, so he/she knows that you want him/her to come to you.

Always gently guide your dog towards you. Never use a swift or
harsh tug.
You also want to make certain that if your dog does not follow
your “come” command that you are not negatively reinforcing
the behavior to ignore you. A negative consequence or angry
response will affect your animal. You also never want your dog
to “come” and give him/her a punishment. It will confuse your
dog, but also it will teach your dog that if they come to you,
they might get hurt.

How to Teach Stay
“Stay” is an extremely difficult command and behavior to
teach.

Puppies are full of exuberance, so they like to move around
whether it is to follow you or to go and play. “Stay” can be
too difficult a command for some dogs when they want to be
close to you. There are some good ways to teach your dog to
stay. This is especially important as you do not want your dog
to chase a squirrel, bike or a car. You must ensure they are
safe at all times and will stop and stay at your command.

Make certain when you teach your dog how to “Stay” that you
train with important factors in mind. Your dog should
understand that the command is for their safety, and this
happens by you using the command when it is appropriate and
not when you just want to go to another room.

You can later train your dog to stay when you leave a room,
but for now, focus on keeping them safe with the obedience
command.

     You will put a leash on your dog and have him sit in a
     comfortable position next to you.
     Next use a flat palm and wave it toward his muzzle as
     you say “Stay.”
     Step in front of your dog, wait to see if your dog
     moves. Only wait for a few seconds, then step back
     beside him and give your dog a reward if he did not rise
     or move with you.
     If your dog moves, simply take the position again and
     tell him to sit. Give the “Stay” command along with the
     hand signal. Move in front of your dog again.

Do not give your dog a reward if he moves.

This means you will not give your dog a treat, praise or
affectionate pat. You will just have him/her sit again and try
the hand signal with the phrase again.

Practice the same command throughout the day at different
times. Never forget to reward your dog when he stays. You can
praise him, give him a treat or offer affection.

You also need to teach him a release word that means your dog
can move again. This can be the word “Okay” or “Come.” You can
also use a signal such as a different hand waving motion,
perhaps a gesture you teach with the command “Come.”

How to Teach Down
Dogs love to jump but it is not always good behavior.

Your dog can also get into trouble if they are under your
feet. So, while it is difficult to teach your dog to hold in
the excitement, it is necessary. The posture you are asking
your dog to be in is submissive, which makes it doubly hard to
understand.

Always use a happy voice when you teach this command.
As you did with the sit command, hold a treat in your closed
hand and have your hand near your dog’s muzzle. When your dog
notices the scent of the treat, move your hand. You want to
move it towards the floor. Gravity will take care of your dog
to move lower as he/she follows the treat in your hand. You
will want to move your hand in front of him/her along the
floor, while the head follows your treat-filled hand. The body
will follow and he/she will stretch down.

When your dog is down, give him/her the treat.

Repeat the process.

Repetition will always make the appropriate response happen
again. If your dog tries to get the treat without going down,
simply shake your head indicating “No” and say “Nope” out
loud. If your dog breaks the position, start over again. You
should never push your dog down. Your dog will eventually get
the point that the treat is given when he follows what you
ask.

This is the operant conditioning part of training your dog
with commands. The repetition is also necessary to ensure the
lessons stay in their mind. Remember, you have to give the
treat as soon as the appropriate behavior is seen and repeat
the training frequently to ensure it holds.



16.4 Your Dog Reads Body Language
More than the words you say to your dog,
your dog is looking at your actions.




Every move you make during training is a gesture to your
dog. How they interpret that gesture will determine if they
stay in the training position you are currently working on.

Whenever you like a behavior, you must reinforce with a happy
response, such as “that’s good” while rewarding by touch or
treat.

You always want to provide proper positive reinforcement, as
this entices your dog to learn more.


16.5 Training for Grooming
Grooming is not something most dogs like.

They would rather play, be close to you and get affection.
Your dog will allow you to groom them with a brush, clip their
nails and even bathe them, because there is a reward in it for
them.

The trick is teaching the reward with the obedience you wish
to see.

Start off slowly with grooming.
Let your dog smell the utensils you will be using. If they are
new, there will be a new scent about them, which could affect
your dog. A good idea is to use treats to help overcome the
new scent. For a brush you could find a clump of hair that
came from your dog and rub it into the brush. By associating
the equipment with your dog they are more likely to accept the
new objects.
Ask your dog to sit. Ask them to stay. Start with the brush.
If they like it they will enjoy the attention. If not, you may
need to reinforce their still behavior, with your hands
petting and rubbing them.

Once the brush is learned, the next part is teaching your dog
to give you a paw. Like the other commands learned, repeat by
using the gesture you associate with the dog to give you
his/her paw. Usually you want to hold out your hand and place
your dog’s paw in it. Do this just a few inches off the
ground. Give your dog a treat.

Next time hold out your hand and wait for the paw to be placed
in yours. If this happens, give a treat. If not, do the
gesture again until the paw is placed in your hand. Keep
increasing the level of your hand and the paw. Always provide
praise or a treat. When your dog is ready, raise the clippers
and try to clip one nail. If they move away, be patient, wait
for the paw, praise, and then clip the nail. If they allow you
to clip a nail, reward your dog by saying “good” in a happy
voice and with a treat.

Soon your dog will realize you want their paw and they will
receive a reward for the process of having their nails
clipped.




Summary
In this module, you learned how to train your dog with
obedience training pointers, as well as how to start grooming
your dog.

You now realize that training your dog entails much work, with
necessary repetition of various stages.

You also know that if there are two parts to the commands or
behavior you want to see, you need to teach your dog the
proper response in stages.

Training your dog is about repetition, patience and
reinforcement of the behavior over a long period of time, not
just one training session.

You and your dog will train together, with positive
reinforcement, whether natural or through praise and treats.

You also know that you retrain your dog through reinforcing
proper behavior and ignoring bad behaviors.

Your Dog’s Diet, Nutrition & Health

Dear reader.

Thanks for downloading Your Dog’s Diet and Nutrition - The Ultimate Guide.

Over a span of 15,000 years, the dog has been domesticated. Now, our canine friend
has become an integral part of our lives and has performed many important roles: a
guard, a hunter, a companion, a protector, a friend and even a warrior.

As time passed, we have begun to accept this friend as a member of our family and
also treat him as one.

Like their human owners, dogs need sufficient calories to meet their daily needs for
growth, activity, repair and maintaining optimal health. You can provide these with the
correct combination of fats, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water in a
balanced diet.

Regarding food habits, some sources describe dogs as carnivores. Other sources
describe dogs as omnivores, despite their descent from wolves. Unlike the feline
family, with their shorter small intestine, a dog is neither dependent on meat-specific
protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill its basic dietary requirements.

Dogs are able to healthily digest a variety of foods, including vegetables and grains,
and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet. In the wild, canines often eat
available plants and fruits.

Let’s delve into what dogs ate in the past. Even fifty years ago, most pet dogs thrived
on table scraps. No one probably paid attention to the fact that dogs have their own
calorie requirements. And twenty-five years ago, the cereal companies dominated the
supermarkets and agricultural feed stores and pet foods could hardly be seen.

Somewhere along the line we started paying a lot more attention to our pet’s diet and
nutrition.

Today, the super-stores that cater for pets have a baffling array of dry premium foods,
convenient semi-moist packets, canned foods, and gourmet diets for puppies, adult
dogs, old dogs, show dogs, hunting dogs, high-energy working dogs, lean dogs, fat
dogs, pregnant dogs, lactating dogs and special food for different breeds of dogs.
There are too many choices that can leave even the most seasoned dog owner
absolutely puzzled.

To add to the confusion, there are hoards of hyped-advertisements claiming the
benefits of this or that food. “All natural”, “real meat”, “non-allergenic”, “high protein”,
“low protein”, “low-fat”, “no by-products”, “your dog will love it” . . .




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                      2
The claim on a bag of dog food is that it’s a complete food, which means nothing
unless the nutrients are in a form available for absorption into the dog’s system.

Major dog food companies make every effort to not only balance their food but also to
provide the ingredients in usable form. These make every effort to provide balanced
proportions of vitamins and minerals for maximum benefit to the dog.

The fact that the quality of the ingredients added, storage methods, processing
temperatures, humidity etc. can cause variations in the quality of the dog food, every
dog has its own individual need. One dog food may suit a dog very well, but the same
dog food may not be good enough for another dog.

Particular breeds or a particular line of dogs within a breed, or other dog groups may
require slightly different percentages of particular nutrients. Therefore, all dog foods
are not perfect for all dogs. This fact has leads to the production of a plethora of
different foods, claims, and processing methods.

Then, there is another group of people with opinions: It’s cooked, it contains chemicals,
it causes allergies, they use road-kill and animals, not fit for human consumption,
cause bloat, low in nutrition. . . and it’s a wonder that anyone can choose.

To add to all this, is the series of pet food recalls, starting from 2007 – that leaves the
concerned dog owners worried and perplexed.

On March 16, 2007, Menu Foods announced a nationwide recall of more than 40
popular brands of pet food. The products—including well-known brands like Iams,
Eukanuba, Purina and Science Diet—were causing severe, and often fatal, kidney
problems in dogs and cats.

Nearly 180 brands of wet and dry food were eventually added to the recall list,
provoking a tense period of uncertainty for pets, pet parents and animal welfare
professionals.

Yet another school of thought promotes home-cooked foods for dogs from meat,
vegetables and cereals. While that definitely ensures the safety and hygiene of the
food that your dog eats, the common pet owner wonders, will that provide my dog with
adequate nutrients and minerals?

In order to ensure that a homemade diet will suffice for your dog, you will need to be
extremely particular that the final product includes a complete nutritional balance. It is
very important to follow recipe directions exactly, not allowing for substitutions or
omitting ingredients.

Your dog’s health and longevity are our prime concern.

So, we decided to develop this e-book package on Dog Diet and Nutrition, in
consultation with renowned canine nutritionists, vets and dog experts. Our intention is
to show you the right path for your dog’s diet, get to know what the experts are saying
and then to choose the best possible option for you and your dog.

This e-book package provides you with a whole lot of information on the essential
nutrients, reading a dog food label, how to shift to a new food / diet; dog treats and
chews, feeding schedules, specific needs at specific ages of the dog…and more.

Chapter One: Introduction


Every dog owner whether it is their first puppy or their tenth, shares a common concern
about their dog. That concern is their dog’s diet and making sure that their dog is
getting everything he needs to be healthy and active throughout his life.


It can be a major challenge for dog owners and one of the biggest hurdles is the lack of
information that is out there. People just don’t understand dog food or dog nutrition
and much of the information that they can dredge up tends to contradict the rest.


The simple fact is that dog nutrition is not an open and shut topic. It isn’t as easy as
going down to the pet store and pick out the most expensive dog food. No matter how
expensive a dog food is, there is no guarantee that it is meeting the nutritional needs of
your dogs.


In fact, many dog foods that are sold in pet stores are pushed onto the consumer. Dog
food companies offer incentives to pet stores if they sell their products so many times,
the best food that is recommended is not always the “best” food.


Years ago, I heard a saying, “Since a dog is your responsibility, the food and the
quality of what he eats is also your responsibility.”


The responsibility goes farther than simply putting out the food or limiting the table
scraps, it goes into taking the time and effort to research and understand the needs of
your pet and what goes into a dog food.


It is about ensuring that your dog is getting everything he needs and that he is being
limited on the empty calories that we often give our dogs. It isn’t an easy job, at least
at the beginning, but as you become more confident in your knowledge about your
dog’s diet and nutrition, it becomes second nature.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    8
And that is what this book is about. It is a comprehensive guide that looks at the world
of dog food and dog nutrition. It takes you through everything your dog needs when it
comes to nutrition and then it looks at finding the right dog food and dog food
manufacturer.


In addition, this book looks at the different types of dog foods out there, what goes into
making each one and also how to determine the best brands on the market right now.
It answers important questions on reading labels, analyzing protein and fat
percentages and the difference between homemade and commercial made dog foods.


That information in itself will help you move forward to a better diet for your dog but I
wanted to provide my readers with more information than just the basics.


I wanted to give you the tools to feed your dog throughout their life, from puppy hood to
their later years and everything in between. I wanted to provide a guide that offered
you advice on feeding your dog when she was sick, pregnant or simply nursing a litter.
And that is what I managed to gather together and deliver in this book.


It covers everything that you could possibly want to know about feeding a dog. It takes
you through switching foods, creating a feeding schedule and even feeding your
canine when you are traveling. I have designed this book to be the ultimate resource
when it comes to your dog’s nutrition and I hope that you find it as informative as I
have tried to make it.


I have always felt that the best life for my dog starts with the food I placed in his bowl
and I still feel that today, decades after purchasing my very first bowl. While I can’t
help you with some of the trials and tribulations of owning a dog, with this book, I can
help you with giving your dog the essential ingredients for a long and healthy life.

Chapter Two: Dog Diet and Nutrition Basics


Before we get into actually feeding your dog, we should get into the basics of what
nutrition is. For many owners, dog nutrition is a mystical science. We know that it is
important for our dogs to get the proper vitamins, minerals and fats but we don’t know
how this happens or even if we need to do something special to get it. Nutritional
knowledge is out of our grasp and we tend to rely on the dog food manufacturers to tell
us what is best and what isn’t.

Of course, it doesn’t have to be that way and dog food nutrition can be very easy to
grasp if you know the basics.



Protein
Protein is one of the most important parts of a dog’s diet and is usually the key
ingredient in a dog food, whether it is homemade or processed. Protein is used by the
body to build and repair muscles, along with growth and development. In addition,
protein is important for energy and stamina and the overall appearance of your dog,
including his skin and coat which is affected by the protein in his diet. When you are
looking at daily percentages, 25% of the daily amount of calories should be made up
with protein.




Carbohydrates
Although protein does provide energy, it is really the carbohydrates that give your dog
the most energy that he needs. This is also the part of his diet that is converted to
sugars and stored in the body when it is needed. Too many carbohydrates and your
dog can become overweight but too few and he won’t have the energy he needs to get
through the day. On average, carbohydrates should take up about 40 to 60% of a
dog’s daily calorie intake.



Fat

Fat is another important part of your dog’s diet and it is usually listed on the dog food
label under Crude Fat. When we are looking at fats, we are actually looking at omega
fats. These fats promote a healthy coat and they offer a dog many different health
benefits including the prevention of allergies and some infections. Fat should take up
about 20 to 35% of a dog’s daily calorie intake.

Calories

Although every dog is different, and his calorie needs will change depending on the
amount of exercise he has and his size and lifestyle, there is a general
recommendation as to the amount of calories that a dog should have. It is important to
note   that    you   can    find   a    more    comprehensive   calorie   calculator   at
http://www.trainpetdog.com/calorie-calculator.html but below is an abbreviated
chart on how many calories your dog should have.

Vitamins and Minerals

All dogs need vitamins and minerals and they are used by the dog’s body for a range
of functions. Kidney health, bone formation, and coat health are only a few of the areas
that vitamins and minerals aid and promote. The dog food you purchase should offer
many of the vitamins and minerals your dog needs and if they don’t, you can use a
multi-vitamin supplement to boost your dog’s levels for optimal health. The vitamins
and minerals that every dog should have in his diet are:

   §   Calcium

Calcium

Although calcium is listed with minerals, it is important to mention it separately.
Calcium is an important part of your dog’s diet, especially when it comes to puppies.
Calcium aids in growth development and bone formation. In addition, calcium in a
dog’s diet keeps the bones strong and ensures a lifetime of good health.



Water

You can’t really talk about nutrition without mentioning water
since this is a very important part of a dog’s diet. Without
water, a dog can suffer from serious problems including
kidney and bladder diseases. A dog should have constant
access to fresh water and it should be one part of your dog’s
food that isn’t on a schedule.


In addition, puppies should receive plenty of water but until they are housetrained, they
should be limited to water only at certain times of the day.


And there are the basics of nutrition, although we have a lot more in this book that will
give you an inside look at feeding your dog.

Chapter Three: Choosing the Right Food for Your Dog


Okay, you are probably wondering right now, how on earth you are going to choose
the right food for your dog. There just seems to be so much information and really,
how can you interpret everything that you read on the internet to make an informed
decision.


Thankfully, this book has been designed to help you in determining the right food for
your dog and while I can’t tell you which dog food to purchase, I can give you the tools
you need to make an informed choice.         In this chapter, I will go over all of the
wonderful information that you find on a dog food package and how to figure it out.



The AAFCO Standards

AAFCO, or the Association of American Feed Control Officials, is an association that
sets out the desired nutritional values that should be found in pet food. They set
standards on how the food is prepared, stored and the type of food that should be
used in the pet food. In addition, they require all dog foods to be labeled properly and
they should meet the standards that have been set into place.


AAFCO, also sets the daily nutritional values for dogs and in 2008, they determined a
list of maximum daily allowances on specific minerals and vitamins. The reason for
this was because many dog foods were exceeding the recommended amounts and
dogs were being given an overdose of several vitamins, which resulted in serious
illnesses.


When you are purchasing a dog food, it is very important to choose a dog food that
has been approved by the AAFCO. If there is no approval on the label, then don’t
purchase the dog food. Below is a list of nutritional values set in place by AAFCO.

Reading a Dog Food Label

Before you purchase your dog food, it is important to read the label. There are a
number of items that you should look for including the name and contact information of
the company, the nutritional value and the net quantity statement. It can be difficult to




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                   17
manage but once you get the hang of reading the label, you will be able to quickly
assess whether a dog food is high quality or just pretending to be.

Interpreting from the Product Name

What’s in a name? If you actually think about it, a lot is in the name of a dog food. In
fact, there are strict rules about the name and what it claims to offer a dog. This helps
consumers a great deal since many companies find fanciful ways to label a product to
make it appealing to us.


The first thing that you should realize is that AAFCO has set up four rules when it
comes to labeling dog food. The overall rule is that the main ingredients in the dog
food should be mentioned in the product name. So a wet dog food could be “Beef dog
food” or a dry kibble could be Lamb and Rice Formula. This gives consumers a fair
idea of what the ingredients are before they even turn over the label.


The four rules are:


"95%" rule:


This rule means that any product that consists primarily of meat, such as beef, chicken
or lamb, should have a name that identifies the meat. This usually applies to wet dog
food and the percentage of meat, not counting water, should be the highest
percentage in the ingredients list. In addition, it should be indicated in the product
name.


"Dinner" rule:


The dinner rule is used for both wet and dry dog food and it is always seen with some
form of “dinner” in the product name. So a “Beef Dinner for dogs” usually means that
over 25% but less than 95% of the ingredients is beef. This can be tricky because this
doesn’t mean that the main ingredient is a meat and it could be further down the
ingredient list. When you are purchasing a “dinner” or “formula”, make sure you check
the ingredients list.



        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  18
“With” rule:


When you see the word “with” in the product name, you know that the “with” represents
3% of the total ingredients. So “Rice with Lamb” means that there is only 3% lamb in
the total food and the main ingredient is going to be rice. What this really means is
that the “with” means there isn’t enough of the meat to constitute having “dinner” in the
name and it is important to check the ingredients list to see what the primary ingredient
is in the dog food.


“Flavor” rule:


The last rule is when you see the word flavor in a product name. This means that
there is only enough of the meat to add flavor to the food but it doesn’t offer any
nutrients. In fact, many times, flavor is added by using by-products and meals.



Manufacturer’s Name and Contact Information

On all dog foods, there will be a statement that identifies the manufacturer and, in
some cases, the company that distributed the dog food. There should be an address,
with full mailing information, and there should be a listing in the phone book so you can
contact them if necessary. Many manufacturers offer a toll-free number for customers
to contact them with concerns or questions. Make sure your dog food has all this
information since it may be important later on.

Net Quantity Statement

Usually with the manufacturer information is the net quantity statement. This is the
statement that tells you exactly how much food is in the dog food container. It can be
confusing since some dog foods are denser than others and actually take up more
room in the bag. When you are checking the net quantity statement, make sure you
compare it to other products. Remember that one type of dog food may only have 35




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  19
pounds of food in it, while the other of the same size and shape, may have closer to 40
pounds.

Ingredient List

One item that most people check is the ingredient list on the dog food. There is usually
a misconception that this is all you need to check but you shouldn’t stop here. In
regards to the ingredients list, the ingredients are listed in order of most weight. So the
foods with the greatest weight will be at the top of the label. This usually equates to
the ingredient that has the greatest quantity in the dog food but it is not always the
case. Meats have a high level of water and this can add weight to it, bumping it up on
the ingredients list, therefore, a good rule of thumb is to purchase a dog food that has
more than one type of meat listed first, before any of the grain ingredients.

Guaranteed Analysis

All dog foods should have a guaranteed analysis, although they all differ on what they
are analyzing. Some foods simply guarantee the crude protein, fat, fiber and moisture,
while others give you a list of minerals and vitamins that are in the dog food.


It is important to note whether the guaranteed analysis says "as fed" or "as is". The
former indicates that these percentages are per serving as you feed your dog. The
latter indicates that the total percentage is for the entire bag of dog food, which can be
very deceptive.


When you are reading the guaranteed analysis, it is better to do a quick math of the
percentage to the dry matter in the dog food. Dry matter is the reverse of the moisture
level found in the dog food. So the moisture level of 15 means that there is a dry
matter ratio of 85. Once you have your dry matter, you would divide the dry matter into
the percentage, for instance, into the crude protein percentage, to get your total
amount of protein. For example, if you have 15% protein and 94% dry matter, the
basic math would be 15 (protein) ÷ 94 (dry matter) = 16% protein in the dog food.


This equation can be used with all of the nutritional values to determine exactly what
the dog food offers.



        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    20
Nutritional Adequacy Statement

The nutritional adequacy statement identifies if the food is able to provide sole nutrition
to a dog and also explains what stage of life the dog food is designed for. It is an
important statement since they need to meet strict guidelines to be able to claim
anything listed in a nutritional adequacy statement.


This is done in two ways. The first is through the ingredients list, which should contain
ingredients that are formulated to provide certain levels of nutrients. These ingredients
are recommended by the National Research Council and established by AFFCO. The
second way is for the food to go through AAFCO feeding trials. This is a series of tests
where the dog food is fed under strict guidelines and found to be adequate in providing
a healthy food for dogs.

Feeding Directions

Feeding directions are found on all dog food labels and should have the weight of a
dog and the amount of cups for that weight. In some instances, the dog food has the
age of the dog on it as well as the weight and the amount; however, this is not always
the case. While the feeding directions give you some idea of how much food your dog
will be eating, they are not to be followed exactly since dog food manufacturers need
to make a blanket feeding direction that covers a wide range of dogs. Breed, exercise,
and environment are not factored into the feeding directions and all three can greatly
influence the amount of food you give your dog.

Calorie Statement

A calorie statement is not always seen on a label but if it is, it should be done with a
“kilocalories per kilogram,” basis. What this means is that for every 2.2 pounds of dog
food, which equals a kilogram, you are given the exact number of calories that are in
the   food.    Generally, manufacturers make           calorie   statements   by familiar
measurements such as by the cup.




How cheap dog food compares to expensive foods




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    21
When it comes to cheap and expensive dog foods, many people feel that more
expensive is best. However, that is not always the case and it is very important to read
through the labels to determine if the food has everything you want it to offer.


Usually though, cheap dog food contains more fillers and additives that can affect a
dog negatively. They usually require more food to meet the nutritional and calorie
needs of the dog and even then, the dog often suffers from deficiencies.


Expensive foods, on the other hand, usually have higher quality ingredients and are
usually higher in meat levels, which aids in the overall health of the dog.


In the end, the type of dog food you choose is up to you but it is important to be aware
of the options you have and to read the labels before you purchase.

Chapter Four: 9 Best Commercial Dog Foods

CHOOSING THE TOP NINE FOODS


Even with the major 2007 pet food recalls and some subsequent dog food and treat
recalls, commercial dog foods happen to be the most popular form of dog food in the
market.


There are four primary reasons behind this:


   ü You're not interested in cooking


   ü Using commercial dog food is convenient


   ü You may not be confident that the home-cooked food would provide your dog
       with the appropriate nutritional balance.


   ü You have tried giving your dog home cooked food, but he enjoys the taste of
       the commercial dog food better.


When commercial dog food is the most popular choice, we decided to help our readers
by sharing our findings after extensive research on commercial dog food.


In this section, we have discussed a selection of nine dog food brands.


These nine brands of commercial dog food are of very high quality and will meet the
dietary requirements of your pooch. They are considered some of the best in the
market today.


They use the best ingredients available, ensure safe and hygienic manufacturing
systems, provide proper packaging and take pride in delivering the best option in dog
food to their customers.



          Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.            23
While selecting these 9 commercial dog foods, we have researched from various
sources to ascertain that they provide the best nutrients and balance that your dog
requires. These manufacturers all follow the AAFCO standards as well as other
government regulations placed upon them.


Their ingredients, guaranteed analysis and benefits have been listed such that dog
owners, like you, can make an informed decision. In order to help you find them, we
have even listed from where these dog foods are available.


For the sake of diversity and to give you an idea about the available options in the
market, we have listed dog foods from a range of brands; different from the commonly
used household names.


This will help you get an idea of the variations that are available, in case you decide to
go with something other than the brands you are feeding now.


However, we would always recommend you to consult your vet first, before deciding to
change your dog’s food. You must be cautious about feeding new food or changing
your dog’s diet. Compare these foods to one another and then to what your dog’s
needs are, discuss with your vet about his nutritional needs and then decide, exactly
which brand to choose.

Chapter Five: Different Types of Dog Food


Now that we have looked at the labels, the basics of nutrition and some of the more
popular dog food brands on the market, it is time to look at the different kinds of dog
foods. If you were thinking that your choice was limited to wet and dry, you are only
partially right. There are only wet and dry dog foods but there are also a number of
different types of diets that can make choosing a dog food difficult.

Processed Food vs. Homemade Food


When it comes right down to it, a lot has changed over the last few decades in the
world of dog food. More and more people are becoming aware of the choices that they
have and they are beginning to branch out into homemade foods for their pets. While
one may think that homemade food was limited to treats, there are a number of
homemade dog foods available which will make the choice that much easier.


Of course, there are some positives and negatives about both and I will go over each
of these below:


Processed Food:


One of the biggest pros for the processed food is the convenience. It doesn’t have to
be prepared and it comes in its own storage container.           In addition, the food is
approved by AAFCO and there is thought put into providing the right blend of nutrients
for a dog.


On the other hand, processed food has a number of by-products, chemicals and
additives that have been linked to cancers. They are often filled with fillers that are not
needed and are usually unhealthy for a dog. In addition, the cost of processed food is
quite high and this is often the main reason why people switch to homemade.


Homemade Diet:



        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    43
When we look at the homemade diet, we see many benefits, which are discussed in
more detail in chapter six. If a proper diet is followed, a dog receives all of the nutrients
they need for a healthy life and they generally eat less and even empty their bowels
less.


In addition to the benefits to the dog, they are usually less expense if the owner does
the homemade food properly.


However, if a proper diet isn’t followed, a dog can be malnourished. In addition, it can
be difficult to prepare the meal as it is not one of the more convenient ways to feed
your dog.



Wet vs. Dry Foods


There is often a big debate on whether wet food or dry food is better for a dog and
when it comes down to it, it really is a matter of choice. Below are the pros and cons
of both wet and dry dog foods.


Wet:


Many experts agree that wet dog food is actually a better food since it contains higher
meat content than dry dog food. In addition, canned wet dog food often has fewer
preservatives than dry food and this helps prevent some serious illnesses linked with
those preservatives.


In addition, a wet dog food allows a dog to be better hydrated and this reduces the risk
of urinary tract infections.


On the other hand, wet dog food is more expensive, when you look at quantity and
quality. Dog’s that eat wet food often have more gas and bowel movements and this
alone can make the choice for dry easy.


        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                      44
Dry:


As I mentioned, dry food generally has more additives and preservatives, which makes
it less healthy than wet, although you can buy holistic blends. However, if you are
looking at quantity, it is usually less expensive than wet and it offers your dog a hard
food that will clean his teeth and give his jaw exercise.


In addition, good quality dry dog foods can decrease the amount of bowel movements
your dog makes and can also reduce gas, although this isn’t always the case.


Many experts agree that providing a dog with a mixture of wet and dry, usually with
75% dry and 25% wet is the best way to offer a perfect dog food blend to your dog.




Regular Foods vs. Diet Foods vs. Prescription Diet


When it comes to a diet food or a prescription diet as opposed to regular foods, I tend
to avoid comparing them. Yes there are marked differences but I think it is more
important to look at what is best for your dog.


Generally, a diet food or a prescription diet is given under the direction of your
veterinarian. This means that they are working in the best interest for your dog and
there are extenuating circumstances for the new diet.


Although there is little doubt that a diet or prescription diet is more expensive, it is for
the best interest of your dog to take him off his regular diet if his veterinarian
recommends it.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                     45
Natural Dog Foods


I am actually a big fan of natural dog foods since they offer you the convenience of a
processed dog food without many of the additives and by-products that other
processed dog foods give you. However, it is important to check the dog food before
you purchase it because many holistic foods are not as “organic” as they claim to be.


When you use a natural dog food, you usually have the added benefits of a healthier
dog. Allergy problems are usually reduced and many holistic dog foods have a higher
meat ratio than grain.




Vegetarian and Vegan Dog Foods


If you are looking for a controversial dog food, then you will probably find it with a
vegetarian diet. There are many people that are for this option but there are others
that stress the history of dogs as carnivores and feel that it isn’t’ the best diet for
canines. However, studies have shown that dogs can live a full and healthy life on a
vegan diet without the use of any supplements.


Generally, vegan diets are holistic and do not offer any type of meat, whether it is a
meat flavor or a meat by-product. They are strictly vegan and they have been linked to
a decreased risk of many diseases including cancer, strokes and heart attacks in dogs.


It is important to follow the same recommendations for reading a label that you would
with a meat-based diet and to also find a vegan diet that has been approved by
AAFCO for the best nutrition for your dog.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                46
Benefits of Fruits and Vegetables


Since we are on the topic of vegan eating, it is
important to note that there are many benefits
to feeding your dog fruits and vegetables. It is
also important to realize that not all vegetables
and fruits are good for dogs so before you
choose one to serve your canine pet, make
sure you read chapter twelve on dangerous
foods.


Having said that, studies have found that vegetables and fruits work very well as
antioxidants for dogs; this means that providing fruits and vegetables gives your dog a
lower risk of developing many forms of cancers.


In addition, green and yellow vegetables have been linked to a lower risk of bladder
cancers and some fruits, such as cranberries lower the risk of bladder infections.


When it comes to the benefits, a good rule of thumb is to look at the benefits of any
fruit or vegetable for you. If there is a benefit for you, then chances are, it is the same
benefit for your dog.




Human Food


I remember when I was younger, my family used to give our dogs a big slop bucket of
leftovers. He loved it and it was his primary meal, however, while this was a common
practice twenty years ago, it is not considered a good idea today.




         Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                   47
In fact, it is recommended that apart from vegetables, fruit and some dairy, that you
avoid giving your dog human food. On one hand, feeding a dog table scraps and
human food can create bad habits. On the other, there are many fats, spices and salts
in our diets that is very unhealthy for our dog.


A dog that eats human foods can suffer from many health problems including obesity
and they are at risk of eating something that could be deadly to them.


When it comes to dog food, it is up to you to make a choice and it really comes down
to what works for both you and your dog.

Chapter 6: Switching Foods


Almost all dog owners, regardless of their experience with dogs, will have to switch
dog foods at one time in their life. It can be for a number of reasons like the dog food
was discontinued, the quality changed or because your dog was allergic. Whatever
the reason for switching foods, it can be a difficult thing to do and it can be quite
frustrating for the owner.


Of course, it doesn’t have to be and if you follow the advice in this chapter, you can
easily switch your dog food without too much of a stomach upset from your dog. I do
want to mention that their dog food shouldn’t be switched on a regular basis since the
switch is a mini-shock to your dog’s system. Instead, you should try to find a dog food
that works for your dog and stick with it.




BARF Diet


The first thing that I would like to talk about, before I even look
at switching your dog food is the BARF diet. This is a diet that
is becoming very popular and more and more dog owners are
switching to it, especially after the dog food scares of the past.


If you are unsure what a BARF diet is, it is a homemade diet that is designed to
recreate a natural diet that the ancestor of our dogs ate. It is believed to be the easiest
digested diet and it gives them everything that they need nutritionally.


There is some debate on raw diets but the most successful BARF, also known as
Biologically Appropriate Raw Food or Bones and Raw Food, is one that takes into
consideration four food groups that dogs need for optimal health. These are:




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    49
       •     Fresh, raw meat: This should be a high quality meat
             which syntheses to what a dog would have eaten after
             hunting.


       •     Green vegetables: While wild dogs didn’t eat a lot of
             vegetation, they did consume some when they
             consumed herbivores. This gave them the right amount
             of greens in their diet.


       •     Raw, organ meats:          Again, dogs were primarily
             carnivores and often ate the organ meats first.




       •     Uncooked bone: While people disagree with feeding
             bone to a dog, it is an important part of BARF diet,
             although it should be only be a small part of it.


With the BARF diet, all of the ingredients are mixed together to provide your dog with
the best dog food for only a fraction of the cost of regular dog food. But why is there a
push for BARF?


The reasons are the many different benefits that a raw diet offers a dog. These are the
following:


       ü Less expensive than commercial dog food.
       ü Better growth rate for puppies
       ü Lower stool volume
       ü Dogs that eat BARF are usually more energetic
       ü Fewer health problems such as allergies and arthritis
       ü Better weight maintenance
       ü Better jaw, neck and shoulder development
       ü Natural with fewer fillers, and by-products




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  50
There are so many reasons to choose a BARF diet for your dog but ultimately, it is up
to you on whether this is the direction you want to go with your dog’s diet.




Switching Foods


When it comes to switching your dog food, the best piece of advice that I can give you
is to do it gradually. It is important to take the better part of a week, if not the whole
week, when switching your dog food. This gives your dog time to adjust and will really
cut down on the problems associated with switching.


If you don’t do the switch gradually, and choose to do so quickly, you can run into a
number of problems that can cause a lot of distress for your dog. These problems are:


       ü Heartburn
       ü Stomach Cramps
       ü Vomiting
       ü Indigestion
       ü Diarrhea


In addition, switching too quickly can result in your dog refusing to eat and this can
lead to long-term problems and even severe weight loss.


When you are switching, the best course is to transition between two of the same
types of foods. So if you are switching from a dry, the best results for a switch would
be to another dry dog food. The same can be said about wet. However, if you are
trying to switch from a wet to a dry, you can do so but it needs to be done over a
longer period than just one week.


Another key point with switching is to limit the amount of times that you switch your
dog food. Switching for supply or even price can lead to a lifetime of stomach and



        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                   51
digestion problems in your dog. A switch should only occur if it is necessary and you
shouldn’t switch back and forth between two different dog foods.
Lastly, if you are switching from a puppy food to an adult food, it is much better to
choose a dog food from the same brand. This keeps his food consistent and,
generally, it shouldn’t affect him as much as switching brands would.


To switch your dog’s food, you should follow the steps provided below:


Step One:


Start by introducing your dog to the new food. This is done during the regular feeding
times but instead of giving him a bowl of new dog food, you would offer him a ratio of
3:1- three parts of his current dog food and 1 part of his new dog food. So, for
example, if he is eating two cups of dog food in one meal, you would offer 1 and a half
cups of current and half a cup of new. Offer this blend for about 3 days and keep
careful watch on his stools. If he has no digestive problems, you can move on to step
two. However, if you see diarrhoea or any other digestive problems, wait a few more
days before continuing on.


Step Two:


Once he is able to eat a 3:1 ratio, you can move on to a 2:2 ratio- half-old food and
half-new food. Again, watch for digestive problems and continue on this for 2 to 3 days
before you increase the ratio of new dog food.


Step Three:


It may seem like a long process but at this stage, you should be at a 1:3 ratio of old
and new dog food. Like the other steps, you should keep a close eye on his digestion
and only move forward if your dog is still experiencing no complications from the new
food. Again, continue this ratio of food for 2 days.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                52
After the two days, if there are no problems with the dog food, you can move forward
to using only the new dog food.


One thing that I would like to mention is that if you have any problems with diarrhoea
and/or vomiting, it is best to offer your dog one meal of rice. This should help with the
stomach problems, but if it doesn’t and the diarrhoea persists for several days, you
should consider using a different dog food.




How to give a more varied diet


One thing that I often hear from people is “How do I vary my dog’s diet?” It is a
common question since for many of us, our dogs are more than just a family pet, they
are one of our family members. It is very easy to humanize our dogs and once we do
that, we often think of ways to give them the very best in food, bedding and even
clothing.


We love our pets so when we sit down and actually look at dog food, we are left
wondering where the variety is. I mean, it doesn’t look appealing and from the smell,
the taste has to be just as bland and boring. We look for ways to make their diet
varied and this is often the problem that we get into with table scraps.


The first thing I am going to say about a varied diet is this, varied should be through
snacks and not through the actual dog food. Manufacturers, or you if you are making
your own dog food, add a variety of ingredients to create a well-rounded dog food that
offers variety and nutritional value. Switching back and forth between diets doesn’t
offer your dog a varied diet. What it does offer him is an upset stomach and, more than
likely, diarrhoea.


Instead, what you need to do is supplement his diet with the variety. You can do this by
purchasing different dog treats; however remember that anything your dog eats can




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  53
upset his digestive system. Offer variety in small quantities and watch to make sure a
food doesn’t cause any side effects before you deem it safe for consumption.


If you would like to offer some people food for a little bit of variety, the following foods
are safe for a dog to eat.


       •   Plain Yogurt: This is actually very safe for dogs and has several benefits,
           especially for female dogs. Choose a yogurt that doesn’t have any artificial
           sweeteners in it. You can serve it cold or you can freeze it for a yogurt
           Popsicle in the summer.
       •   Pumpkin: This gives your dog some much needed fiber as well as a little
           variety.
       •   Green Beans: Taste great, full of vitamins and has very few calories so
           they can help with maintaining your dog’s weight. They also taste great
           frozen.
       •   Apples: Dogs have a sweet tooth and apples are a great way to give them
           a sweet treat without the sugar. One word of advice is that you should
           always core the apple and never allow a dog to eat the core. Apple seeds
           contain cyanide, in small quantities this isn’t a problem but it is better to be
           safe.
       •   Sweet Potatoes: Another source of fiber, these can actually be dehydrated
           to use as a chewy treat for your dog.
       •   Eggs: Cooked eggs are good for a dog and can offer them many benefits
           since it offers them a protein boost.
       •   Oatmeal: Finally, oatmeal is a nice treat that gives your dog extra fiber, just
           don’t offer it with milk and sugar.
       •   Carrots: A fail safe treat, they make an excellent crunchy snack for your
           canine.


When you are choosing treats to offer variety in a diet, it is important to make sure that
you never offer them anything that is dangerous. For more information dangerous
foods for dogs, read chapter twelve: foods to avoid.

What flavors dogs like best


Dog’s like people, all have different taste so it can be difficult to determine what flavors
a dog will like best. To give you an example, two Labrador Retrievers, a breed known
to be food driven, were offered carrots for a treat. One dog ate the carrots readily while
the other took one bite and spit it out. When apple was offered the reverse happened.
It was clear that the dogs had tastes they preferred and it was easy to guess which
treat they wanted.


The same test that was used with the Labrador Retrievers has been used by pet
manufacturers to determine what flavors to add to their food. What they have been
able to come up with is the following.


Overall, the most successful flavor with dogs is a meat taste. Beef ranks the highest in
the meat flavors but it can differ from dog to dog. After meat, studies have shown that
dogs really do have a sweet tooth and will eat anything sweet. This is probably one of
the reasons why Easter chocolate is so tempting to them, even though it is very toxic.


In addition, dogs also tend to like the taste of cheese and finally they can love honey
and even carrots. When it comes to flavors that your dog likes, it is best to find it
through trial and error. Offer your dog different treats and allow them to be the judge.
If they eat it, then you know that it is a hit and if they ignore it, then you should try a
new treat.


Finally, an excellent way to give your dog the best flavor in their dog food is to warm
the food slightly. This allows the scent to escape the food much easier and the more
odors the food has, the better it will taste.

Chapter Seven: Feeding Schedules


When it comes to feeding your dog, I often recommend that you create a feeding
schedule for them. This means that you feed your dog at the exact same time each
day and that you give them a certain amount of time for feeding. I have found over the
years that feeding your dog in this manner makes it much easier to see what they are
getting and also gives you a bit more control over what is happening in that area.


However, not everyone agrees with feeding schedules and when you think about it,
there are pros and cons. On the other hand, there are pros and cons of free feeding
and before I discuss creating a schedule for your dog’s meals, I think we should
address the whole matter of free-feeding versus scheduled feeding.




Free-Feeding vs. Scheduled Feeding


With free-feeding, a lot of good things can be said about it. Let’s face it, free-feeding
makes it easy and all you have to do is pour the food in and then stop worrying. More
than likely your dog finishes it off throughout the day and some may even finish it off
within the first hour of it being out. It is simple, fast and there is no fuss.


If you look at free-feeding in that light, it might make you wonder why more people
don’t do it. However, a lot can be said about providing your dog with scheduled
feedings and while I would never criticize someone for free feeding, there are many
reasons why you shouldn’t even if you own a small breed.


Training:


Training is one of the reasons why scheduled feeding is better than free-feeding. When
you give the dog food, he quickly learns that all good things come from you. He




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  56
doesn’t forget it by the end of the day and he comes to rely on you for the necessities
in life.


In addition to the training aspect, housetraining is much easier when your dog doesn’t
have a constant supply of food. Because his meals are at a scheduled time, his bowel
movements are more predictable, which leads to knowing when to take your puppy
out.


On the other hand, if your dog is free-feeding, he will learn to be more independent
from you and this can be a positive if you prefer a more independent dog. Also, with
some breeds, training is not affected in any manner if the dog free feeds.


Bonding:


Although it may not seem like it, scheduled feeding gives you an opportunity to bond
with your dog. Talking to him, reaching into the dog food bowl and feeding him by
hand, petting him and just being present lets your dog know that you are a positive
force in his life. In addition, dogs are pack animals so feeding in the company of a
cherished pack member helps establish the hierarchy in your home.


With free-feeding, it can be hard to be in the room when your dog is eating so there is
no opportunity to interact with him and his food bowl. Your dog eats when he wants
and how much he wants and this can lead him to believe that he is the boss in the
house.


Health:


While free-feeding can offer your dog the full nutrition that he needs, it can be much
harder to gauge if he is getting enough. Many dogs who free feed don’t eat the full
recommended serving every day. Instead, they pick and choose when to eat and
many times the food dish is full. If they do happen to eat everything, many owners will
make the mistake of putting in more food, which leads to overeating.




           Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.             57
Regardless of whether your dog eats a little or a lot, he could be receiving the wrong
nutritional values for the day and this can affect him in his long term health. This is
often one of the biggest problems with free-feeding, the unknown over what your dog
is eating.


With scheduled feeding, you know how much your dog is eating and you are also more
aware of how your dog is feeling. If you place the food dish down and then come back
ten minutes later to find your dog not eating, you are more likely to act on it.
Scheduled feedings ensure that your dog is receiving the right amount of food each
and every day.


So to recap everything, Free-feeding offers you and your dog:


    ü More convenience
    ü Ample opportunity to eat
    ü Builds on the dog’s independence
    ü Allows your dog to graze at his leisure
    ü Scheduled feeding offers you and your dog:
    ü Opportunities for training
    ü Control over the amounts he eats
    ü Allows you to establish a bond and a hierarchy
    ü Makes his bowel movements predictable
    ü Allows you to monitor his health


Typically, large dogs, especially those that are more dominant, are fed on a schedule.
This solves many problems with dominance and the housetraining benefit is worth it.
Another typical fact is that small breeds, especially toy breeds, are free-fed, however,
for all of the same reasons as stated above, it is actually beneficial for them to be fed
on a schedule. It is something that I recommended for every dog owner, regardless of
the breed they have.

Creating a Feeding Schedule




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  58
If you have decided on feeding your dog on a schedule, there are a few ways that you
can do it. The ideal is to start right from when you bring them home as puppies and
usually you can use the same schedule that the breeder has done, altering it slightly to
fit into your own needs.


Before you begin a feeding schedule, there are a few things that you should know and
they are actually things that people are often confused about.


How Much Should I feed my Dog?


The amount of food that you will feed your dog will actually change depending on a few
factors.


       1. The age of your dog: Generally, puppies eat less than adult dogs so as they
             age, the amount of food they receive will increase. In addition, many senior
             dogs eat less than a young adult dog so later in your dog’s life, the amount
             will begin to decrease.
       2. Your dog’s weight: Many people use this as the only way to measure food
             but it shouldn’t be. Yes, it plays a factor but age and the overall health of
             your dog will affect the amount.
       3. Your dog’s activity level: The amount of exercise your dog receives, as well
             as his energy level will affect his food amount. The more active he is, the
             more calories he will need every day.
       4. Your dog’s vet recommendation: If your dog has a number of health
             concerns or if he is overweight, the amount of food your dog eats will
             change.


Before you choose the amount, take into account all of the above and then cross
reference it to the dog food you are using. Remember that the better quality the dog
food, the less food you are going to give your dog to reach the proper amount of
calories.




           Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                59
One last thing I want to mention about the quantity of food is that puppies and young
adults eat more than older dogs. In addition, smaller dogs eat more to their body
weight than larger dogs. The reason for this is that smaller dogs often have higher
energy levels so they tend to burn through calories much faster than a larger dog.


How many times should I feed my dog?


At one time, people believed that feeding a dog once per day was enough but recently,
more and more studies have shown that dogs require at least two meals a day. The
basic way to think of it is to think about your own eating schedule. How would you feel
going all day with only one meal? Yes, the meal is large but it just doesn’t get you
through everything you are doing.


Generally, I recommend that you feed your dog twice a day at least once they are 6
months of age. This should be done in the morning and the evening and you would
simply split their daily food amount in half for each meal. For puppies under 6 months,
it is better to feed them three small meals. This means that you should have someone
come in the middle of the day, usually around noon, to let the puppy out and to feed
him.


If your dog is a larger breed, especially one that is prone to bloat, which can be caused
by eating too much in one sitting, it may be better to offer 4 or 5 small meals per day.


When should I feed my dog?


Another consideration with creating a feeding schedule is the time that you should feed
your dog at. If you are on two feedings each day, then I recommend having a feeding
in the morning and in the evening. It is important to schedule the feedings so your dog
won’t have to wait long periods before being let out. Also remember that most dogs
need to relieve themselves between 15 to 20 minutes after eating. So you should
never feed your dog right before bed or right before you leave for the day because that
will only set him up for failure.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  60
I find the best way to feed your dog is with the following schedule:


           Time of Day                              Activity

      7:00am Wake Up         As soon as you wake up, let your dog out to relieve
                             himself.
      7:10am Breakfast       Usually having a meal while you get ready for your
                             day is the best way to do this. It also gives you a
                             good half hour before you have to take him out
                             again.
      7:40am Play Time       To make your dog’s day easier and to ensure he
                             gets the exercise he needs, take him out for a final
                             potty break and a bit of playtime before you leave
                             for work.
      8:00am Crate Time      This is when you would go to work or start your
                             actual day.


As you can tell from the table, exercise should be done after your dog eats because it
gives him an opportunity to go to the bathroom again and it also gives him the
opportunity to burn off a bit of the energy that the food gives him.


In the evening, you would follow a similar routine and you should try to stop offering
food about 2 hours before you go to bed so there are no middle of the night bathroom
breaks.


When you are creating a feeding schedule, it is better to program it into your own day.
Choose a time that works best for you and make it a habit. Usually most dogs won’t
have a problem adjusting their eating schedules to your schedule. The key point is to
offer more than one meal each day and to also offer enough time after the meal for
them to relieve themselves. After that, it is simply a matter of making the schedule
work for you.

Switching from free-feeding to scheduled


The last thing that I would like to talk about is actually switching your dog from free-
feeding to scheduled feeding. This can actually take a bit of patience and I know that it
can be very stressful for owners, especially when their dog isn’t eating. Remember,
before you start that your dog is used to doing things his way. He eats when he wants
to and he can take one or two bites and then come back later. It is a routine that your
dog is used to and you basically have to start from scratch when it comes to eating.


Begin your schedule the exact way that you want it to be. Don’t start off small and grow
because your dog will need to adjust each time and this can be very difficult. If you are
planning on feeding him at 8 in the morning and 6 in the evening, then do it from the
beginning. Next, offer your dog his food but give him a deadline for eating. 15 minutes
is usually enough time to get him to eat and if he doesn’t, then you are going to have to
suppress your worry and just pick the food up.


Do not give him any food until the next scheduled feeding. Remember that your dog is
used to grazing and if you are constantly giving him food in between his scheduled
meals, he will continue to graze.


At his next scheduled meal, offer him food again. Do not give him his full daily amount,
even if he didn’t eat during the last feeding. This will only fill him up and the next time
it is time to eat, he won’t. If you are worried about his calorie intake, offer him a little bit
more food but only a small increase. Dogs will eventually eat so if he goes a day or
two without eating, don’t worry. He’ll eat when he is hungry.
Repeat until he begins to eat at each scheduled feeding. I find that during this time, it
is better to feed him in a quiet place where he can’t leave. This gives your dog a clear
signal that now is the time to eat and it keeps him from wandering away and ignoring
his meal.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                         62
So when you are starting a feeding schedule remember these key points:


   ü Offer at least two meals per day.
   ü Feed in the morning and in the evening but leave enough time afterwards to
       take them out.
   ü Pick up the food after 15 minutes whether he has eaten or not.
   ü Only offer food during scheduled times.
   ü Fit the schedule into your own routine so it is easier for you to remember.
   ü Feed him in a quiet room where he won’t be distracted and is more likely to eat.


Lastly, if you have more than one dog, it is important to offer them food in separate
rooms until you have established the schedule.

Chapter Eight: Dog Food Supplements


The question of supplements is always a heated discussion and it can be confusing
since both sides are right about whether your dog needs supplements or not. On one
hand, most dog foods are manufactured in such a way that they provide the best
nutrition for your dog. There may be no need for supplements when your dog is young,
however, that often changes as your dog gets older. On the other hand, not all dog
foods are made to a high quality and a dog can benefit from taking a supplement.


In fact, there are many benefits that supplements can provide your dog including:


   ü Better health
   ü Shinier coat
   ü Better digestion
   ü More energy in your dog
   ü Promotes healthy circulation
   ü Stimulates the immune system


Really the benefits can be endless so even with a good quality dog food, choosing to
use a dog food supplement will only increase the overall quality of your dog’s life.




Necessary Supplements


When it comes to choosing to supplement your dog’s diet, it is important to remember
that there are only some vitamins that will benefit your dog. These are the essential
vitamins and all canine multi-vitamins have them, however, there are many vitamins
that are advertised to dog owners that really aren’t needed.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                   64
While dogs need a range of supplements, two of the most important supplements for
puppies are Vitamin A and calcium, both of which aid in the growth and development
of bones and muscles.

Vitamins



The first supplement that we are going to look at is vitamins. These can be found in
two types, water-soluble and fat-soluble. The main difference between the two is that
water-soluble is flushed from the body much faster than the fat-soluble vitamins, which
are stored in the body’s fat.


In this section I will go over a variety of vitamins that are essential for dogs and I will
also mention symptoms of a vitamin deficiency and symptoms of when your dog is
being given too much of one vitamin.


Vitamin A:


Vitamin A is often associated with growth and development. It has many functions and
is linked to good vision.


Deficiency: Vitamin A is linked to growth so dog’s that have a deficiency can suffer
from a lower growth rate. In addition, vision and skin problems can be seen as well as
diarrhoea.


Overdose: Vitamin A can cause serious bleeding disorders in dogs that are given too
much. Vomiting and diarrhoea is also seen, as well as significant hair loss. Lastly,
because vitamin A is linked to growth, too much of the vitamin can cause bone
deformities.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    65
Vitamin B Complex:


Vitamin B complex is an important vitamin that helps your dog in a range of ways.
They help with the overall health of your dog’s skin and coat and they also help the
heart, digestion and the function of the thyroid. Vitamins in the B complex are:


       •     Vitamin B1 (thiamine)
       •     Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)
       •     Vitamin B3 (niacin)
       •     Vitamin B4 (adenine)
       •     Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)
       •     Vitamin B6
       •     Vitamin B7 (biotin)
       •     Vitamin B9 (folic acid)
       •     Vitamin B12

Deficiency: Dogs that are lacking in vitamin B can suffer from nervousness and
irritability. In addition, they can have hair loss and skin problems and can suffer from
fatigue.


Overdose: Since this is a water soluble vitamin, there is usually a very low risk of
overdose since the excess is flushed out through the urine.


Vitamin C:


Although everyone views vitamin C as a safe vitamin, it is not something that is
needed by dogs. Studies have proven that dogs produce vitamin C in their livers by
using minerals that they digest. However, vitamin C does build collagen, which is used
for tendon and ligament health and very low doses can improve your dog’s health. It is
important to discuss vitamin C with your veterinarian before you give it to your dog.




           Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                 66
Deficiency:     If a dog has a deficiency in vitamin C, you will notice more dental
problems and a slower healing process. In addition, your dog may be breathless from
time to time.
Overdose: Since this is a water soluble vitamin, there is usually a very low risk of
overdose since the excess is flushed out through the urine. However, in some cases,
dogs have experienced problems with their liver and kidneys.


Vitamin D:


Vitamin D is a vitamin that we commonly receive from the sun, although it can be
found in smaller amounts in dog food, and other foods. It is a vitamin that is needed
but it can present very serious risks if it is administered incorrectly. It is important to
only give your dog vitamin D if it is recommended by your veterinarian.


The main benefit of vitamin D is that it aids in absorbing calcium. In addition, it
provides protection against many diseases including cancer.


Deficiency: Vitamin D is a very important vitamin and when a dog has a deficiency in
it, they can develop rickets and nerve disorders. Puppies with low vitamin D will have
weaker muscles due to poor development and in all dogs vision problems can occur.


Overdose: Dogs can be given too much vitamin D and this can lead to an increase in
urination, along with nausea and vomiting. In addition, it can lead to the calcification of
muscles.


Vitamin E:


Vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin and it is an antioxidant that maintains a healthy coat,
aids in growth and development, and improves the protective mucous membranes that
reduce susceptibility to infections. Vitamin E aids in both bone and teeth formation.


Deficiency: If a dog has a deficiency in vitamin E, the dog may develop bleeding
disorders.


        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    67
Overdose: Unlike many of the other vitamins, there is no known problem when a dog
has a high level of vitamin E in his system.


Vitamin K:


Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin so it is stored in the body longer than other vitamins.
The main benefit of vitamin k is in the production of blood. Vitamin K helps stimulate
the production of coagulation factors.


Deficiency: The main risk when there is a vitamin K deficiency is miscarriage. Since
many dogs are spayed, this deficiency doesn’t pose a risk to the average household
pet. However, a low level of vitamin K in some dogs can be a bleeding disorder


Overdose: Unlike many of the other vitamins, there is no known problem when a dog
has a high level of vitamin K in his system.




Fatty Acids



Fatty acids are very important for the overall health of dogs and can be linked to many
health benefits. One of the easiest seen is a healthy coat and a reduction in arthritic
problems.


The two fatty acids that are needed by dogs is Omega 3 and Omega 6. They help
improve the coats health and aid in the development of natural oils that protect the
skin.   They are linked with helping block out infections and also with reducing
inflammation.


Deficiency in fatty acids can lead to a very dull coat as well as dry and itchy skin, which
makes the dog prone to both allergies and infections.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    68
Minerals



Minerals serve the same functions as vitamins and are very important in the overall
health of your dog. As I did with vitamins, I will look at how the mineral helps your dog
and also a few symptoms of a deficiency.


Calcium:


Important for bone formation, calcium also keeps bones strong. Calcium is found in a
number of foods but it is important in a supplement.


Deficiency: A deficiency of calcium can lead to severe problems with the strength of
the bones.


Copper:


Linked with the metabolism, copper is also used by the body to produce melanin,
which is the pigment in coat and skin. It is important to consider your breed before you
supplement copper since some breeds can suffer from copper toxicosis. This can lead
to hepatitis and cirrhosis in some breeds such as the Bedlington Terrier.


Deficiency: A deficiency in copper can lead to anemia as well as a bone disorder.


Iron:


Iron is a very important mineral and is linked with healthy red blood cell development,
which aids your dog’s overall health. It can be a difficult mineral to absorb and there
are many products that can actually interfere with iron absorption.


Deficiency: A deficiency in iron can cause fatigue, decreased growth rate, and
increased sensitivity to stress and diseases and anemia.



        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  69
Magnesium:


Magnesium is a mineral that really works with other minerals. It works with calcium for
heart development, potassium and sodium for metabolism and on its own in the
development of soft tissue and bone.


Deficiency: Although convulsions are seen when there is a deficiency of magnesium,
usually muscle weakness is the more common symptom.


Potassium:


This mineral is linked to bone formation, similar to calcium, but it also works with tissue
cells and promoting healthy cellular activity.


Deficiency: A deficiency in potassium can lead to heart and kidney lesions and can
also cause muscle weakness.


Sodium:


Sodium is linked to promoting healthy cellular activity and bone formation. When there
is an excess of sodium in a dog’s diet, there can be an increased risk to hypertension.


Deficiency: There is rarely a deficit of sodium in a dog’s diet and there are no known
symptoms to a sodium deficiency.


Zinc:


Zinc is important for a healthy coat and skin and it also aids in enzyme functions. It is
not needed in as great a quantity as other minerals but it is still important.


Deficiency: A lack of zinc in your dog’s diet can lead to poor growth, skin lesions and
testicular atrophy in male dogs.


        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    70
The last minerals I would like to mention are selenium and manganese. Currently
there are no studies to the effects that these two minerals have on a dog but we do
know that they are good for a dog. It is important to find a multi-vitamin that has low
levels of both selenium and manganese.



Muscle Supplements



The last supplement that I want to look at is a muscle supplement. Before you even
look into a muscle supplement, I want to dispel one myth about them, they do not aid
in the growth of your dog. They won’t make your puppy bigger or your dog overly
stronger.


What they will do is build healthy muscles on your dog so that he has a healthy body
weight and so his immune system is given a kick start.          In addition, your dog’s
digestion and circulatory system will benefit from the overall health of your dog.


Muscle supplements are good for working breeds that travel a lot, and compete or
work for long hours. In these cases, the muscle supplement strengthens the muscles
and joints so the dog is much better at recovering from the stresses of competing,
travelling and working.


It is also important to remember that muscle supplements, especially ones that are a
steroid, should only be given at the recommendation of your veterinarian.            The
development of healthy muscles comes from a good diet and plenty of exercise and a
muscle supplement will only aid your dog in maintaining those muscles, they will not
build them.

Giving a Vitamin


One challenge that supplements present for an owner is actually giving it to the dog.
For some dogs it can be as easy as placing it out for them to take and for others, it can



        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  71
be mixed into the food and swallowed easily. However, there is a large group of
canines that will carefully eat around the pill and then leave it in the dish for you to
clean out.


It can be frustrating and while we would all like to have an easier time giving a pill, if
your dog is difficult, you will need to give the supplement by force. To do this, simply
follow the directions below:


   1. Place your dog in a sit position and try to have him sitting against a wall. This is
       to keep him in one spot since many dogs will begin to move back to get away
       from your hand.
   2. Hold his head with your one hand and place it gently on the muzzle. You
       should have your thumb on one side and your fingers on the other and you
       should have the rest of your hand on the top of his muzzle.
   3. With the other hand, carefully lower his jaw by gently pushing down on his front
       teeth. The best way to maneuver is to have the pill ready in your hand between
       your thumb and pointer finger.
   4. Once the mouth is open, rest your palm on his lower teeth and drop the pill into
       the dog’s mouth. It is important that you do this very quickly and that you put
       the pill just past the hump of the tongue. Not too far back that he will choke but
       not too close that he can spit out the pill.
   5. Close his mouth and hold it firmly in your hands so he can’t open it. Lower his
       head for easier swallowing and stroke his throat gently to encourage him to
       swallow.
   6. When he swallows, release his muzzle and then give him plenty of praise and a
       treat or two for being such a good boy.


It can take a bit of practice to get used to feeding a dog but once you learn how to do
it, giving your dog his vitamin will become very easy. The main thing that you have to
remember is to keep it positive for your dog or it can cause some behavioral problems
in the long run.

Purchasing Vitamins for your Dog


The last thing that I want to mention is how to properly purchase your dog vitamins. It
can be a bit confusing and there really are a number of products out there and just like
dog food, a number of them are sub-par.


It is very important, before you give your dog vitamins, to discuss this with your
veterinarian. He will be able to tell you what vitamins will help your dog and which
ones are really not necessary. Since he knows your dog’s health more intimately than
I do, it is always best to take his recommendation first.


Next, you should really look at the vitamins that you are going to purchase. In general,
there are four things that you are going to look for in a vitamin and this will give you
some idea of whether it is good quality or not.


Number One: What type of research has been done on the vitamin


This usually isn’t available on the label but it is important to look the vitamins up on the
web before you purchase them. Find out how effective the tests were, if the vitamin
preformed to its expectations and if there were any side effects. Don’t just stick with
the information on the company’s website but also search through dog forums that list
vitamins so you have a comparative from people who have actually used them.


Number Two: Does it present a safety risk


Make sure that there are no recalls on that specific vitamin or if there is an
investigation looking into reports about the vitamins safety. In addition, check the
ingredients list and make sure that there are no hazardous by-products listed.




Number Three: Check the levels


        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                     73
Every vitamin should have a list of the daily percentage or daily amounts that is
supplied in each pill. Check through the levels and match them with your dog food.
Although it may be tempting to purchase a vitamin with high levels, it should be
combined with the dog food levels so you don’t inadvertently give your dog vitamin
poisoning.


Number Four: Make sure your dog can tolerate it


Although you may not find out otherwise until after you try the vitamins, it is a good
idea to check that ingredients list again and make sure that there is nothing in it that
will affect your dog negatively. If you find that he begins having digestion problems
after taking the vitamin, make sure that you stop use immediately and consult with your
veterinarian.


Regardless of the manufacturer, only purchase vitamins that have contact information
and a help line so you can contact the company directly if you have any questions.

Chapter Nine: Special Feeding Considerations


When it comes to feeding a dog, everyone knows that each dog is different. In
addition, every stage of a dog’s life is different when it comes to feeding your dog and
so the amounts that they will need. A puppy will require a different feeding schedule
and food than an outdoor dog. In addition, a spayed female will have different
nutritional needs than a pregnant female.


In this chapter, I will look at the many different feeding considerations that you may
need for your special canine.

Puppies


As you know, puppies go to their new homes on puppy food at
about eight weeks of age.        Generally, most puppies are
weaned onto food by four weeks of age, although they will not
be completely weaned until they are closer to seven or eight
weeks of age. From there, they should be given a puppy food
that is high in protein.


Puppies need protein for growth and development and an adult food does not have the
right amount.


When you are feeding a puppy, it is important to follow the recommendations below:


Young Puppy: 8 weeks to 6 months of age


        •   At least three meals per day
        •   Feed according to weight
        •   Offer water with food and for more food driven breeds, it is recommended
            that you float the food in water so it slows their eating down.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                 75
Older Puppy: 5 or 6 months, until 1 year of age


         •    Begin to reduce feeding to twice a day
         •    Feed according to weight


With a puppy, it is important to set a schedule and to only offer food for a certain
amount of time. In addition, feeding is recommended according to weight but if your
puppy is not active, you will need to decrease the amount slightly.


Regardless of the activity level of your puppy, keep a close eye on his weight. The
perfect way to determine his weight is to not see ribs when he is standing but to be
able to feel them under a thin layer of puppy fat. If you can’t feel his ribs, he is too fat
and if you can see his ribs perfectly, he is too thin. Reduce or increase his food as
needed but make sure you speak to a veterinarian if you see a major decrease or
increase in your puppy’s weight.

Adults


Once your puppy has reached a year old, he has begun
the process of becoming an adult. He should be switched
at this age to an adult food but speak with your
veterinarian before you do. It may be recommended that
you wait a few more months if there is any concern about
his health.


When it comes to feeding an adult dog, a lot of the decisions will factor in your dog’s
activity levels. Two dogs of the exact same weight and age can have completely
different feeding considerations if one is active and one isn’t.


Before I look at the differences that activity makes on a diet, I want to mention a few
things that are the same regardless of your dog’s activity levels. First, all dogs should
be fed at least twice per day, no matter how active they are. If your dog is more active,
it may be better to offer him three or four meals but it isn’t always necessary.


         Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    76
Second, all dogs should have a healthy weight. To determine this, be aware of the
breed standard and then check your dog’s build. A dog that is in perfect weight should
have a waist as well as ribs that can be felt under a thin layer of fat. You should not be
able to see the ribs and his weight should not be tucked in to the point that he looks
emaciated. If you find that you can’t touch the ribs, then he is too heavy and if you can
see the ribs, then he is too skinny.


Another thing that can be common for both active and inactive dogs is the appetite.
Many times a dog’s appetite will fluctuate from day to day. Some days he will eat fine
but every once in a while he won’t. This is nothing to be worried about unless he goes
through several days of not eating. A day with less food from time to time is not going
to hurt, although two or three days without eating should give you enough concern to
seek veterinarian advice.


Now that I have looked at the similarities between the two, you should know the
differences. First is activity level.


If your dog is sedentary, then the basic feeding plan is needed. However, he may need
to have a reduction in his food in regards to his weight. This should only be done if
you notice he is getting overweight.


For active dogs, the required amount of food will be slightly higher since they burn
more calories in the day. It is important to look at your active dog’s life throughout the
year because there may be periods when he is less active. During these times, reduce
the food again to keep him at a healthy weight.


In regards to actually feeding your active dog, it is important to pick feeding times
about an hour to two hours after his most strenuous exercise during the day. While
exercise before or after feeding can be safe if it is moderate, a very active dog is more
likely to have strenuous exercise, which can increase the risk of gastric torsion and can
also cause digestion problems.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                   77
The best recommendation for feeding is a small meal
in the morning and then a larger meal in the evening
after the dog has settled down for the night. The
final exercise of the evening can be a simple walk to
relieve himself before bed.


All adult dogs should be monitored and if there are any concerns about their eating
habits, a veterinarian should be consulted.

Seniors


When it comes to senior dogs, feeding can again revert back to the way that you fed
your puppy. Many times, older dogs require two or three meals per day so that a large
meal doesn’t disturb their digestion.


Generally, a senior dog is less active and should have fewer calories per day. They do
need to be on a quality dog food that is specially designed for senior dogs. However,
be careful when picking a senior blend since many offer fewer calories but end up
lowering the nutritional percentages.


As with all other dogs, a healthy weight should be maintained and this is very important
with senior dogs since excess weight can put stress on their joints.




Pregnant Dogs


Feeding a pregnant dog can be tricky, not because it is
difficult but because there tends to be a lot of conflicting
information on it. Everyone seems to have a little advice
on feeding a pregnant dog but when it comes down to it,
there are two separate stages that you should look at
with the pregnant dog.



        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                 78
For most dogs, the gestation of a litter is roughly 63 days, although some can whelp
sooner and some can whelp later. During the first four or five weeks of gestation, your
dog is in the first stage of pregnancy when her puppies are not growing as quickly as in
the second. During this time, her appetite, and weight gain is fairly normal, however,
your bitch will need to be switched gradually from her regular dog food to a puppy
blend. This puppy blend will give her the nutrients she needs to carry the litter to term.


When she reaches five or six weeks of gestation, that is the time when her diet will
need to change. First, your dog’s food rations will need to be increased. Generally, if
your dog was in good health before the pregnancy, she will need to gain between 25 to
30% more weight. For this reason, it is recommended that you increase her food by
25 to 30% by the fifth or sixth week and may go up to 50% by the end of the
pregnancy.


Second, as the puppies grow, you will also need to change her eating habits and offer
her smaller meals since the puppies can cause her stomach upset.


A few days before whelping, usually 24 to 48 hours, your dog will either decrease her
food intake drastically or she will stop eating completely. This is the indication that she
is ready to whelp. Other than those recommendations, nothing else needs to change
for your pregnant dog.

Bitches in Heat


Feeding a bitch in heat doesn’t have to be a huge problem and for the most part, you
can feed her exactly as you would feed an adult dog. There are no changes needed,
especially if you aren’t getting her ready for a pregnancy.


You may find that she has a decreased appetite and it is
important to monitor her eating habits and weight to make sure
she doesn’t loose too much weight.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    79
If you are planning on breeding her, it may be a good idea to start to gradually switch
her diet to a puppy food. This will give her the nutrients that she needs right from the
start of the pregnancy and will keep her from losing the puppies.




Nursing Dogs


Once your dog has whelped her puppies, she will
begin to lose weight and can lose a surprising
amount, up to 10%, with good maintenance on the
part of the breeder. It is a busy time for the dog and
she needs all the calories that she can get to feed her
puppies.


During lactation, it is important to keep the female on puppy formula food and talk to
your veterinarian about any other vitamins or supplements that she may need. It is
also important to offer three meals each day and to have water available to her
constantly.


With the actual amounts, you should increase her food by two or three times her
regular amounts. The best rule of thumb is to offer her 2 times her food the first week,
2 and a half times the second week, 3 times the third week and then back down to 2
and a half by the fourth week. By the sixth week her puppies will be weaned and she
should be back to eating at 1 and a half times her normal weight until the puppies are
gone completely. This can change depending on the size of the litter and also on the
weaning process.

Outdoor Dogs


The last dog that I am going to look at is the outdoor dog.
Although more and more people are bringing their canines
indoors, there are still outdoor dogs and they do require a slightly
different feeding regimen.




First, feeding an outdoor dog should be done according to the season. In the summer
months, when it is hotter, a regular amount of food should be given and at times,
slightly less.


During the cooler months, food should be increased slightly so the dog is given more
calories. These extra calories will offer him an increase in body fat, which will make it
much more bearable to be outside. It is important to keep your dog at a healthy weight
but in the winter, keep his weight at the higher range than in the other months.


Second, an outdoor dog should be fed two or three times per day. This isn’t really for
any food considerations but many outdoor dogs can become unsocialized and feeding
time can give you the opportunity to socialize your dog.


Lastly, an outdoor dog should have a constant supply to fresh water regardless of the
time of year.


When it comes to feeding quantities, every dog is different and will have different
calorie needs. For a more in-depth look at the calorie needs for your own dog, visit our

Chapter Ten: Dog Treats and Chews


You can’t have a book about nutrition without talking about dog treats and dog chews.
Let’s face it, these are part of our dog’s lives and we often use treats for training, for
stimulation or simply as a way to say “I love you” to our dog.


The problem is, there are hundreds of dog treats out there on the market and many
people, even owners who purchase the very best dog foods for their dogs will often
choose a sub-par dog treat for their pup. In this chapter, I will take you through
everything you need to know about dog treats and chews so you will make as informed
a choice about them as you do about dog food.

All about Dog Treats


If I were to sum up dog treats in one sentence, it would simply be, “remember that dog
treats add calories to your dog’s diet.” If you are aware of this statement, most people
can easily navigate through the world of dog treats without too much trouble.


However, if I were to look at dog treats more thoroughly, there is a lot to learn about
them. For instance, are human snacks okay? The answer is yes if you are offering
safe fruits and vegetables, which you can learn about what to avoid in chapter twelve.
This is a question that should be answered.


But before we get into all the different types of treats you can give your dog, we should
look at the role of treats in your dog’s diet. It is important to remember that dog treats
are just that, a treat, something good that tides your dog over until the next meal or is
simply a way to praise the dog for a good dead.


They shouldn’t be used to replace dog food since many treats are considered a dog
junk food, however there are a few that are nutritious and healthy for your dog.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                   82
The main role of dog treats is for training and using them to condition your dog to be
good through positive reinforcement, however, that isn’t the only use for treats. Using
them for ways to keep your dog entertained while you are away and also as a special
treat during a stressful situation, such as a vet visit are common uses for treats.


In fact, treats are so commonly used that most dogs receive several within a period of
a week. The main thing to remember with treats is to never overuse them and never to
use them when a dog is misbehaving.



Are Dog Treats Nutritious



One question that many owners wonder about is whether treats are nutritious. The
answer is both yes and no and really it depends on what type of treats you are using.
If you are using human foods such as fast food or ones that are high in spices and fat,
then the answer is no. There is nothing nutritious that the dog will receive from the
treat.


In addition, if the dog is being given too many treats, than any nutrition that could be
found in the treat is forgotten with the many problems that obesity can cause in dogs.


On the other hand, if you are offering fresh fruit, plain yogurt and nutritious dog treats,
along with careful consideration of the dog’s diet, then treats are very nutritious.



Safe Treats



Over the years, pet owners have become much more knowledgeable about what is
good for dogs and what isn’t. This can be applied to treats and really, there are a
number of excellent dog treats that you can purchase and later in this chapter, I will go
over 24 of the main brands and what makes them good for your dog.




         Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                   83
However, before I look at those treats, I want to mention three rules for choosing a
safe treat for your dog.


   1. No preservatives and additives.
               The first thing that you should do is read an ingredients list on the dog
               treats. This will give you some idea of what is in them and you can
               cross reference them with chapter twelve and ingredients to avoid. If
               you find that there are a high percentage of additives and preservatives,
               then you should choose a different treat since those chemicals have
               been linked to a number of diseases.
   2. Doesn’t present a choking hazard.
               The second thing is to make sure that the treat doesn’t present a
               choking hazard. Ask yourself a few things. Is it small enough for my
               dog to chew and swallow? How does it break apart? Large pieces or
               small pieces which can be easily swallowed?
   3. Is it digestible?
               There have been a large number of dog treats that have been wonderful
               when it comes to nutrition and to taste but when it came to digestion,
               there was suddenly a huge problem. Make sure you do your research
               before you use a treat since any digestion problems can lead to a
               serious condition called impacted bowels.


If you choose to give your dog human food for treats, remember that there are a
number that can be hazardous to dogs. However, the following treats are very good
for them and don’t pose a risk to their overall health.


       ü Raw carrots
       ü Bananas
       ü Canned pumpkin (not the type that
           has the pumpkin pie spices in it)
       ü Apples (remember to remove the
           seeds)
       ü Watermelon


        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                 84
       ü Strawberries



Teething Treats



If you are wondering what teething treats are, they are
simply treats that you can use when your puppy is
teething. Some great treats are ones that are soft and
chewy and feel great on the teeth. It is important, when
purchasing a teething treat, to pick one that doesn’t break
apart into pieces that can choke your puppy. In addition, a lot of chewing can cause
your dog to swallow a lot of saliva and this can cause stomach upset.


Although there are treats that you can purchase specifically for teething, you can also
make your own. Freezing yogurt is a perfect teething treat that can sooth the gums but
make sure that you give it to your puppy outdoors since it can get very messy.

Training Treats



Training treats are small treats that you can use for training
your dog.      This type of treat is used with positive
reinforcement training so your dog learns that good behavior
is rewarded with a food.


These treats should have a strong taste and smell so the dog is encouraged to do the
desired behavior. They should also be a soft treat that is easy to chew and swallow.
The harder it is to chew, the more distraction, the harder training can be.


While there are many training treats on the market, I recommend choosing a treat that
can be cut into bite sized morsels, no larger than the nail of your pinkie. This size may
seem too small for a larger breed but the main desire for the training treat is to give
them a burst of flavor without the distraction. Keeping the treat small makes it perfect
for dogs of all sizes, including toy breeds.

Treats for Puppies



Treats for puppies generally serve a number of purposes. One of the main reasons is
using them to offer your puppy something to chew instead of him chewing the furniture
or worse. Another reason is to use them as a reward, in the same way that you would
use a training treat.


When you are looking for a treat for your puppy, follow the same guidelines as you did
for a teething treat. Remember that they should be small enough that they fit in your
puppy’s mouth comfortably but not too large or too small to pose a choking risk.
Lastly, be aware of any risks to the digestive tract that the treats could pose.

All About Dog Chews


Although we have already gone over a large number of
treats for your dog, it is important to look at chews as well
as the treats. If you are unsure of the difference, a dog
treat is usually a small snack that your dog eats quickly, a
dog chew gives your dog something to chew on over time.


The main difference between the two is that a dog chew is
usually used to curb destructive chewing and to give your dog something to do. In
addition, dog chews are better for the development of the jaw and for good dental
hygiene, since there are many dental chews available.


As with all other treats, it is important to find a chew that won’t break off into small
bites, which often pose a choking hazard but can also lead to an impacted bowel. In
addition, you should find a chew that doesn’t have a high sodium level. While this can
taste great to a dog, it is not healthy for them to have a high level of sodium.

Bones as Chews



Many people are unsure about bones and there is a lot
of contradicting information on whether you should use
them or not. Generally, I recommend that you don’t.
Chicken bones and pork bones will often split and while



        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                 93
this may not be a problem, the sharp edges of a broken bone can cut or scratch
delicate organs in the digestive system. In addition, the way that they break can lead
to a choking hazard.


If you are looking for a bone for a chew, make sure you
purchase a beef bone with marrow. These are usually large
enough where they can’t be swallowed and come in one
large bone. In addition, the marrow is digestible and very
good tasting to a dog.


However, if you are interested in offering your dog a large beef bone, you should
remember that it can be a very messy treat. In addition, the beef bone can cause
digestion problems and can lead to diarrhoea so you should limit the amount of time
your dog gets to chew the bone if he has never had it before.



Recommended Servings


When it comes to recommended servings of dog treats, it really is different depending
on the type of treat you are giving your dog. If you are using them for training, then
you usually won’t exceed any limits with the food since the pieces are so small.


If you are giving them to your dog as a reward, I would recommend only giving them
two to six a day, depending on the size. Remember that whenever you give a dog
treat to take into consideration his calorie intake. If you find the treats nudge his
calories       over      the    recommended         amount,       as     found      at
http://www.trainpetdog.com/calorie-calc.html, you should reduce the amount of food
that your dog receives that day so there isn’t an increased risk of unhealthy weight
gain.

Chapter Eleven: Feeding your Dog when you are Traveling


Travel can always be an adventure and when you
are traveling with your dog, it can be an even bigger
adventure. Whether you are travelling by trains,
planes or automobiles, there are a dozen finer
details that you need to take care of before you set
out on the road.


One of those details is feeding your dog when you are travelling. Before I actually look
at this detail, I want to mention a few things on getting ready for travelling.


Just as you would prepare your suitcase and passports, one of the most successful
ways to deal with your dog’s diet on the road is by preparing for it. When you travel,
many dogs suffer from stress and this, in turn, affects their diet. They don’t eat as
much and they may have a few digestive problems along the way.


Before you set out, make sure you pack a doggy care bag. This should include their
favorite treats, their food, food dishes and water dishes. With the food, pack enough for
your trip and then add an extra day or two just in case something happens to delay
your return trip home.


You should also talk to your vet to see about travel sickness pills for dogs. I don’t
recommend using them every time you travel but having them in your emergency kit
can be a lifesaver, especially if you are going a very long distance.


Once you have your kit ready, then you can head out and enjoy your trip, however,
there are a few rules that you should follow in order to have the best vacation without
worrying about your dog’s eating habits.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  95
Rule Number 1: Keep to a routine


This is particularly hazardous when you are driving but if you decide to stop for fast
food on your way do not purchase them for your dog. First, the added fat and salt is
not good for your dog. Second, it can start a bad habit. And third, it can cause stomach
and intestinal upset, which can lead to diarrhoea and vomiting.


Rule Number 2: Avoid fast food


This is particularly hazardous when you are driving but if you decide to stop for fast
food on your way, do not purchase them for your dog. First, the added fat and salt is
not good for your dog. Second, it can start a bad habit. And third, it can cause
stomach and intestinal upset, which can lead to diarrhea and vomiting.


Rule Number 3: Don’t feed your dog on the move


While it may seem like a good idea at first, feeding your dog in the car as you drive can
lead to them vomiting in the car. Instead, pull over when they need to eat, stretch your
own legs as they eat and then take them for a short walk to allow the meal to settle.
This will decrease the amount of stomach upset your dog experiences.


In addition, while bones may seem like something for your dog to do, the excess saliva
that they are swallowing while they chew a bone can cause upset when they are in the
car. Leave the bones and other treats until they are at the destination.


Rule Number 4: Offer plenty of water breaks


One recommendation for traveling with a dog is to take plenty of breaks when you are
driving. This is usually done for potty breaks. While I recommend this as well, make
sure that you offer water during each break. It may make your break a bit longer but
your dog will be a lot happier with the ride.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  96
Rule Number 5: Expect some problems


Although this isn’t really a rule, it is a great philosophy to live by. There are going to be
some problems with your dog. Travel is always stressful on a dog, although some are
affected less than others, it is bound to upset their routine. This can lead to digestive
and stomach problems, which can be difficult to handle. When this happens, decrease
the amount of food slightly and let your dog adjust to the travel.


Also, many dogs tend to decrease the amount they eat when they travel. This can be a
concern for owners but don’t worry too much; your dog will eat when he is ready to.


Feeding your dog when travelling doesn’t have to be too difficult but it is important to
follow the rules. If you plan ahead, feed on a schedule and in a quiet place, your dog
will not only make it through the trip, but will also enjoy it.

Chapter Twelve: Foods to Avoid


The last thing that I would look at when it comes to your dog’s diet is foods that you
should avoid feeding your dog. We have all heard the recommendations about what
types of dog foods to choose and also about the dangers of feeding a dog table scraps
but let’s face it; very few people follow those recommendations.


It can be difficult to look at your dog and say, “No,” especially when he is giving you the
cutest look you can imagine. However, while people food is not ideal for a dog, there
are a number of dog food ingredients that are also bad for your dog and it is important
to be aware of them.


In this chapter I will take you through everything you need to know about all those
foods you should avoid feeding your dog.

Dangerous Dog Food Ingredients


As I have mentioned, there are often many ingredients in dog food that is not good for
your dog. Sure they aren’t life threatening but at the very least, they really aren’t
needed. In addition, there are some that have been linked to cancers and other
problems in dogs. Although a holistic diet is one of the best that you can purchase for
your dog, some owners are not always able to offer it but they can check the
ingredients list to minimize the risk to their dogs.


Please remember that in the lists below, some of the foods are only offered in certain
countries and banned in others.         Do your homework and check your country’s
restrictions before you select a dog food.

Additives:



Additives are usually chemicals that are used to preserve the flavor and appearance of
the food and to also improve the taste. There are also additives that help lengthen the
shelf life of the pet food.


Glyceryl Monostearate:


This is an additive that is widely used in dog foods for a variety of uses. It is often
used as a preservative to give food a longer shelf life. Although it is not clear what risk
Glyceryl Monostearate presents, there is some indication that it can lead to cancer.
Glyceryl Monostearate is also found in the following chemicals:
        •    butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)
        •    glyceryl distearate
        •    glyceryl tristearate


Propylene Glycol:


The use of this has been decreasing but it is still used in many different countries to
keep semi-moist dog food from drying out. While it is not toxic in small amounts, large
amounts of it can lead to death in an animal. In fact, the chemical is used in things like
antifreeze and solvents.


Phosphoric Acid:


This is often used to give the dog food flavor but it also works as a discoloration
inhibitor. Phosphoric Acid is believed to be harmless but there really is no need for it
to be in dog food.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                    99
Flavoring Agents:



These are also additives but they are specifically designed to add a certain flavor to
the dog food. While these can be perfectly healthy for your dog, many of these
flavoring agents present an unknown and that is the reason that you should try to avoid
them in your dog food.




Digests:


You can actually find a range of digests in your dog foods. Chicken digest, pork
digest, lamb digest and so on. One thing about digests is that it is used to create a
specific flavor. So for instance, chicken digest gives the dog food a chicken flavor.
Usually to create this flavor they use animal tissue from the specific animal,
unfortunately, while it is from a specific type of animal, it doesn’t have to be from a
specific part of an animal or even from a specific stock. With the chicken digest, they
can use any type of chicken; regardless if it was diseased, for the digest. In fact, digest
is often created by using “4-D animals”. That means any animal that is dead, diseased,
disabled or dying prior to slaughtering them can be used. It can include euthanized
animals and even road kill.


The problem with using 4-D animals is that there is no quality control and the animals
could be contaminated, which in turn, can contaminate the dog food.


As I have mentioned earlier, these aren’t necessarily bad, since some companies
make an effort to use healthy meat for their digests but they do present a risk for your
dog so it is better to avoid them.

Glandular Meal:


This is another grey area that no one is certain about. In fact, most experts on dog
food scratch there head on it. They do know that it is used as a flavor, just like digests
are, but they aren’t sure how it is made. Because of this, it is better to avoid glandular
meal since there is a good chance that the meal was made using 4-D animals.




Flavor:


Another vague word is that could mean anything from a natural spice to a chemical.
Usually listed as flavoring, there is no detailed information on how that flavoring is
made. Since it is unclear, try to avoid it in your dog food.

Coloring:



The simple fact of consumerism is in coloring. If something doesn’t look nice to our
eyes, then it can’t taste right in our mind. It is a simple science and while dogs won’t
care what the color is, owners do. If the dog food looks discolored, they aren’t going to
want to feed it to their dogs. However, there have been some serious illnesses linked
to food dyes so it is better to avoid them if you can.


Blue 2:


This is just a basic blue found in many dog foods. It has caused brain tumors in mice
but no studies have seen any cancers in dogs, however, the data on this is limited.


Yellow 5:


This has been linked to mild allergic reaction, however, of the two yellows that are
commonly used, this one is the less dangerous than Yellow 6.


Yellow 6:



          Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                101
Yellow six has been linked to several cancers seen in dogs, including cancers in the
adrenal glands and the kidneys.


Red 40:


This is one of the most commonly used food dyes. Currently, there is no data on how
it affects animals but it is recommended that you avoid foods with red 40 dyes in them.


Titanium Dioxide:


The last coloring is Titanium Dioxide, which is often used to give dough a white
pigment. There are no known diseases linked with titanium dioxide but it is also a dye
that really isn’t necessary.




Preservatives:



As I have mentioned, preservatives are used to lengthen the shelf life of the food as
well as the flavor and the color. They are linked to several diseases.


BHA and BHT:


Also known as Butylated Hydroxysanisole and Butylated Hydroxytoluene, these are
chemicals used to preserve the fats in foods. They are both linked to several cancers
and have been banned for use in human products in several countries, although many,
including the United States still use them.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.               102
Propyl Gallate:


This is a chemical that is used as an antioxidant in foods with fats. It has been linked
to cancers as well as liver disease and can be found under the names of Gallic Acid
and Propyl Ester.




Ethoxyquin:


This is a common pesticide that is used on fruit to prevent scald, specifically on apples.
It is also used as a color preservative in dog food and has been linked to several types
of cancers. In addition, it has been linked to many diseases including disease of the
kidney and thyroid.




Binder:



Binders are commonly used as a way to thicken food or to give it a certain texture.
Generally, there are no problems with binders, except they don’t offer any nutritional
value to the food; in fact, they actually decrease the quality of the food. Some common
binders found in dog food are corn gluten and wheat gluten.




Fillers:



Although I have listed ingredients that are dangerous to your dog, below is a list of
items that you should avoid since they do not provide any nutritional value to the food.
They are often used as fillers and affect the overall quality of the food. Below is a list of
fillers that are commonly found in dog food and you should try to find a dog food that
doesn’t have them in the ingredients list:

   ü Oat Hulls
   ü Rice Hulls
   ü Peanut Hulls
   ü Beef Tallow
   ü Poultry Fat
   ü Lard
   ü Wheat Mill Run
   ü Soybean Mill Run



Supplements:



In many dog foods, there are a number of supplements that can be found in the
ingredients list. Most supplements are there to add flavor or they are left over as a
result of processing. Some dog foods offer special vitamins but studies have shown
that adding supplements to dog food is not necessary and they don’t need to be there.
For the most part they don’t pose any risks to your dog, however, they are often the
“junk food” part of the meal and while the occasional treat is okay, dogs do not need a
full diet of sugars and salts.


Some common supplements that can be left out of a dog’s diet are the following:
   •   Sweeteners such as:
           o   Sugar
           o   Corn Syrup
           o   Fructose
           o   Cane Molasses
           o   Sorbitol



        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.               104
   •     Synthetic Vitamin K
   •     Synthetic Vitamin E
   •     Salt
   •     Mineral Oil
   •     Bone Phosphate
   •     Yeast Culture

Meals:



The last thing that you should avoid in your dog food is meals. These are usually made
from parts of an animal or crop that is unsuitable for people to eat. It is a low-grade
product that decreases the overall quality of the dog food. In addition, some meals
contain mystery meats where there is no clear indication where the meat came from.
So while it may say “liver meal,” it could be the liver of any type of animal from chicken
to horse. When you find ingredients that list it as “by-product meal,” you are actually
getting parts of the animal such as the head, feet and bones.


While meal does offer some nutritional value, it is only used as protein filler and it is
usually harder for your dog to digest. Some meals that you can find in dog food are:


   ü Beef Meal
   ü Bone Meal
   ü Chicken Meal (with or without the by-product)
   ü Poultry by-product Meal
   ü Blood Meal
   ü Meat Meal
   ü Fish Meal
   ü Liver Meal
   ü Bone and Meat Meal
   ü Pork and Bone Meal
   ü Corn Germ Meal
   ü Corn Gluten Meal

People Foods to Avoid


Although I have gone through a whole list of dog food ingredients that you should
avoid, one of the biggest problems with a dog’s diet doesn’t come from the pet store.
Instead, it actually comes from the grocery store and from an owner that wants to offer
their dog a special treat.


Let’s face it, everyone has looked into the sad eyes
of a hungry canine and thought, I should offer him a
little bit of my ham sandwich. I mean, what can one
little bite hurt. The answer is that it can hurt quite a
bit because it becomes a habit to continue to offer
little human treats to our dogs.


One of the biggest problems that human food can
cause in dogs is obesity. Often human food is seen as
a treat but it is given in too high of an amount and the
dog’s calorie intake is increased during the day. Over
a long period of time, those calories turn to fat and your
dog becomes overweight. Another problem is that human foods can be toxic for dogs.
If we just set aside the additives in our food, such as sugar and salt, there are many
foods we can eat that can actually kill a dog if they eat it.


It is important to know which foods cause serious problems and which ones don’t when
you are feeding your dog.




        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.               106
Vegetables:



Onions:


Onions can cause a serious condition in your dog-called
Heinz Body Anemia. It is a very serious illness that can lead to
premature death in a dog. Onions are extremely toxic and
they are one food that can easily be placed into your dog’s
diet. Many foods that we cook with and prepare have some
sort of onion, whether it is powder or diced, and this can lead
to anemia occurring over time in your dog.




Mushrooms:


With   mushrooms,      there   are   some    people   that   claim
mushrooms are okay for dogs but the simple fact is they aren’t.
Although some kinds only cause digestive upset and diarrhoea,
there are several that are toxic enough to cause shock in a dog
and result in death.


Garlic:


Garlic has the same effect on dogs as onions, however, it
is usually not as toxic to dogs. However, it should be
avoided.




          Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.   107
Potatoes:


Although not as toxic as mushrooms or garlic, potatoes can lead
to digestive problems and urinary tract infection. In addition, they
can lead to anemia. Other vegetables that have the same effect
on dogs are rhubarb and tomatoes.




Fruits:



Grapes and Raisins:


Grapes and raisins contain a toxin in them that can
affect the dog’s kidney function. In small doses there
may not be too much of an effect, however, larger
amounts of grapes can lead to sever pain for your dog
and eventually to renal failure.


Citrus Fruits:


Any type of citrus fruit such as orange, lemons and
grapefruit are not good for your dog. They can cause
vomiting.


Avocados:


Avocados are poisonous to dogs and can cause food
poisoning, and if left untreated, death.




          Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.   108
Pit Fruits:


While eating a fruit with pit is not dangerous for a dog if the pit is removed, the actual
pit of the fruit can lead to obstruction in the intestines.



Meats and Proteins:



Raw Eggs:


Although the risk for salmonella poisoning is high, there is an
added risk because of an enzyme found in raw eggs called avidin.
The enzyme decreases the absorption of vitamin B and can lead
to many problems with your dog’s skin and coat.


Macadamia Nuts:


Macadamia Nuts are poisonous to dogs and can cause food
poisoning, and if left untreated, death.



Raw Fish:


Raw fish also results in a deficiency of a Vitamin B and the lack of
this vitamin can lead to seizures and even death.




Junk Food:



Chocolate:


Most people are aware of the risk that chocolate presents and it
should never be given to a dog. It can send a dog’s heart rate up



        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                  109
very high and can lead to vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition,
chocolate can cause seizures and can lead to either a coma or death.




Caffeine:


While coffee or any caffeine drink gives humans a boost, it
actually negatively affects the heart and nervous system of
dogs.




Alcohol:


Although it may seem funny, and we have seen it done in
movies, alcohol is very dangerous for your dog. It is poisonous
for dogs and can cause food poisoning. In addition, this can
lead to a coma or even death.




Table scraps


The last thing that I would like to talk about is table scraps. If you look at the list above,
you are probably aware of the fact that many of the foods we eat can be harmful to
dogs. For this reason, it is recommended that you avoid treating your dog with table
scraps at all since we often use many of the “high risk” foods when we are cooking.


In addition, table scraps usually have high quantities of salt and/or sugars and this can
lead to health problems in your dog including obesity. Feeding a dog table scraps can
lead to behavioral problems as well as begging and even demanding food at the table.


While it is better to say no to table scraps, I do understand that it can be difficult to do
this. If you do feed your dog table scraps, it should only be done on a minimal basis,



        Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Trainpetdog.com All Rights Reserved.                     110
once or twice a month tops, and it should only be foods that you know are safe for
canine consumption. One of the best ways to solve the table scrap problem is to fry up
some meat without any spices or oils and feed your dog that. Use a beef or a chicken
without bones since pork is harder for a dog to digest.


When it comes to giving your dog that extra special treat, any type of dog biscuit is
sure to make your dog happy and more importantly, it will keep him healthy.

    We simply LOVE this game. It develops crazy good
    focus, awesome foundations for loose lead walking
    and proximity value, it helps to level energy in a
    super awesome way, it is arousal balancing and also
    engaging and FUN! Games don’t get much better
    than this one!
    Top Tip: Can your dog catch? Yes I know it does sound
    very very simple, why not give it a go? Start by not
    even thinking too hard on the game itself and actually
    just do the art of catching - it’s a skill in itself! It may
    sound easy but really, just go out and give it a go.....

    Step 1: Without your dog have a handful of food in an
    upturned hand, maybe 5-10 pieces maximum and drop
    it from your hand to the floor through your fingers with
                                                                  Step 4: As your dog is getting better and better at the
                                                                  game and at catching you can start to make minor
                                                                  adjustments with your body to help them to work out
    you taking control! Make sure you decide when each piece      where to place themselves for future focus games on the
    should fall and at what pace. Adjust the height to make       move! Subtle and soft movements only please, nothing too
    sure that you are super comfortable without your dog!         big and dramatic, think more like weight shift style than big
    Top Tip: If you can do this well without a dog then           steps, keep it soft and adjust only very very slightly!
    try it on the other side, most handlers are better doing      Top Tip: Don’t try to move too far or too much
    it on one side than the other! It’s important you can be      before you have the subtle adjustments. These subtle
    versatile and do this exercise on both sides!                 adjustments are the foundation steps for success and
                                                                  they are FUNdamental!
    Step 2: Have your dog on lead at your side. Use your
    7-10 pieces of food and go to the same position that          Step 5: Take this show on the road. Try this in one new
    you have already practiced! Have your dog stand               place per day, just static at first, don’t add movement, static
    roughly under your hand and let food fall from the sky        only! Try this in a good few places and then gradually start
    as your dog starts to work out what is going on! Don’t        to add more and more steps in as you feel it’s going well!
    worry your dog probably won’t try to catch them just
    yet. Don’t rush as your dog will need time to adjust to       Magic Hand is a super game to teach:
    figure out where they are coming from!                        • Focus            • Foundation for proximity games
    Top Tip: There is no hurry at this stage. Try to wait         • Attention        • Body awareness
    for your dog to lift his head to re start the game. At that
    point let the food drop. Don’t adjust the food for your       We are sure you will find many more uses, these

    Step 3: Your dog is now starting to try and catch we hope
    - try to wait for the FOCUS up and as they do release the
    food from the sky. Your dog will get better and better at
    the focus up as you time it cleverly with the food falling
    from the sky! It’s the best way to reward spontaneously
    and your dog will never know when it’s coming as the
    hand is upturned so doesn’t really give any clues!

    • 	It creates a default bounce back! whenever your

                                                             Dogs can often find themselves wanting to
                                                             interact or react with things in the distance and

                           IN AROUSAL
    More often than not, the skills associated with focus,
    whether that is offering of eye contact, orientation to
    you, listening to you - are not the problem, but rather
    whether these can be performed as the arousal
    (excitement) levels increase.

    Like most things, this ability to focus in high
    arousal comes with practice, and here’s a game
    we love to play for this:

                              CUE CONTROL
                              IN AROUSAL
    Step 1: Place something one metre ahead of your dog
    on the ground that they absolutely love, for example
    high value food, toy, or eventually (once you get good
                                                                 Keep an eye on the monthly “3 Minute Inspiration”
                                                                 challenges as we tackle all of these on there each
                                                                 month! There are many behaviours you can put on
    at this game) maybe even a real-life event, e.g. their dog   verbal cue - many are super easy and fun and will help
    friend or a swimming opportunity.                            you out and about with off lead control!

    Step 2: Gently hold your dog by their harness, send your     There are then four possible outcomes from this:
    dog to go and “get it” and then let go of their harness!     1) They perform behaviour correctly, send them to “get it”.
                                                                 2) They don’t perform the behaviour correctly and try
    Step 3: Repeat this until your dog is clearly anticipating
                                                                 to get the food or toy regardless, jump ahead and beat
    getting the exciting event!
                                                                 them to it (make it a bit of a competition!)

    Step 4: This time ask for a behaviour they know on           3) They don’t perform the behaviour and look a little
    verbal cue - for example, sit, down, spin, etc.              like they are stuck on the spot, like the lights are on
                                                                 but nobody is home. This is because they are too
    Top Tip: Do you have any verbal cues? Don’t worry if
                                                                 aroused (excited) to be able to function at that level.
    you don’t, fast track now to middle and start teaching
                                                                 Calmly stroke them on the side, get them moving a
    that one! And with verbal cues if your dog doesn’t
                                                                 little to stop the stickiness and try again now that their
    already know any others then we like to teach:
                                                                 arousal levels are a little lower.
    • Sit                  • Tall         • Head low             4) They don’t perform the behaviour correctly and
    • Down                 • Left         • Bend                 manage to beat you to the toy. What do you think you
    • Stand                • Right        • Middle               should do? Laugh about it - it’s no big deal and you
    • Pretty               • Reverse                             know for next time to change things up.
    To be honest the list is non exhaustive.
    We hope you get to have fun with it!                         Play this with all kinds of rewards, all kinds of cues
                                                                 and higher and higher excitement levels to help teach

    So many dog training and behaviour struggles go
    back to deficits in the relationship between dog and
    owner. It’s easily fixed when you realise three things:
    	
    1) 	Relationship is impacts and is impacted by every 	
    	 interaction with your dog!
    2) 	Relationship is completely changeable!
    3) 	You are in control of how good your relationship
    	 is with your dog!

                                  RELATIONSHIP
    Look at it as a bank account - the more in the
    bank account, the better the relationship!

    You can pay into your relationship bank account by
    having an interaction with your dog they like - it might
                                                               All Eyes on Me!

    be playing with them, training them, rewarding them        a piece of food or toy in order to get or upping the level of
    for doing something you like, even cuddling them!          environmental distractions - fun, fun, fun!

    Interactions they don’t like - things like intimidation,
    being punished, told off or even you getting
    frustrated with them - withdraws from the
    account and makes it lower!

    Up your positive interactions, reduce your negative
    interactions and your relationship increases.
    Of course, there are going to be times when things
    don’t quite go to plan, but, with this framework,
    you can compensate for the occasional negative
    interaction by doubling up on the positives
    in response!

    A game that works well in investing in the
    relationship bank account is building eye
    contact as a positive interaction.

    The benefits of middle are huge:
    • 	It acts as a portable boundary so that your dog
    	 can stay focussed and confident no matter the 	
    	 exciting or scary environment
    • It lowers arousal
    • It gets your dog into a safe place QUICK

    HOW TO PLAY:
                             “MIDDLE”
    Step 1:  We like to shape this trick, which means            Step 4: Build duration into maintaining position between
    rewarding successive approximations of the final             your legs by providing a rapid rate of reinforcement in this
    behaviour - or rewarding things your dog does that are       position. Then work on reducing the rate of reinforcement
    closer and closer to the final behaviour in mind!            while your dog stays in one place.

    Step 2:  To do this, we mark and reward turns and steps      Step 5: Now work on the final behaviour, a sit! You can:
    towards behind us to start with, rewarding by placing the    1) Shape the sit by marking and rewarding weight shifts 	
    treat or toy behind us and eventually between legs.          	 backwards until your dog sits.
                                                                 2) Cue a sit, repeat a few times and then wait your dog out

                                                                 then using a hand target is a really good way to get this!
                                                                 Tucked sits are more accurate to maintain the final position
                                                                 and you can shape these also, or, if your dog has a specific

                                                                 Step 6:  Build duration into maintaining the sit position
                                                                 between your legs by manipulating rate of reinforcement

                                                                 now by rewarding for sit maintenance as you change

                                                                 introduce your cue (“middle”, “centre”, “position”) just before

Je suis heureux de vous offrir cet ebook !
                                        Fils d’un grand éleveur
                                   et    dresseur    d’épagneuls
                                   bretons, j’ai toujours vécu
                                   parmi les chiens de chasse et
                                   participé depuis mon plus
                                   jeune âge à leur éveil.

                                  Depuis que j’ai pris
                             conscience que les chiens
                             sont des êtres sensibles,
                             intelligents, je n’ai pas cessé
                             d’être     attentif   à    leur
  comportement, pour mieux les comprendre.
       Ainsi, j’ai pu élaborer une nouvelle méthode
  d’éducation qui veille à l’épanouissement du chien en
  lui permettant d’exprimer tout son potentiel.

      En 2016, j’ai écrit un livre : Les secrets des
  Keranlouan - Révolution dans l’éducation des chiens.
  car j’avais envie de partager mon expérience et mes
  connaissances, vous transmettre ma méthode. Ce livre
  remporte un vif succès, il est déjà traduit en 4 langues.

      Dans cet ebook, je vous livre quelques-uns de mes
  secrets, des réponses à vos questions, soucieux de
  contribuer au plein épanouissement de votre chien à vos
  côtés, quelle que soit la race !

  Patrick Morin produit des chiens d'arrêt d'exception en Bretagne : les
  Keranlouan, qui remportent de nombreux titres en France, en Italie et
  en Espagne.

                                                                           4
  L’éducation canine selon Patrick Morin


     Avant toute chose, quelle
que soit la méthode que vous
utiliserez, il est nécessaire de
faire preuve d'enthousiasme
communicatif         lors    des
exercices avec votre ami
fidèle. Un de mes clients
m'appela un jour pour me
dire que bien qu'il appliquât
à la lettre mes conseils sur le terrain, sa chienne
progressait très, très irrégulièrement dans son
entraînement. Il en parla à son épouse qui lui dit : « Moi
je n’ai aucun problème quand je m'amuse à faire répéter
les exercices à la chienne. » C’est vrai qu’elle le faisait
de façon enjouée, avec des intonations entraînantes, des
encouragements et des félicitations qui motivaient
l'élève ! Son mari, lui, faisait pratiquer ces exercices
avec sérieux et application...

     À travers cet échange, j’ai réalisé combien il m’est
naturel d'agir avec cet enthousiasme spontané lié à ma
passion pour mes Keranlouan, et ils le ressentent ! Tout
est donc dans l'intonation. Elle est différente selon qu’il
s’agisse d’un commandement sévère ou d’un
commandement qui repose sur la compréhension et
l'enjouement.

                                                              5
    Peu importe les mots, c'est avant tout l'intonation
qui compte.




     Je ne dresse pas les chiens, mais assure une
initiation de base du chiot que je mets très tôt en contact
avec la nature. Ainsi, je leur donne l’envie d’obéir en
me servant de leurs qualités naturelles.

    La base du dressage repose sur la connexion que
vous devez créer entre vous et votre chien.
    En fait, il faut établir un niveau de complicité en
conditionnant le chien à vouloir vous obéir.

     Pour y parvenir, il est important de tenir compte
de trois éléments fondamentaux :
     1) le chien est pourvu de l’instinct à la poursuite.
Il faut utiliser cet instinct pour faire venir le chien à
vous. Par exemple, en rentrant d’une promenade, si
vous vous mettez face à lui près de votre véhicule, il
comprendra que c’est la fin des réjouissances.
     Par contre, si au lieu de vous arrêter près de la
voiture, vous vous dirigez vers le champ voisin, le chien
va venir vers vous espérant poursuivre la promenade.

                                                            7
   Connecté à vous, vous le récupérerez plus facilement.
   Dans bien d’autres cas de figure l’utilisation de
l’instinct à la poursuite facilitera la connexion avec
votre chien pour une réelle complicité.
     2) le deuxième élément
fondamental, c’est de tenir
compte de l’environnement
où vous vous trouvez. Dans
une        zone     dépourvue
d’obstacles     naturels    ou
artificiels, l’animal court
sans réfléchir et devient
incontrôlable si on le laisse
se griser dans ces grands
espaces. Il est préférable de démarrer votre journée de
chasse dans des endroits relativement serrés, une prairie
d’herbes hautes, un bois, ainsi le chien se calera
naturellement sur vous. Ensuite, quand il se sera
défoulé, vous pouvez passer dans un endroit découvert.
     3) le troisième élément fondamental est le
commandement de frein. Votre chien a tendance à
partir loin devant vous, pour le maintenir à la bonne
distance, plutôt que de lui hurler : « Attends !!! »
     Glissez-lui :
     « Chuuut, chuuut, chuuut… Attends. »
     Des exercices réguliers de commandements au frein
augmenteront nettement votre puissance d’intervention.

    Je développe ces éléments dans le chapitre « Les
commandements de base du dressage », de mon livre
« Les secrets des Keranlouan ».

Peut-on se passer du collier électrique ?




     Oui ! Autant que possible.
     Quand on éduque un jeune chien, il est bon de
pouvoir le maîtriser.
     Vous accrochez au collier du chien une petite
cordelette d'un peu plus de trois mètres de long.
     En prenant en main ce cordeau à la suite du chien,
vous avez un prolongement de vous-même, un cordon
ombilical qui vous permet d'être en communication
permanente avec votre chien et d’intervenir plus
facilement selon le besoin.
     Dans certains cas particuliers d'échecs dans le
dressage, le collier électrique peut trouver une
justification. Mais jugé souvent efficace, il reste une


                                                          9
arme qui peut s'avérer très dangereuse pour le chien s’il
est mal utilisé.

     Le cordeau est un outil utile dans l’initiation de
base du chien, plusieurs cas de figure d'utilisation sont
présentés dans mon livre. J’y explique aussi comment
utiliser à petites doses, le collier électrique.

  Comment rappeler votre chien ?




    Beaucoup des gens crient constamment après leur
chien : « Au pied !!! », quand ce n’est pas autre chose...
Plus ils crient, plus ils s’énervent, plus ils entrent en
conflit avec le chien qui devient désobéissant.

    Notez bien ceci : appeler ne doit pas servir à faire
revenir le chien, mais à attirer son attention.
    Il faut que pour le chien, cet appel corresponde à
une offre réjouissante. Qu’il se dise : « Chouette ! Mon
maître m’appelle ! Un nouveau terrain de jeux ! »

    Dans mon livre, je démontre l’importance de la
connexion du chien avec son maître pour faire naître
une véritable complicité.

     La peur du coup de fusil




    La peur du coup de fusil vient toujours d’une
maladresse provoquée directement ou indirectement par
l’homme.
    Des chiens de chasse sont prédisposés à ne pas
avoir peur de la détonation d’un fusil. Mais après
l’acquisition d’un jeune chien, il faut faire très attention
à ne pas l’effrayer par maladresse ou par un
apprentissage mal adapté.
    Un chien timide et caractériel est souvent
prédisposé à avoir peur du coup de fusil, mais il possède
certainement de très bonnes qualités pour la chasse. Si
vous voulez mettre à l’aise votre jeune chien, vous
devrez le laisser se déchaîner sur le gibier. Ensuite,
après quelques sorties, votre élève sera obnubilé par la

                                                           13
recherche du gibier et concentré sur sa course. Il
attachera donc moins d’importance aux facteurs
extérieurs, particulièrement si au moment du coup de
fusil, il est en train de courir derrière un gibier. Il n’aura
dès lors aucune réaction au coup de feu.

     Il faut beaucoup de patience et de délicatesse pour
guérir un chien de la peur du coup de fusil. Il faut
réinitialiser sa vocation de chien de chasse.

    J’ai une méthode pour redonner du mordant à un
chien traumatisé, j’en parle dans « Les secrets des
Keranlouan », page 174.

  Mon chien ne rapporte pas




    Le chien ne rapportera pas un gibier s’il n’a pas eu
sa « dose d’excitation ».
    L'idéal est de faire travailler votre jeune chien sur
un gibier désailé. En le poursuivant, il va faire monter
son excitation, sa motivation et quand il l'aura attrapé, il
sera fier.
    À ce moment, il est indispensable de le laisser se
promener avec. Cela suppose de lui avoir mis
auparavant un cordeau de trois mètres environ. Le but
étant de le faire marcher le plus possible avec le gibier
dans la gueule, ainsi il ne cherchera pas à l’enterrer.
Puis, changer de direction plusieurs fois en tirant sur le


                                                           15
cordeau d'un petit coup sec, en utilisant le
commandement : « Viens ! »
     Enfin, vous le faites venir à vous avec assurance, en
le ramenant contre les genoux pour le féliciter, qu'il
sente l'odeur du maître, et le laisser donner le gibier à ce
moment.
     Il faut au moins dix séances de cinq minutes pour
faire progresser le chien, vous pouvez le faire avec un
apportable (une vieille paire de chaussettes avec un
double nœud).

    Quand le chien ne veut pas lâcher le gibier, plus
vous tenterez de le récupérer, plus le chien va résister et
planter ses crocs dedans.

   J’explique comment sortir de ce cercle vicieux dans
mon livre, page 166.

Préparer son chien à l’ouverture de la chasse


                                   Je fais la guerre aux
                              chasseurs qui utilisent leur
                              chien en période d'ouverture et
                              qui, après la saison, le laissent
                              au chenil pendant six mois !
                              Le chien a une sensibilité une
                              intelligence, une capacité à
                              interpréter ce qui lui arrive. Il
                              peut se renfermer et tomber en
                              dépression. Et lorsqu'il sera
                              sollicité à l’ouverture de la
                              chasse, comme il n’aura pas
  été entraîné, il sera asphyxié rapidement et ne travaillera
  qu'à 10 % de ses capacités. Le chien contrarié par ses
  contre-performances entrera en conflit avec son maître qui
  s’énervera dessus.
       On ne sort pas son chien 15 jours avant la saison de la
  chasse, mais tout au long de l’année de façon à maintenir
  la connexion avec lui, en utilisant les commandements de
  base.
       L'épanouissement de votre chien sera proportionnel au
  temps que vous lui consacrerez, des échanges de qualité
  sont nécessaires pour maintenir une belle complicité et des
  performances inégalables.

      Un chien, ça se mérite !

      Dans mon livre, j’évoque l’importance des exercices
  réguliers avec votre chien, toute au long de l’année, ce
  que j’appelle : l’affûtage du dressage.
